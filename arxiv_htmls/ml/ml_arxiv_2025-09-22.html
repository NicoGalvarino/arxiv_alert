  Multi-Scale Problems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Saeed Amizadeh, Sara Abdali, Yinheng Li, Kazuhito Koishida</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> In The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multi-modal (abstract), multi-modality (abstract), transformer (abstract), attention (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the
field of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data,
they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities
with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the
attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales
from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to
incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based
on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar
problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in
this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a
mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then
mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct
from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived
formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard
Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the
hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an
efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived
attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the
proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train
transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it
can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained
transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in
zero-shot manner.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16058v1" target="_blank"><h2>Attention Schema-based Attention Control (ASAC): A Cognitive-Inspired
  Approach for Attention Management in Transformers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Krati Saxena, Federico Jurado Ruiz, Guido Manzi, Dianbo Liu, Alex Lamb</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> variational autoencoder (abstract), VAE (abstract), neural network (abstract), transfer learning (abstract), transformer (title, abstract), attention (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Attention mechanisms have become integral in AI, significantly enhancing
model performance and scalability by drawing inspiration from human cognition.
Concurrently, the Attention Schema Theory (AST) in cognitive science posits
that individuals manage their attention by creating a model of the attention
itself, effectively allocating cognitive resources. Inspired by AST, we
introduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the
attention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial
experiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer
architectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise
attention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach
aims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both
the vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification
accuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision
transformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller
not only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization
capabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we
have showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments
reveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to
adversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and
facilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples. These
promising results establish a connection between cognitive science and machine
learning, shedding light on the efficient utilization of attention mechanisms
in AI systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15481v1" target="_blank"><h2>Solar Forecasting with Causality: A Graph-Transformer Approach to

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global
horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from
site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or
satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To
deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three
classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural
components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station
identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors
(e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural
network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across
stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It
outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse
geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top
commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and
generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15538v1" target="_blank"><h2>Geometric Integration for Neural Control Variates</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Daniel Meister, Takahiro Harada</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.GR, cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Control variates are a variance-reduction technique for Monte Carlo
integration. The principle involves approximating the integrand by a function
that can be analytically integrated, and integrating using the Monte Carlo
method only the residual difference between the integrand and the

approximators that could potentially be used as a control variate. However, the
challenge lies in the analytic integration, which is not possible in general.
In this manuscript, we study one of the simplest neural network models, the
multilayered perceptron (MLP) with continuous piecewise linear activation
functions, and its possible analytic integration. We propose an integration
method based on integration domain subdivision, employing techniques from
computational geometry to solve this problem in 2D. We demonstrate that an MLP
can be used as a control variate in combination with our integration method,
showing applications in the light transport simulation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15797v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transfer learning under latent space model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kuangnan Fang, Ruixuan Qin, Xinyan Fan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ME, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> latent space (title, abstract), transfer learning (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Latent space model plays a crucial role in network analysis, and accurate
estimation of latent variables is essential for downstream tasks such as link
prediction. However, the large number of parameters to be estimated presents a
challenge, especially when the latent space dimension is not exceptionally
small. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method that leverages
information from networks with latent variables similar to those in the target
network, thereby improving the estimation accuracy for the target. Given
transferable source networks, we introduce a two-stage transfer learning
algorithm that accommodates differences in node numbers between source and
target networks. In each stage, we derive sufficient identification conditions
and design tailored projected gradient descent algorithms for estimation.
Theoretical properties of the resulting estimators are established. When the
transferable networks are unknown, a detection algorithm is introduced to
identify suitable source networks. Simulation studies and analyses of two real
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15991v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quantum Enhanced Anomaly Detection for ADS-B Data using Hybrid Deep

The utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a)

the attack surface for DDoS, malware, and zero-day intrusions. We propose an
intrusion detection system that fuses a convolutional neural network (CNN), a

captures local and gated cross-feature interactions, while the AE emphasizes
reconstruction-based anomaly sensitivity. Training occurs across edge devices
without sharing raw data. On UNSW-NB15 (binary), the fused model attains AUC
99.59 percent and F1 97.36 percent; confusion-matrix analysis shows balanced

approximately 0.0476 ms per sample on our test hardware, which is well within
the less than 10 ms URLLC budget, supporting edge deployment. We also discuss
explainability, drift tolerance, and FL considerations for compliant, scalable

applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk
reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains
challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote
sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast
three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward
Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear,
and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind
dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind
retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with
skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios.
The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure
levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior
agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data.
Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for
localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations
(e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This
interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of
exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced
environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15810v1" target="_blank"><h2>Instance Generation for Meta-Black-Box Optimization through Latent Space

algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage
generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based
algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which
automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem
instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs
is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the
MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited
in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further
results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance
generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse
training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.
LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features
into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space
leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.
By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with
minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a
diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the
effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe
their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.
Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to
existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only
demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal
interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15578v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multimodal Learning for Fake News Detection in Short Videos Using

Bahadir Sahin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.IR, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dimensionality reduction (abstract), multimodal (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In large scale e-commerce marketplaces, duplicate product listings frequently
cause consumer confusion and operational inefficiencies, degrading trust on the

falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact
textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles.
To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product
deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach
employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in
conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these
architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce
compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss.
Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both

Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and
high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding
200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1

multi-scale dynamics and spectral multi-resolution periodicities. DPANet
constructs two parallel pyramids: a Temporal Pyramid built on progressive
downsampling, and a Frequency Pyramid built on band-pass filtering. The core of
our model is the Cross-Pyramid Fusion Block, which facilitates deep,

Yet, in modern
machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can
help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable
model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data
coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics,
we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based
on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic
dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A
'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can
help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates
out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially,
using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a
distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent.
Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data
augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and
isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic
risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas
from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern
machine learning phenomena.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15275v1" target="_blank"><h2>Partial Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Team Formation

strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial
column generation approaches from the literature, particularly on hard
instances solved under a tight time limit.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14519v1" target="_blank"><h2>BEACON: Behavioral Malware Classification with Large Language Model
  Embeddings and Deep Learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wadduwage Shanika Perera, Haodi Jiang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential
to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static
analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code
obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast,
behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a
more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior
reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each
sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D
CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public
CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the
overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15170v2" target="_blank"><h2>Watermarking and Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning Models for LORA
  RF Fingerprinting</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aarushi Mahajan, Wayne Burleson</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CR, cs.AI, eess.SP</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> variational autoencoder (abstract), VAE (abstract), convolutional (abstract), anomaly detection (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless
devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy
cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves
accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We
present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and
anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel
spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially
trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight
signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler
(KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset,
our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC,
offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15980v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shedding Light on Depth: Explainability Assessment in Monocular Depth

the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15593v1" target="_blank"><h2>SETrLUSI: Stochastic Ensemble Multi-Source Transfer Learning Using
  Statistical Invariant</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chunna Li, Yiwei Song, Yuanhai Shao</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transfer learning (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In transfer learning, a source domain often carries diverse knowledge, and
different domains usually emphasize different types of knowledge. Different
from handling only a single type of knowledge from all domains in traditional
transfer learning methods, we introduce an ensemble learning framework with a
weak mode of convergence in the form of Statistical Invariant (SI) for
multi-source transfer learning, formulated as Stochastic Ensemble Multi-Source
Transfer Learning Using Statistical Invariant (SETrLUSI). The proposed SI
extracts and integrates various types of knowledge from both source and target
domains, which not only effectively utilizes diverse knowledge but also
accelerates the convergence process. Further, SETrLUSI incorporates stochastic
SI selection, proportional source domain sampling, and target domain
bootstrapping, which improves training efficiency while enhancing model
stability. Experiments show that SETrLUSI has good convergence and outperforms
related methods with a lower time cost.</p></br></body>
