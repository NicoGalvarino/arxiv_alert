  Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xingjian Wu, Xiangfei Qiu, Hongfan Gao, Jilin Hu, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in
decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and
transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while
overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
(LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have
a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models
inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model
that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear
dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model
uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in
long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF,
providing a more efficient and accurate solution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23720v1" target="_blank"><h2>COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic
  Agents</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Arun Verma, Indrajit Saha, Makoto Yokoo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> This paper proposes a contextual bandit algorithm that prevents strategic agents from misreporting while having approximate incentive compatibility and a sub-linear regret guarantee</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23181v1" target="_blank"><h2>FreRA: A Frequency-Refined Augmentation for Contrastive Learning on Time
  Series Classification</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tian Tian, Chunyan Miao, Hangwei Qian</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, I.2.6</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> KDD 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised
representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation
strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time
series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation
methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series
data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the
semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched
patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel
perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for
downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize
the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency
Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on
classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive
learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA
automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components.
Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and
semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant
information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the
unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates
semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale
datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading
baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer
learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive
representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios
across diverse datasets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23624v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards Explainable Sequential Learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Giacomo Bergami, Emma Packer, Kirsty Scott, Silvia Del Din</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.DB, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper offers a hybrid explainable temporal data processing pipeline,

  Generalization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Eitan Levin, Yuxin Ma, Mateo Díaz, Soledad Villar</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, math.RT, math.ST, stat.ML, stat.TH</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 69 pages, 8 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying
sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for
domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on
graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional
data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this
body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across
dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in
a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent
large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We
instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the
necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design
principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support
our findings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23086v1" target="_blank"><h2>Equivariant Spherical Transformer for Efficient Molecular Modeling</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Junyi An, Xinyu Lu, Chao Qu, Yunfei Shi, Peijia Lin, Qianwei Tang, Licheng Xu, Fenglei Cao, Yuan Qi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced
molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their

thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a
Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after
Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can
encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior
expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed
through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular

  LSST Precursor Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anthony Englert, Ian Dell'Antonio, Mireia Montes</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Intracluster light, the diffuse glow of stars stripped from galaxies during a
cluster's formation, is an established tracer of a cluster's dynamical history.
The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
is set to revolutionize studies of intracluster light by imaging the entire
southern sky down to a limiting surface brightness $\mu \gtrsim
30\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2$ by year ten. In this letter, we create a
precursor LSST dataset (reaching the equivalent of year eight depth) using
DECam observations of Abell 3667 and study its intracluster light. We have
discovered a low surface brightness ($ \mu \gtrsim 26\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2
$) optical bridge extending over $\sim 400\text{ kpc}$ which connects the two
brightest galaxies (BCG1 and BCG2) in the cluster; the color and surface
brightness of the bridge is consistent with formation via a major merger. The
inner regions of BCG1 ($r < 200\text{ kpc}$) and BCG2 ($r < 50\text{ kpc}$) are
consistent with formation via gradual stripping of satellite galaxies, but
BCG2's outer profile appears disrupted by a recent merger. We hypothesize that
the bridge is a relic of a recent first-pass between the two brightest galaxies
and is composed of stars being stripped from BCG2. Future studies of
intracluster light with LSST will discover new features such as the bridge in
local clusters while enabling detailed studies of the stellar populations of
these features with its six photometric bands.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23106v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neural Interpretable PDEs: Harmonizing Fourier Insights with Attention
  for Scalable and Interpretable Physics Discovery</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ning Liu, Yue Yu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.NA, math.NA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains
such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely
untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a
compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators
that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs --
a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this
work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator
architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO)
in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear
attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable
kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space.
As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store
large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling
spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across
diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable,
and efficient physics learning. Our code and data accompanying this paper are

  Reinforcement Learning in Multimodal Small Language Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zeyu Liu, Yuhang Liu, Guanghao Zhu, Congkai Xie, Zhen Li, Jianbo Yuan, Xinyao Wang, Qing Li, Shing-Chi Cheung, Shengyu Zhang, Fei Wu, Hongxia Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI, cs.CL</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which
leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning
significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision
test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on
MathVista testmini).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23369v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamic Spectral Backpropagation for Efficient Neural Network Training</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mannmohan Muthuraman</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dynamic Spectral Backpropagation (DSBP) enhances neural network training

  Star Formation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Meng-Yuan Ho, Ke-Jung Chen, Pei-Cheng Tung</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to the AAS Journals</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15
minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at
redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations
incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from
the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required
resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the
resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas
and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\
\text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion
during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong
turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark
matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach
numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic
turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense
clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse
into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a
common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy
star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function
of the first stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22997v1" target="_blank"><h2>Theoretical Foundations of the Deep Copula Classifier: A Generative
  Approach to Modeling Dependent Features</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Agnideep Aich, Ashit Baran Aich, Bruce Wade</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG, 62H30, 68T07, 62C12, 62G05</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly
simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where
real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC),
a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal
distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural
network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are
used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC
particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.
We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard
conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for
r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several
practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and
factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy
regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By
unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks,
DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for
dependency-aware classification.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23320v1" target="_blank"><h2>Efficient Parameter Estimation for Bayesian Network Classifiers using
  Hierarchical Linear Smoothing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Connor Cooper, Geoffrey I. Webb, Daniel F. Schmidt</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 9 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable
for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and
offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have
historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods
such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using
hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve
performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these
techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized
sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter
estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of
HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to
interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our
experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being
orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on
categorical data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23569v1" target="_blank"><h2>Maximum Likelihood Learning of Latent Dynamics Without Reconstruction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Samo Hromadka, Kai Biegun, Lior Fox, James Heald, Maneesh Sahani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with
latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space
model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian
Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at
different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the
flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive
approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum
likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an
explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus
model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and
expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent
prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural
network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the
RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary
losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms
alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics
from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the
RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23032v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bayesian Neural Scaling Laws Extrapolation with Prior-Fitted Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dongwoo Lee, Dong Bok Lee, Steven Adriaensen, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang, Frank Hutter, Seon Joo Kim, Hae Beom Lee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to ICML 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning.
Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the
power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the
scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on
point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for
real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining
the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional
computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on
Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation.
Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of
infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws,
allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness
of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both
the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such
as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable,
uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23614v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inference-time Scaling of Diffusion Models through Classical Search</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xiangcheng Zhang, Haowei Lin, Haotian Ye, James Zou, Jianzhu Ma, Yitao Liang, Yilun Du</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Website atthis https URL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial

framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the
generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed
Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using
breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range
of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and
image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both
performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a

(SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel

policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and
efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces
both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function

(TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot
forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot
consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot
downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs
for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the
pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in
computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant
network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve
this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to
regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant
and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six
benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly
improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This
"prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23706v1" target="_blank"><h2>Distributed Federated Learning for Vehicular Network Security: Anomaly

classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous
behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data
collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale,
high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle
networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed
Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning
models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating
models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi)
Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification
accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data.
Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains
through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network.
We further show that local training data size and time-varying network
connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We
investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple
domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our
results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when
confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust

  Shift</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sabina J. Sloman, Michele Caprio, Samuel Kaski</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic
uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify
the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings
introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the
basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple
tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the
source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an
accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce
a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic,
decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i)
consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of
epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each
of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries
of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the
settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within
$\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization
bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and
validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.</p></br></body>
