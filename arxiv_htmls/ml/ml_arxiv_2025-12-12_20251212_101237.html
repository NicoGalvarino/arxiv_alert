Our attention is therefore usually focused beyond Earth, home to the only form of life known today. However, how can we continue to explore the secrets of the Universe, if we stand by and watch our only home burn? We know that there is no Planet B. It is therefore urgent that, as astronomers, we collectively work to protect the Earth, allowing future generations the opportunity to continue to uncover the secrets of the cosmos. As astronomical facilities account for the majority of our community's carbon footprint, we propose guidelines that we hold crucial for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) to consider in the context of the Expanding Horizons programme as it plans a next-generation, transformational facility.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10763v1" target="_blank"><h2>Applying the BF method on the DESI evidence for dynamical dark energy models <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ziad Sakr<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> pre-submission version - comments and request for missing references are welcomed<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the DESI, when combined with CMB data and Type Ia supernovae observations, indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy when considering the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, over the standard ΛCDM or the wCDM model. However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10530v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological and lunar laser ranging constraints on evolving dark energy in a nonminimally coupled curvature-matter gravity model <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Riccardo March, Miguel Barroso Varela, Orfeu Bertolami, Giada Bargiacchi, Marco Muccino, Simone Dell'Agnello<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10417v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Systematic Study of Magnetic Fields Impacts on Neutrino Transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yudong Luo, Shuai Zha, Toshitaka Kajino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 7 figures, accepted by Phy. Rev. D<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We quantify the impact of strong magnetic fields (assuming $B=B_0\cdot r_0^3/r^3$ with $B_0\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G) on the neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\barν_e$ mean energy $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\mathcal{L_ν}$ for both $ν_e$ and $\barν_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\barν_e$ emission while suppressing that of $ν_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L_{ν_e}$ by increasing both $\mathcal{L}_{ν_e}$ and $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ whereas for $\barν_e$, the rise in $\mathcal{L}_{\barν_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L_{\barν_e}$. A systematic parameter scan of dipole field configurations suggests that, for $r_0 > 30$ km, $\langle E_{\barν_e} \rangle$ is significantly suppressed and $L_{ν_e}$ is enhanced if $B_0 \geq {2.7} \times 10^{16}$ G. These magnetic effects become negligible for $B_0$ below $\sim {7.4} \times 10^{15}$ G.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10222v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Phase-Space and Field-Level Cosmology: The Strength of Semi-Analytic Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Natalí S.

They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $Ω_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10130v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AURORA Survey: Constraining Chemical Enrichment Pathways at Cosmic Noon with Argon Abundances</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jack Foley, Alice Shapley, Ryan Sanders, Naveen A.

Although argon is an $α-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $α-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10023v1" target="_blank"><h2>Classification of a New X-ray Catalog of Likely Counterparts to 4FGL-DR4 Unassociated Gamma-ray Sources Using a Neural Network</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kyle D.

We present a catalog of 218 singlet and 70 multiplet $\mathit{Swift}$ X-ray sources detected within the positional uncertainty ellipses of 244 unassociated $\mathit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray sources from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 144 of which are not previously cataloged by Kerby et al.

We use these parameters as inputs for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier (NNC) trained to classify sources as blazars, pulsars, or ambiguous gamma-ray sources. For the 213 singlet sources with X-ray and optical data, we classify 173 as likely blazars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$) and 6 as likely pulsars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$), with 34 sources yielding ambiguous results. Including 70 multiplet X-ray sources, we increase the number of $P_\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$ to 227 and $P_\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$ to 16.

While effective, this method becomes inefficient when analysing large volumes of long time-series data and often relies on subjective stopping criteria to determine the number of iterations. We aim to perform frequency extraction of gravity modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars using a statistically robust, data-driven approach based on advanced power spectrum and harmonic analysis techniques. Our approach employs the multitaper non-uniform fast Fourier transform, mtNUFFT, a power spectrum estimator that addresses several statistical limitations of traditional methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We apply its extension, the multitaper F-test, to extract coherent gravity modes from 4-year Kepler light curves of SPB stars and to search for period spacing patterns among the extracted modes. The multitaper F-test enables fast and accurate extraction of the properties of gravity modes with quasi-infinite lifetimes, preferentially selecting modes that exhibit purely periodic behaviour. Although the method typically extracts fewer frequencies than conventional prewhitening, it recovers most known modes and, in some cases, reveals new ones. We also find evidence for gravity modes with long but finite lifetimes, and detect more than one period spacing pattern in some of the studied SPB stars. Overall, the multitaper F-test offers a more objective and statistically sound alternative to prewhitening. It scales efficiently to large datasets containing thousands of pulsators, and has the potential to facilitate mode identification and to distinguish between the different excitation mechanisms operating in SPB stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10014v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation of circumstellar material during double-white-dwarf mergers and the early excess emissions in Type Ia supernovae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yusuke Inoue, Keiichi Maeda, Takashi Nagao, Tatsuya Matsumoto<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to The Astrophysical Journal<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Early excess emission observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within $\sim1$ day of explosion provides a critical window into their progenitor systems. In the present study, we investigate formation of the circumstellar matter (CSM) in double white-dwarf (WD) mergers. We further study the interaction between the CSM and the SN ejecta. We first model the orbital evolution and super-Eddington mass transfer/ejection in the double WD systems. We then conduct hydrodynamical and light-curve (LC) simulations of the SN-CSM interaction, assuming a prompt SN Ia explosion in a context of the carbon-ignited violent merger (C-ignited VM). Our simulations show that at the moment of the merger, the binary system has the CSM distribution following $ρ_{\mathrm{CSM}}\simeq D(r/10^{14}\ \mathrm{cm})^{-3.5}\ (D\simeq 10^{-14}\text{--}10^{-13}\ \rm g\ cm^{-3})$. The simulated LCs reproduce the early flux excesses across optical to UV bands, as well as their color evolution, observed in the VM candidates, i.e., 03fg/02es-like SNe Ia. This supports that 03fg/02es-like objects originate from the VM explosions. We also discuss the case of the helium-ignited VM, which might be realized in some WD-WD mergers depending on the He content in the system. Focused here is the timing when the explosion is initiated, and we find that the explosion is initiated after the companion WD is, at least partially, tidally disrupted also in this case; we thus expect the formation of the CSM through the mass transfer phase also for the helium-ignited VM scenario.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10002v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Space-Based Time-Domain Revolution in Astrophysics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daniel Huber<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 34 pages (excluding references), 12 figures; to appear in Volume 64 of Annual Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract), time-domain (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Space-based time-domain telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler/K2 and TESS have profoundly impacted astrophysics over the past two decades.

In addition to revolutionizing exoplanet science, the data have enabled breakthroughs ranging from the solar system to stellar interiors, the transient universe, and active galaxies. The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of "dark" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars. (3) Early-time observations of explosive transients provide new insights into the progenitors of supernovae, while the quasi-periodic variability of galaxies probes the physics of accretion processes onto supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. (4) Observations of solar system objects reveal asteroid compositions through their rotation periods and amplitudes, constrain the cloud structure of ice giants, and allow the discovery of new objects in the outer solar system.

To construct the Roman SN Hubble diagram, a strategy to obtain redshifts must be determined. While the nominal HLTDS will use only the Roman prism, in this work we consider the utility of the Roman grism observations from overlap with the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey for SNIa cosmology. We determine a galaxy grism redshift recovery rate by simulating dispersed grism images and measuring redshifts with the Grizli software, obtaining an $H$-band 50% redshift recovery at magnitude 20.61 and 90% recovery at magnitude 19.27. To estimate the total number of spectroscopic redshifts expected for Roman SN cosmology, we also consider a Roman prism SN redshift efficiency and a ground-based telescope redshift efficiency for host-galaxies. We apply these redshift efficiencies to SNIa catalog level simulations and predict that $\sim$6800 SNe will have a SN or host spectroscopic redshift. Second, we evaluate the size of potential systematics related to modeling the grism redshift efficiency by considering the impact of additional dependencies on stellar mass and host galaxy color. We estimate the largest potential size of this systematic to be 0.0066$\pm$0.002 and -0.0266$\pm$0.007, roughly 42.9 and 49.6% of the statistical uncertainty for $w_0$ and $w_a$ respectively.

When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\pm0.36{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $Λ$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09989v1" target="_blank"><h2>ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eric Putney, David Shih, Sung Hak Lim, Matthew R.

The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems.

In this paper we take advantage of HST's multi-wavelength coverage (F475W, F606W and F814W observations) with the addition of deep u-band imaging from Gran Telescopio de Canarias, to perform the most detailed study and estimation to date of the GC population of the ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-2019. The improved constraints provided by the combination of high spatial resolution and better coverage of the GC spectral energy distribution has allowed us to obtain a clean sample of GCs in this galaxy. We report a number of 33+-3 GCs in MATLAS-2019, supporting the previous lower estimates for this galaxy. The GC population of this galaxy is highly concentrated with ~80% of the GCs inside the effective radius (Re) of the galaxy and the GC half-number radius Re,GC is 0.7Re. Using the GC-Halo mass relation, we estimate a halo mass for MATLAS-2019 of (1.14+-0.1)x10**11 solar masses. The GC luminosity function and the distribution of effective radii of the GCs favour a distance to the galaxy of 20.0+-0.9 Mpc. In agreement with previous findings, we find that the distribution of GCs is highly asymmetric even though the distribution of stars in the galaxy is symmetric. This suggests that assumptions about the symmetry of the GC distribution may be incorrect when used to calculate the number of GCs with such low statistics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09981v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rhea-RT: Dynamical impact of Central Molecular Zone conditions on ISM properties and stellar feedback coupling</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\rm cell}=20$ M$_\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09984v1" target="_blank"><h2>Clues from $\mathcal{Q}$--A null test designed for line intensity mapping cross-correlation studies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Debanjan Sarkar, Ella Iles, Adrian Liu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 27 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables.

Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09878v1" target="_blank"><h2>GFH-v2 Pipeline for Searches of Long-Transient Gravitational Waves from Newborn Magnetars <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sandhya Sajith Menon, Lorenzo Pierini, Pia Astone, Cristiano Palomba, Lorenzo Silvestri, Sabrina D'Antonio, Simone Dall'Osso, Francesco Safai Tehrani, Stefano Dal Pra, Gaetano Dinatale, Sergio Frasca, Dafne Guetta, Paola Leaci, Alessio Orlandi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 10 figures ( +1 figure in appendix)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper presents an enhanced methodology for searching long transient gravitational waves associated with a newborn magnetar using a strongly improved version of the generalized Frequency Hough Transform algorithm, called GFH-v2.

On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($Δ_{\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 > -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $Λ$CDM scenario, based on both $Δχ^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 18 papers (13 new, 5 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
