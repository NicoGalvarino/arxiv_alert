social media users in an innovative multimodal way. We integrate Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) together. Firstly,
we apply NLP on the user-generated text and conduct semantic analysis,
sentiment recognition and keyword extraction to get subtle risk signals from
social media posts. Meanwhile, we build a heterogeneous user relationship graph
based on social interaction and propose a novel relational graph convolutional
network to model user relationship, attention relationship and content
dissemination path to discover some important structural information and user
behaviors. Finally, we combine textual features extracted from these two models
above with graph structural information, which provides a more robust and
effective way to discover at-risk users. Our experiments on real social media
datasets from different platforms show that our model can achieve significant
improvement over single-modality methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17784v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revealing Multimodal Causality with Large Language Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jin Li, Shoujin Wang, Qi Zhang, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Longbing Cao, Shui Yu, Fang Chen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract), causality (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Uncovering cause-and-effect mechanisms from data is fundamental to scientific
progress. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal
discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly
prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent
of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two
primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal
interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2)
insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data.
To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for
multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key
components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine
multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample
pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal
relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal
counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by
incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships
among them from multimodal unstructured data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17752v1" target="_blank"><h2>GEM-T: Generative Tabular Data via Fitting Moments</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Miao Li, Phuc Nguyen, Christopher Tam, Alexandra Morgan, Kenneth Ge, Rahul Bansal, Linzi Yu, Rima Arnaout, Ramy Arnaout</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Tabular data dominates data science but poses challenges for generative
models, especially when the data is limited or sensitive. We present a novel
approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum
entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for
tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise,
third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing,
GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as
state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse
subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer
trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world
data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations,
provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore,
MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs.
categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data.
GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance
generative models for structured data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17472v1" target="_blank"><h2>Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jia Li, Shiyu Long, Ye Yuan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (abstract), neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in
various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However,
existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph

a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with
the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation
strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure
to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and

  Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiazhen Chen, Mingbin Feng, Tony S.

numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series
anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model
inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph
representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse
relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose
the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD.
PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with
a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph
cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function
promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable
long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we
introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of
traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with
unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately
reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby
enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to
existing TSAD techniques.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16395v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low-Rank Adaptation of Evolutionary Deep Neural Networks for Efficient
  Learning of Time-Dependent PDEs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiahao Zhang, Shiheng Zhang, Guang Lin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the Evolutionary Deep Neural Network (EDNN) framework for
accelerating numerical solvers of time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). We introduce a Low-Rank Evolutionary Deep Neural Network (LR-EDNN),
which constrains parameter evolution to a low-rank subspace, thereby reducing
the effective dimensionality of training while preserving solution accuracy.
The low-rank tangent subspace is defined layer-wise by the singular value
decomposition (SVD) of the current network weights, and the resulting update is
obtained by solving a well-posed, tractable linear system within this subspace.
This design augments the underlying numerical solver with a parameter efficient
EDNN component without requiring full fine-tuning of all network weights. We
evaluate LR-EDNN on representative PDE problems and compare it against
corresponding baselines. Across cases, LR-EDNN achieves comparable accuracy
with substantially fewer trainable parameters and reduced computational cost.
These results indicate that low-rank constraints on parameter velocities,
rather than full-space updates, provide a practical path toward scalable,
efficient, and reproducible scientific machine learning for PDEs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16699v1" target="_blank"><h2>Knowledge Distillation for Variational Quantum Convolutional Neural

heterogeneous client data and variations in local model structures, which
hinder global model aggregation. To address these challenges, we propose a
knowledge distillation framework for variational quantum convolutional neural
networks on heterogeneous data. The framework features a quantum gate number
estimation mechanism based on client data, which guides the construction of
resource-adaptive VQCNN circuits. Particle swarm optimization is employed to
efficiently generate personalized quantum models tailored to local data
characteristics. During aggregation, a knowledge distillation strategy
integrating both soft-label and hard-label supervision consolidates knowledge
from heterogeneous clients using a public dataset, forming a global model while
avoiding parameter exposure and privacy leakage. Theoretical analysis shows
that proposed framework benefits from quantum high-dimensional representation,
offering advantages over classical approaches, and minimizes communication by
exchanging only model indices and test outputs. Extensive simulations on the
PennyLane platform validate the effectiveness of the gate number estimation and
distillation-based aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that the
aggregated global model achieves accuracy close to fully supervised centralized
training. These results shown that proposed methods can effectively handle
heterogeneity, reduce resource consumption, and maintain performance,
highlighting its potential for scalable and privacy-preserving distributed
quantum learning.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17943v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can multimodal representation learning by alignment preserve

has motivated self-supervised learning techniques. State-of-the-art multimodal
representation learning techniques leverage the spatial alignment between
satellite data from different modalities acquired over the same geographic area
in order to foster a semantic alignment in the latent space. In this paper, we
investigate how this methods can preserve task-relevant information that is not
shared across modalities. First, we show, under simplifying assumptions, when
alignment strategies fundamentally lead to an information loss. Then, we
support our theoretical insight through numerical experiments in more realistic

generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user
confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We
propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a
multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty
measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed
task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the
input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and
sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only
input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth
(unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf
multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA
uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative
improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in
selective prediction performance, based on

modern applications, such as predicting the remaining discharge time and

face several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of
parameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still
depend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we
propose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for
battery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.
SeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the
proposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging
adaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit
model (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together
with the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic
battery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves
robust performance. Extensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets (TRI,
RT-Batt, and NASA) demonstrate that SeqBattNet significantly outperforms
classical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving consistently lower RMSE
while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17670v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tailored Transformation Invariance for Industrial Anomaly Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mariette Schönfeld, Wannes Meert, Hendrik Blockeel</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract), attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is a subproblem within Computer Vision
Anomaly Detection that has been receiving increasing amounts of attention due
to its applicability to real-life scenarios. Recent research has focused on how
to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods
that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive
to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of
related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that
popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this
idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a
middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no
translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change
increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and
test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based
approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed
by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of
requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of
interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks,
for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline. Our code can be

targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to
perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target
sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a
false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to
the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial
perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting
the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets

spatial audio systems, and acoustic localization. However, existing methods
often struggle to address nonlinear clock drift and lack mechanisms for
quantifying uncertainty. Traditional methods like Cross-correlation and Dynamic
Time Warping assume simple drift patterns and provide no reliability measures.
Meanwhile, recent deep learning models typically treat alignment as a binary
classification task, overlooking inter-channel dependencies and uncertainty
estimation. We introduce a method that combines cross-attention mechanisms with
confidence-weighted scoring to improve multi-channel audio synchronization. We
extend BEATs encoders with cross-attention layers to model temporal
relationships between channels. We also develop a confidence-weighted scoring
function that uses the full prediction distribution instead of binary
thresholding. Our method achieved first place in the BioDCASE 2025 Task 1
challenge with 0.30 MSE average across test datasets, compared to 0.58 for the
deep learning baseline. On individual datasets, we achieved 0.14 MSE on ARU
data (77% reduction) and 0.45 MSE on zebra finch data (18% reduction). The
framework supports probabilistic temporal alignment, moving beyond point
estimates. While validated in a bioacoustic context, the approach is applicable
to a broader range of multi-channel audio tasks where alignment confidence is
critical. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/BEATsCA</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16625v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-Supervised Learning of Graph Representations for Network Intrusion

under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent
works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection,
they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting
the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a
self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by
learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a
masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its
local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a
Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly
learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring
explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high
reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end
framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream
task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow
benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score,

Ignoring NDS can lead models to misclassify shifted normal instances as
anomalies, degrading detection performance. To tackle this issue, we propose
WhENDS, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that aligns normal edge
embeddings across time by estimating distributional statistics and applying
whitening transformations. Extensive experiments on four widely-used dynamic

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a
Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM. PCA is
employed to reduce dimensionality and stabilize data variance, while Poisson
Regression effectively models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM

positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand
predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data
with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation,
we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure
over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using
generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in
hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a
hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal
graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields
causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into
their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism.
Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings
possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal
distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and
robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and
real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and
effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

While deep learning models are widely used for English ABSA, their application
in Arabic is limited due to the scarcity of labeled data. Researchers have
attempted to tackle this issue by using pre-trained contextualized language
models such as BERT. However, these models are often based on fact-based data,
which can introduce bias in domain-specific tasks like ABSA. To our knowledge,
no studies have applied adaptive pre-training with Arabic contextualized models
for ABSA. This research proposes a novel approach using domain-adaptive
pre-training for aspect-sentiment classification (ASC) and opinion target
expression (OTE) extraction. We examine fine-tuning strategies - feature
extraction, full fine-tuning, and adapter-based methods - to enhance
performance and efficiency, utilizing multiple adaptation corpora and
contextualized models. Our results show that in-domain adaptive pre-training
yields modest improvements. Adapter-based fine-tuning is a computationally
efficient method that achieves competitive results. However, error analyses
reveal issues with model predictions and dataset labeling. In ASC, common
problems include incorrect sentiment labeling, misinterpretation of contrastive
markers, positivity bias for early terms, and challenges with conflicting
opinions and subword tokenization. For OTE, issues involve mislabeling targets,
confusion over syntactic roles, difficulty with multi-word expressions, and
reliance on shallow heuristics. These findings underscore the need for syntax-
and semantics-aware models, such as graph convolutional networks, to more
effectively capture long-distance relations and complex aspect-based opinion

  Dimensionality</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dominic Broadbent, Nick Whiteley, Robert Allison, Tom Lovett</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.ME</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 43 pages, 20 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> latent space (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but
modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We
propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that
compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with
overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension.
Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy
between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional
latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using
the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with
the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD,
guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original
distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can
achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at
substantially lower cost.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17153v1" target="_blank"><h2>Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Moule Lin, Andrea Patane, Weipeng Jing, Shuhao Guan, Goetz Botterweck</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes (FiD-GP), a compression
framework that incorporates a compact inducing weight matrix to project a
neural network's weight uncertainty into a lower-dimensional subspace.
Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral
regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace
with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection
mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework
in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution
(OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation
ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight
spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and
significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost
of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights
employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression,
image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection
benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude,
compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and
matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16547v1" target="_blank"><h2>Checking extracted rules in Neural Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Adrian Wurm</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, one figure</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this paper we investigate formal verification of extracted rules for
Neural Networks under a complexity theoretic point of view. A rule is a global
property or a pattern concerning a large portion of the input space of a
network. These rules are algorithmically extracted from networks in an effort
to better understand their inner way of working. Here, three problems will be
in the focus: Does a given set of rules apply to a given network? Is a given
set of rules consistent or do the rules contradict themselves? Is a given set
of rules exhaustive in the sense that for every input the output is determined?
Finding algorithms that extract such rules out of networks has been
investigated over the last 30 years, however, to the author's current
knowledge, no attempt in verification was made until now. A lot of attempts of
extracting rules use heuristics involving randomness and over-approximation, so
it might be beneficial to know whether knowledge obtained in that way can
actually be trusted.
  We investigate the above questions for neural networks with ReLU-activation
as well as for Boolean networks, each for several types of rules. We
demonstrate how these problems can be reduced to each other and show that most
of them are co-NP-complete.</p></br></body>
