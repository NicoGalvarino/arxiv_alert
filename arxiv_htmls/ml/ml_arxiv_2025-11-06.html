the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102
spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to
130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 -
19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after
mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will
produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain
the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce
two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping
to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of
infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will
comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other
biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly
released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release
specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed.
The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on
planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3
years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft,
which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial
evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02634v1" target="_blank"><h2>Using Deep Learning for Robust Classification of Fast Radio Bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rohan Arni, Carlos Blanco, Anirudh Prabhu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables. Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> variational autoencoder (abstract), VAE (abstract), latent space (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> While the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unknown,
population-level analyses can elucidate underlying structure in these signals.
In this study, we employ deep learning methods to both classify FRBs and
analyze structural patterns in the latent space learned from the first CHIME
catalog. We adopt a Supervised Variational Autoencoder (sVAE) architecture
which combines the representational learning capabilities of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) with a supervised classification task, thereby improving
both classification performance and the interpretability of the latent space.
We construct a learned latent space in which we perform further dimensionality
reduction to find underlying structure in the data. Our results demonstrate
that the sVAE model achieves high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters and
reveals separation between repeater and non-repeater populations. Upon further
analysis of the latent space, we observe that dispersion measure excess,
spectral index, and spectral running are the dominant features distinguishing
repeaters from non-repeaters. We also identify four non-repeating FRBs as
repeater candidates, two of which have been independently flagged in previous
studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03663v1" target="_blank"><h2>3D Full Spectrum Fitting: Algorithm Comparison</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Prashin Jethwa, Simon Hubmer, Ronny Ramlau, Glenn Van de Ven</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Full spectrum fitting is the prevailing method for extracting stellar
kinematic and population measurements from 1D galaxy spectra. 3D methods refer
to analysis of Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data where spatial and
spectral dimensions are modelled simultaneously. While several 3D methods exist
for modelling gas structures there has been less investigation into the more
computationally demanding problem of 3D full spectrum fitting for stellar
recoveries. This work introduces and compares two algorithms for this task: the
Projected Nesterov Kaczmarz Reconstruction method (PNKR) and a version of the
Bayes-LOSVD software which has been modified to account for spatial
correlations. We aim to understand strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms
and assess the impact of 3D methods for stellar inferences. We apply both
recovery algorithms to a mock IFS data over a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range
from 20-200 and evaluate the quality of the recoveries compared to the known
ground truth. Accounting for spatial correlations in Bayes-LOSVD significantly
improved the accuracy and precision of kinematic recoveries. 3D modelling with
PNKR did not provide any significant improvement over 1D fits however, for
SNR>40, PNKR did recover the most accurate kinematics overall. Additionally, by
modelling the joint distribution over kinematics and populations, PNKR could
successfully infer trends between these quantities e.g. inferring local
metallicity-velocity trends, albeit with a significant bias on the absolute
metallicity. Having demonstrated advantages of (i) 3D modelling with
Bayes-LOSVD, and (ii) joint kinematic-population analyses with PNKR, we
conclude that both methodological advances will prove useful for detecting and
characterising stellar structures from IFS data.</p></br></body>
