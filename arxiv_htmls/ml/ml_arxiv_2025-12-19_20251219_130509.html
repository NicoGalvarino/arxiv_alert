In this work, we employ a model-independent approach to jointly reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_ν$, adopting the PCHIP method with seven fixed nodes in which we allow the two parameters to vary. We employ CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Supernovae Ia data to constrain the values of $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and $\sum m_ν$ at each node. We conduct three different analyses in which we reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$: one with fixed $\sum m_ν=0.06~\mathrm{eV}$; one in which we allow $\sum m_ν$ to vary, and one in which we also reconstruct $\sum m_ν$ using the PCHIP method. We find the dark energy equation of state to be consistent with the cosmological constant scenario, except when including DESI data and allowing for phantom crossing, where we find a $95\%$ CL deviation from $w_\mathrm{DE}=-1$ around $z\sim1.2$. For neutrino masses, we obtain looser constraints when focusing on phantom dark energy, that show further early and late relaxation when reconstructing the mass via the PCHIP method.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16753v1" target="_blank"><h2>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Danielle Frostig, Nathan Lourie, Viraj Karambelkar, Mansi M.

The project takes advantage of the recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for near-infrared photometry without cryogenic cooling. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a >1 degree-squared field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16709v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting - III Deriving exact posteriors with dimension reduction and importance sampling</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Didier Barret, Simon Dupourqué<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A, Abstract abridged for ArXiv<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dimension reduction (title), latent space (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Simulation-based inference (SBI) with neural posterior estimation (NPE) provides rapid X-ray spectral fitting in both Gaussian and Poisson regimes by learning approximate parameter posteriors from simulations. We investigate auto-encoders for compressing high-resolution X-ray spectra, motivated by newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), and use likelihood-based importance sampling to refine NPE outputs. Our auto-encoder maps spectra to a low-dimensional latent space and is trained with a custom loss equal to the Cash statistic (C-stat) between simulated and reconstructed spectra. A neural density estimator is then trained on the latent representations. Both models are trained in multiple rounds: at each round, new simulations are drawn from a truncated proposal concentrated around the observation, improving efficiency as the proposal contracts. After NPE convergence, we apply likelihood-based importance sampling to correct the learned posterior. To assess information retention, we train a diagnostic network that predicts the original spectral parameters from the latent space, and we also train a network to learn the likelihood directly to accelerate importance sampling. On X-IFU-like simulations, the auto-encoder and multi-round NPE outperforms PCA and hand-crafted spectral summaries in accuracy and robustness. After importance sampling, the resulting posteriors are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with nested sampling. On a standard laptop, the full pipeline (simulation, compression, inference, correction) delivers 10x speedups. We further demonstrate the approach on XRISM/Resolve and on lower-resolution NICER and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data, confirming applicability across instruments and resolutions. Overall, NPE on compressed spectra paired with likelihood-based importance sampling offers an exact yet efficient alternative for Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16591v1" target="_blank"><h2>An effective $\boldsymbolΛ$-Szekeres modelling of the local Universe with Cosmicflows-4</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marco Galoppo, Leonardo Giani, Morag Hills, Aurélien Valade<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 8 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We develop an effective description of the local cosmic environment, namely, for redshift $z \lesssim 0.1$, to quantify the bias induced by local structure on cosmological observables.

With this generalized relaxation time, the non-linear IS equation simplifies to a first-order non-linear expression connecting bulk viscous pressure and energy density, which remains valid in any homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. In the case of spatially flat Friedmann universe, adopting this extended relation in the generalized non-linear IS theory, provides new class of analytical solutions in both, the linear, and the non-linear regimes. We also find that, the resulting effective equation of state in the linear regime naturally reproduces the generalized polytropic form which is often introduced phenomenologically in literature. Resulting dynamical implications are investigated and the constraints necessary for ensuring an acceptable evolutionary behavior for the fluid are determined. A detailed dynamical system analysis of the coupled Einstein-Israel-Stewart (EIS) system is also performed. Finally, we solve the coupled EIS equations numerically, and show that the model can support a transient Hubble slow-roll expansion phase with a smooth exit to a radiation-dominated universe, which is challenging to obtain in standard inflationary models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16478v1" target="_blank"><h2>Uniform Rolling: An LSST Observing Cadence Offering Sufficient Survey Uniformity for Comprehensive Cosmological Analysis <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Boris Leistedt, Matthew R.

Rubin Observatory promises to be the defining survey of the next decade, supplying unprecedented access to the night sky to static science- and time-domain science-focused researchers alike. Maximizing the output of the broad remit of Rubin Observatory science requires a non-trivial survey strategy. For time-domain science, the most promising strategy designed so far is a rolling survey strategy, whereby a subset of the full LSST survey area is observed at higher rate compared with the nominal rate dictated by weather conditions and the observatory's technical constraints. This strategy is now the baseline approach for the LSST as a whole. Focusing on static science (galaxy clustering and weak lensing), we study how these time-domain-optimized rolling strategies affect the depth uniformity at intermediate years of the survey. We characterize the amount of survey area at high risk of being lost in static-science analyses of a baseline rolling LSST dataset due to an insufficient combination of survey contiguity and uniformity. At intermediate data releases, nearly half of the survey could be lost for static science, decreasing the Dark Energy figure of merit by approximately 40\%. We describe additional metrics focused on key analysis tasks, such as photometric redshifts and galaxy clustering. We propose a new strategy that returns the survey to uniformity at key release years, enabling use of the full survey area and restoring our metrics to the values they would have in a non-rolling cadence without loss of time domain data relative to a rolling survey with the same number of rolling cycles. This work has informed the third round of optimization of the survey strategy, and the new uniform rolling strategies have been incorporated into the baseline strategy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16375v1" target="_blank"><h2>High mass accretion rates onto evolved stripped-envelope massive stars by jet-induced mass removal</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yotham Cohen, Ealeal Bear, Noam Soker<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> It will be submitted in two days to allow for comments (including missing references)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Simulating one-dimensional stellar evolution models with MESA, we show that removing the outer inflated envelope of a mass-accreting evolved stripped-envelope star, like a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, substantially moderates the stellar expansion during accretion at high-mass accretion rates. We study the accretion onto a star via an accretion disk, which launches jets that remove the high-entropy outer layers of the inflated envelope. This is the `jetted mass removal accretion scenario.' By manually removing the entire hydrogen-rich envelope from a red supergiant, we build a hydrogen-deficient WR stellar model with a mass of 6.03Mo and a radius of 0.67Ro. We then accrete mass onto it at a high rate. We mimic the real process of simultaneous mass addition near the equatorial plane and jet-induced mass removal from the outer envelope by dividing the accretion period into hundreds of pulses: in the first half of each pulse, we add mass, and in the second, we remove a fraction of this mass. The removal of tens of percent from the added mass decreases the stellar expansion by a factor of about 2-5. Our results show that WR stars can maintain a deep potential well and not expand much while accreting mass at high rates. This allows the formation of an accretion disk and the liberation of large amounts of gravitational energy. Our results strengthen models of intermediate-luminosity optical transients, such as luminous red novae, in which a non-degenerate star accretes at high rates and launches jets that power the transient event.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16316v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hydrodynamic Evolution and Detectability of Nova Remnants in the Galactic Center</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhao Su, Zhiyuan Li<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 11 figures, accepted by MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$α$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\%, 8\%, and 18\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$α$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16264v1" target="_blank"><h2>Expanding Horizons - Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s Time-Domain Multi-Messenger Astronomy in the 2040s: EM Follow-up of LGWA Sources</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) concept is designed to probe this gap, enabling continuous observation of compact binaries over months to years prior to coalescence, and detecting sources inaccessible to both space-based mHz detectors and current ground-based >10 Hz facilities. This new GW window fundamentally alters the landscape of time-domain multi-messenger astronomy. Rather than reacting to mergers after the fact, LGWA enables predictive, scheduled electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, transforming how compact-object mergers, their environments, and their astrophysical channels are studied. However, fully exploiting LGWA discoveries requires EM capabilities that do not exist today and are unlikely to be available by the 2030s, particularly for wide-area, rapid, spectroscopically rich follow-up at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This White Paper identifies the key science cases enabled by LGWA that motivate new ground-based capabilities in the 2040s.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16130v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unraveling the anomaly in the production of $^{60}$Fe nucleus in massive stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Samapti Lakshan, Le Tan Phuc, Deepak Pandit, Srijit Bhattacharya, Le Thi Quynh Huong, Nguyen Dinh Dang, Balaram Dey, Nguyen Ngoc Anh, Nguyen Quang Hung<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> nucl-th, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The production of $^{60}$Fe is crucial for nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. In this work, by using the microscopic EP+IPM (exact pairing plus the independent-particle model) for the nuclear level density (NLD) and extended EP+PDM (exact pairing plus phonon damping model) for the $γ$-ray strength function (gSF), we re-evaluate the substantial enhancement of $^{60}$Fe production recently reported in {\it A. Spyrou et al., Nat. Comm. {\bf 15}, 9608 (2024)}, which was attributed to an unexpectedly large Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS). Our analysis demonstrates that this enhancement indeed originates from the choice of NLD, which, despite being constrained to reproduce the total NLD and gSF data, lacks a reliable spin dependence, a critical input for Hauser-Feshbach calculations of nuclear reaction rate. In contrast, our predictions yield a significantly lower MACS, calling the claimed enhancement into question. In particular, our approach highlights the microscopic nature of the low-energy enhancement of the gSF, the so-called upbend resonance, which arises from strong particle-particle ($pp$) and hole-hole ($hh$) excitations that emerge only at finite temperature, thereby further reinsisting on the invalidity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis in this low-energy region. Overall, our study reopens the question on the long-standing problem of $^{60}$Fe production in massive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16051v1" target="_blank"><h2>Graph Neural Networks for Interferometer Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sidharth Kannan, Pooyan Goodarzi, Evangelos E.

Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD). The presence of a DAO feature close to the BAO peak can be scrutinized with future full-shape galaxy clustering data from DESI and Euclid.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15615v1" target="_blank"><h2>Benchmarking Dimensionality Reduction Methods for High-Dimensional ALMA Image Cubes <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Haley N.

While some of these facilities will generate enormous photometric alert streams, the physical interpretation of variability and transients often requires spectroscopy, which encodes changes in ionisation state, kinematics, and accretion that are inaccessible to photometry alone. A critical gap is therefore emerging: next-generation surveys may produce up to $\sim10^9$ alerts per year, whereas global spectroscopic follow-up is limited to only $\sim10^4$--$10^5$ transient spectra annually. We present the concept of spectroscopic alerts: real-time notifications triggered by significant spectral evolution, enabling spectroscopy to act as a discovery channel rather than solely as follow-up. We outline the key science cases enabled by this capability and describe the instrumental and operational requirements of a wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility capable of delivering real-time spectral discovery for 2040s time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15821v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nova Explosions in 2040</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alessandro Ederoclite, Domitilla De Martino, Paul Groot, Elena Mason, Gloria Sala, Martín Guerrero, Thomas Kupfer, Anna Francesca Pala, Simone Scaringi, Noel Castro Segura<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 3 pages + title page.

Despite major progress driven by wide-field time-domain surveys and multi-wavelength facilities, our understanding of nova explosions remains limited by incomplete temporal coverage, heterogeneous spectroscopic follow-up, and poorly constrained ejecta properties. In this white paper we outline the open scientific questions that will define nova research in the 2040s, focusing on the mass, composition, geometry, and dynamics of the ejecta, the role of the underlying binary system, and the connection between nuclear burning, shocks, and emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. We argue that decisive progress requires rapid-response, high-cadence, multi-wavelength observations, anchored by systematic high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy from eruption to quiescence. Finally, we identify key technological requirements needed to enable transformative advances in the physics of nova explosions over the coming decades.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15266v1" target="_blank"><h2>BBNet: accurate neural network emulator for primordial light element abundances <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fan Zhang, Hang Diao, Bohua Li, Joel Meyers, Paul R.

However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15142v2" target="_blank"><h2>Robustness Analysis of USmorph: I. Generalization Efficiency of Unsupervised Strategies and Supervised Learning in Galaxy Morphological Classification <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shiwei Zhu, Guanwen Fang, Yao Dai, Chichun Zhou, Yirui Zheng, Jie Song, Shiying Lu, Xu Kong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Published in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 < z < 1.2$, $I_{\mathrm{mag}} < 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15137v2" target="_blank"><h2>An updated efficient galaxy morphology classification model based on ConvNeXt encoding with UMAP dimensionality reduction <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guanwen Fang, Shiwei Zhu, Jun Xu, Shiying Lu, Chichun Zhou, Yao Dai, Zesen Lin, Xu Kong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in AJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), dimensionality reduction (title, abstract), neural network (abstract), transfer learning (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an enhanced unsupervised machine learning (UML) module within our previous \texttt{USmorph} classification framework featuring two components: (1) hierarchical feature extraction via a pre-trained ConvNeXt convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning, and (2) nonlinear manifold learning using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for topology-aware dimensionality reduction. This dual-stage design enables efficient knowledge transfer from large-scale visual datasets while preserving morphological pattern geometry through UMAP's neighborhood preservation. We apply the upgraded UML on I-band images of 99,806 COSMOS galaxies at redshift $0.2<z<1.2$ (to ensure rest-frame optical morphology) with $I_{\mathrm{mag}}<25$. The predefined cluster number is optimized to 20 (reduced from 50 in the original framework), achieving significant computational savings. The 20 algorithmically identified clusters are merged into five physical morphology types. About 51\% of galaxies (50,056) were successfully classified. To assess classification effectiveness, we tested morphological parameters for massive galaxies with $M_{*}>10^{9}~M_{\odot}$. Our classification results align well with galaxy evolution theory. This improved algorithm significantly enhances galaxy morphology classification efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale sky surveys such as those planned with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15129v2" target="_blank"><h2>Dual-coding contrastive learning based on ConvNeXt and ViT models for morphological classification of galaxies in COSMOS-Web <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shiwei Zhu, Guanwen Fang, Chichun Zhou, Jie Song, Zesen Lin, Yao Dai, Xu Kong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Published in APJS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In our previous works, we proposed a machine learning framework named \texttt{USmorph} for efficiently classifying galaxy morphology. In this study, we propose a self-supervised method called contrastive learning to upgrade the unsupervised machine learning (UML) part of the \texttt{USmorph} framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of feature extraction in this step. The upgraded UML method primarily consists of the following three aspects. (1) We employ a Convolutional Autoencoder to denoise galaxy images and the Adaptive Polar Coordinate Transformation to enhance the model's rotational invariance. (2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features. (3) We adopt a Bagging-based clustering model to cluster galaxies with similar features into distinct groups. By carefully dividing the redshift bins, we apply this model to the rest-frame optical images of galaxies in the COSMOS-Web field within the redshift range of $0.5 < z < 6.0$. Compared to the previous algorithm, the improved UML method successfully classifies 73\% galaxies. Using the GoogleNet algorithm, we classify the morphology of the remaining 27\% galaxies. To validate the reliability of our updated algorithm, we compared our classification results with other galaxy morphological parameters and found a good consistency with galaxy evolution. Benefiting from its higher efficiency, this updated algorithm is well-suited for application in future China Space Station Telescope missions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15015v1" target="_blank"><h2>Irradiation-Driven Formation of Supersoft X-ray Sources Following Classical Novae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Weitao Zhao, Xiangcun Meng, Yingzhen Cui, Yunlang Guo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages,4 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are characterized by persistent thermonuclear burning on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs).The standard model requires high mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-7}\, {\rm M_{\odot}}\,yr^{-1}$ from massive companions, presenting a theoretical impediment to the observed short-period SSSs, whose orbital periods imply low-mass donors theoretically incapable of sustaining such accretion.To resolve this paradox,we propose and demonstrate through detailed simulations that irradiative feedback following a classical nova (CN) eruption provides a natural formation channel.Through detailed binary evolution simulations with MESA, we reveal that sustained WD irradiation initially from the outburst and subsequently from accretion luminosity triggers significant and stable expansion of the low mass companion.This,in turn,drives mass-transfer rates into the stable hydrogen-burning regime and sustains it beyond $10^4$ years after the initiation of hydrogen burning.This mechanism robustly explains the observed population of short-period SSSs. Moreover,when irradiation-driven mass transfer rate drops below the stable accretion rate,it may lead to the rapid accumulation of sufficient material on shorter time scales to trigger a recurrent nova outburst instead of SSS, thereby also offering an explanation for the origin of short-period recurrent novae.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15010v1" target="_blank"><h2>GRBs and Relativistic Transients in the 2040s <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nikhil Sarin, Andrew Levan, Nial Tanvir, Simone Scaringi, Fabio Ragosta, Andrea Melandri, Paul Groot, Paul O'Brien, Paul Lasky, Samaya Nissanke, Alexander Heger, Steve Schulze<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, White paper for the ESO expanding horizons call<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe. The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up. This white paper demonstrates that without a dedicated large-aperture (10-30 m effective collecting area) time-domain facility with robotic scheduling and optical-NIR spectroscopic capabilities, the transformative potential of relativistic transient science in the 2040s will be considerably limited.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14913v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey(GRAMS) experiment <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

MeV gamma-ray observations are important for understanding multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy, enabling exploration of the universe's most potent events, such as supernovae and neutron star mergers. Despite the significance of MeV gamma-rays, GRAMS could also explore the so-called 'MeV gap' region to improve MeV gamma-ray measurement sensitivity that was restricted by the challenge of accurately reconstructing Compton events. Aside from gamma-ray detection, the GRAMS proposed method also serves as an antiparticle spectrometer, targeting the low-energy range of cosmic antinuclei measurements.

However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14802v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical binary interactions in the 2040s <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nadejda Blagorodnova, Ondřej Pejcha, Tomek Kamiński, Yongzhi Cai, Kishalay De, Nancy Elias-Rosa, Jim Fuller, Hongwei Ge, David Jones, Stephen Justham, Viraj Karambelkar, Jakub Klencki, Elena Mason, Brian Metzger, Andrea Pastorello, Andrea Reguitti Friedrich Röpke, Steven Shore, Giorgio Valerin<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call for White Papers. 1 cover page and 3 pages of text<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dynamical binary interactions such as common envelope (CE) evolution or stellar mergers are a critical phase in the formation of a wide variety of binary phenomena, ranging from blue stragglers to type I supernovae (of all flavours, a, b and c), $γ$-ray bursts to bipolar planetary nebulae, Thorne-Zytkow objects to X-ray binaries. In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14800v1" target="_blank"><h2>White Dwarf Binaries: Probes of Future Astrophysics <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anna F.

They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14592v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV scale with the Pierre Auger Observatory <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eva dos Santos<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extensive air showers produced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays ($E > 10^{18}$ eV) in the Earth's atmosphere provide a challenging yet unique channel to probe hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV center-of-mass energy scale. Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory. With the advent of AugerPrime, we expect to deliver breakthrough results on the 100 TeV-scale hadronic interactions in the next decade.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14546v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy in the 2040s <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Samaya Nissanke, Nikhil Sarin, Chris Copperwheat, Sarah Antier, David Berge, Pablo Bosch, Archisman Ghosh, Paul Groot, Gregg Hallinan, Tanja Hinderer, Kenta Hotokezaka, Theophanes Karydas, Mansi Kasliwal, Yves Kini, Rubina Kotak, Kumiko Kotera, Marek Kowalski, Luke Krauth, Kruthi Krishna, Thomas Kupfer, Paraskevas Lampropoulos, Andrew Levan, Ioannis Liodis, Lea Marcotulli, Kunal Mooley, Silvia Piranomonte, Nanda Rea, Martin Roth, Simone Scaringi, Steve Schulze, Lami Suleiman, Nial Tanvir, Angela Zegarelli, Sylvia J.
