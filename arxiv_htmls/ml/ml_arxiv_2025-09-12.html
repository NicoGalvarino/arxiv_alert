especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09070v1" target="_blank"><h2>STRIDE: Scalable and Interpretable XAI via Subset-Free Functional
  Decomposition</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chaeyun Ko</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 2 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> explainable (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09328v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstruction of the depth of the shower maximum of air showers with

  networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Steffen Hahn</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025). 8 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing
mysteries in astroparticle physics. In order to identify their sources, we need
precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of
UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of
mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs
interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these
mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the
Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three
sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with
different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can
extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest
sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of
using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the
shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the
second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study
shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and
outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that,
after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the
SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower
maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09160v1" target="_blank"><h2>Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with

sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09123v1" target="_blank"><h2>Binary Black Hole Phase Space Discovers the Signature of Pair
  Instability Supernovae Mass Gap</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Samsuzzaman Afroz, Suvodip Mukherjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract), VAE (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The rapidly expanding catalog of gravitational-wave detections provides a
powerful probe of the formation history of compact binaries across cosmic time.
In this work, we extend the Binary Compact Object (BCO) phase-space framework
to the full set of events in the GWTC-4 catalog to map the observed binary
formation scenarios in a data-driven way. Applying this framework, we identify
distinct regions of phase-space associated with different channels and discover
for the first time a unique mass-cutoff scale in a data-driven way. The mapping
of these on different formation channels reveals a population of
first-generation (1G) black holes sharply truncated at approximately 45.5
$M_\odot$, consistent with the theoretically predicted pair-instability
supernova (PISN) mass gap. These findings demonstrate the capability of the BCO
phase-space to disentangle overlapping formation pathways, establish robust
connections between gravitational-wave observations and binary evolution, and
highlight the potential of upcoming observing runs to reveal rare populations
and exotic origins.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09522v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards Explainable Job Title Matching: Leveraging Semantic Textual
  Relatedness and Knowledge Graphs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Vadim Zadykian, Bruno Andrade, Haithem Afli</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CL, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> explainability (abstract), explainable (title), neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09513v1" target="_blank"><h2>Explainable AI for Accelerated Microstructure Imaging: A SHAP-Guided

for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as
compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time.
However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a
reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model
accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a
data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided
recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset
from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was
validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative
reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,
and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded
parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low
estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest
variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the
optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in
water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid
optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes
without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader
application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in
neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for
designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09251v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unsupervised Multi-Attention Meta Transformer for Rotating Machinery
  Fault Diagnosis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hanyang Wang, Yuxuan Yang, Hongjun Wang, Lihui Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (title, abstract), attention (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.</p></br></body>
