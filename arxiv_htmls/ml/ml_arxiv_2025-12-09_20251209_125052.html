Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07281v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Dark Energy and the Unresolved Hubble Tension: Multi-model Constraints from DESI 2025 and Other Probes <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhuoming Zhang, Tengpeng Xu, Yun Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a Bayesian comparative analysis of five cosmological models: $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, $φ$CDM (with scalar-field dark energy), and an interacting dark energy scenario (the $ξ$ model), to investigate dark energy evolution and the Hubble tension. Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$). Third, the full dataset suggests a late-time interaction between dark energy and matter. Our results demonstrate that dark energy evolves with cosmic time, challenging the cosmological constant paradigm.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07236v1" target="_blank"><h2>Counting voids and filaments: Betti Curves as a Powerful Probe for Cosmology <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jiayi Li, Cheng Zhao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 15 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Topological analysis of galaxy distributions has gathered increasing attention in cosmology, as they are able to capture non-Gaussian features of large-scale structures (LSS) that are overlooked by conventional two-point clustering statistics. We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $σ_8$, and $Ω_{\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $σ_8$, and $w$. These findings highlight Betti curves -- especially when combined with traditional two-point statistics -- as a promising, interpretable tool for future galaxy survey analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07125v1" target="_blank"><h2>Vision Transformers for Cosmological Fields: Application to Weak Lensing Mass Maps</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jash Kakadia, Shubh Agrawal, Kunhao Zhong, Bhuvnesh Jain<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 AI4Physics<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract), transformer (title, abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of the universe's growth history. While traditional two-point statistics capture only the Gaussian features of the convergence field, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in extracting non-Gaussian information from small-scale, nonlinear structures. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of attention-based architectures, including variants of vision transformers (ViTs) and shifted window (Swin) transformers, in constraining the cosmological parameters $Ω_m$ and $S_8$ from weak lensing mass maps. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare transformer-based methods to CNNs. We also examine performance scaling with the number of available $N$-body simulations, highlighting the importance of pre-training for transformer architectures. We find that the Swin transformer performs significantly better than vanilla ViTs, especially with limited training data. Despite their higher representational capacity, the Figure of Merit for cosmology achieved by transformers is comparable to that of CNNs under realistic noise conditions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07066v1" target="_blank"><h2>Trends in gravitational wave emission in axisymmetric simulations of rotating core-collapse supernovae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bailey Sykes, Bernhard Müller<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 16 figures, submitted to PRD<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The quantitative impact of strong rotation on the amplitudes and frequencies of the post-bounce gravitational wave (GW) signal from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still not fully understood. To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07049v1" target="_blank"><h2>Giant outbursts of clumpy material preceding Type II supernova 2024qiw</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> T.

Here we report evidence of giant outbursts of clumpy material from a massive star in the final decades before explosion. Photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric data of SN~2024qiw reveal a bumpy light curve, a broad H$α$ profile, and variable polarization, all consistent with interaction between SN ejecta and clumpy circumstellar material, implying a mass-loss rate of $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Taken together, the most likely explanation is multiple major eruptions, similar to those of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), but occurring shortly before explosion. This challenges standard stellar evolution theory by requiring either that LBVs explode terminally, or that other evolutionary phases produce eruptive episodes. In spite of very high pre-SN mass loss, the resulting SN is of Type~II, rather than Type IIn, highlighting diverse and previously unrecognized late-stage mass-loss processes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06719v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Extended WZDR Model with Interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter and Stepped Dark Radiation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gang Liu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-07<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this paper, we explore the interaction between scalar field dark matter and stepped dark radiation as an extension of the WZDR model. The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\log_{10}(ξ)<4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06642v1" target="_blank"><h2>Masked Autoencoder Pretraining on Strong-Lensing Images for Joint Dark-Matter Model Classification and Super-Resolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Achmad Ardani Prasha, Clavino Ourizqi Rachmadi, Muhamad Fauzan Ibnu Syahlan, Naufal Rahfi Anugerah, Nanda Garin Raditya, Putri Amelia, Sabrina Laila Mutiara, Hilman Syachr Ramadhan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 7 figures, 3 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-07<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Strong gravitational lensing can reveal the influence of dark-matter substructure in galaxies, but analyzing these effects from noisy, low-resolution images poses a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06454v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the Distance Duality Relation with Cosmological Observations at high Redshift using Artificial Neural Network <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yukang Xie, Yang Liu, Puxun Wu, Xiangyun Fu, Nan Liang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract), neural network (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The cosmic Distance Duality Relation (DDR) is a fundamental prediction of metric gravity under photon number conservation.

The vast majority of these events will lack spectroscopic classification and redshifts, necessitating a fully photometric approach to maximize cosmology constraining power. We present detailed simulations based on the Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), and a cosmological analysis using photometrically classified SNeIa with host galaxy photometric redshifts. This dataset features realistic multi-band light curves, non-SNIa contamination, host mis-associations, and transient-host correlations across the high-redshift Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) (~ 50 deg^2). We also include a spectroscopically confirmed low-redshift sample based on the Wide Fast Deep (WFD) fields. We employ a joint SN+host photometric redshift fit, a neural network based photometric classifier (SCONE), and BEAMS with Bias Corrections (BBC) methodology to construct a bias-corrected Hubble diagram. We produce statistical + systematic covariance matrices, and perform cosmology fitting with a prior using Cosmic Microwave Background constraints. We fit and present results for the wCDM dark energy model, and the more general Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) w0wa model. With a simulated sample of ~6000 events, we achieve a Figure of Merit (FoM) value of about 150, which is significantly larger than the DESVYR FoM of 54. Averaging analysis results over 25 independent samples, we find small but significant biases indicating a need for further analysis testing and development.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06271v1" target="_blank"><h2>CLASSY XIV: The Nitrogen Exception -- Multi-Phase Enrichment and Feedback in High-$z$ Analogs <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bethan L.

Using co-spatial UV absorption and optical emission-line spectroscopy, we compare abundances of N, O, S, and Fe in the low-ionization (neutral) and high-ionization (ionized) gas, providing a multi-phase view of enrichment shortly after the current starburst and over longer timescales when ejecta from previous episodes have cooled and mixed. We find that O and S, produced predominantly in short-lived massive stars, are well mixed between the two phases, with scatter reflecting local inhomogeneities. Fe, predominantly produced by Type Ia supernovae on $\sim$1 Gyr timescales, is higher in the neutral gas, reflecting either delayed mixing of older Fe-enriched material or preferential depletion of Fe from the ionized phase through dust formation in core-collapse supernova ejecta. N exhibits the largest phase offset, with N/H$_{ion}$ systematically $\sim$0.7 dex higher than N/H$_{neu}$, and the magnitude of this offset correlates with stellar mass, metallicity, star-formation rate, and most strongly with the ISM outflow velocity. N/O ratios in the ionized phase rise rapidly within 3-6 Myr relative to the neutral gas, consistent with N enrichment dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars rather than intermediate-mass AGB stars on longer timescales. These results demonstrate that localized stellar feedback, outflows, and phase-dependent mixing collectively regulate the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, providing key insight into the extreme N/O abundances recently observed in galaxies at cosmic dawn.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06085v1" target="_blank"><h2>The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha intensity mapping of cosmic reionization <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mouza Almualla, Aaron Smith, Rahul Kannan, Lars Hernquist, Enrico Garaldi, Adam Lidz, Kevin Lorinc, Jennifer Yik Ham Chan, Mark Vogelsberger<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 23 figures, 2 tables.

Lyman-alpha emission in the EoR is strongly shaped by resonant absorption from neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM), which transforms galactic sources into a low surface-brightness background. In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art THESAN cosmological simulations to produce high-resolution theoretical predictions for future Lyman-alpha LIM studies, constructing continuous light cones for line-of-sight cosmological integrations. We assess the contributions of recombination, collisional excitation, and unresolved HII regions to the total Lyman-alpha spectral intensity. In addition, we explore the IGM in absorption at different redshifts using damping wing analysis. We produce channel maps exploring spatial fluctuations across redshift bands probe-able by LIM instruments. We find that the slope of the absorption-included Lyman-alpha fluctuation power spectrum at smaller scales (k > 10^(-2) 1/arcsec) steepens toward lower redshift, and that our emission-only Lyman-alpha power spectrum lies above the SPHEREx sensitivity, whereas the absorption-included signal is ~4 orders of magnitude lower--providing a conservative lower limit on inhomogeneity signatures and highlighting the importance of including resonant scattering in our model in the future. We also find that including outflows in a simple toy model boosts power by four orders of magnitude. We identify limitations in our analysis and propose next steps, including incorporating the effects of resonant Lyman-alpha scattering and line interlopers, as well as larger simulation volumes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05909v1" target="_blank"><h2>Learning the Cosmic Web: Graph-based Classification of Simulated Galaxies by their Dark Matter Environments <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dakshesh Kololgi, Krishna Naidoo, Amelie Saintonge, Ofer Lahav<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables, submitted to Royal Astronomical Society Techniques and Instruments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments.

Traditional efforts have relied primarily on theoretical modeling grounded in nuclear and particle physics, with subsequent validation against empirical constraints from heavy ion collisions and, increasingly, multimessenger astrophysical observations. Recent developments, however, have introduced complementary analytical strategies that merge theoretical modeling with advanced data driven methodologies. In particular, Bayesian inference, machine learning, and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for constraining the EoS and extracting physical insight from complex observational datasets. In this work, we employ state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze mass radius relations of compact objects with the aim of reconstructing or inferring their underlying equations of state. The analysis is based on an extensive library of physically consistent, multimodal EoSs for neutron stars and a corresponding set for quark stars, each constructed to satisfy established theoretical and observational constraints. By leveraging the predictive capacity of these computational frameworks, we demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches to provide refined insights into the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities and to contribute to a more unified understanding of the dense matter EoS.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05458v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating Unusually Extended Main Sequence Turnoff of the Galactic Open Cluster NGC 3532 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Khushboo K Rao, Wen-Ping Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multi-modal (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extended main-sequence turnoffs are observed in the color-magnitude diagrams of some young and intermediate-age star clusters. Here we report the case study of NGC 3532. Among the cluster member candidates identified using the ML-MOC algorithm on Gaia DR3 sources, we found that fast rotators are significantly redder. Stars near the main-sequence turnoff exhibit a multi-modal distribution in the Gaia broadening velocity ($v_{\rm broad}$). A comparison with relevant literature suggests binaries being typically interspersed with fast rotators, often manifesting as slow to moderate rotators. Additionally, chemically peculiar stars are predominantly located in the bluer regions of the turnoff, with those in the fast-rotator region having large values of Gaia re-normalised unit weight error, indicating plausible companions. Our analysis suggests multiple channels responsible for angular momentum loss to account for the extended turnoff.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05220v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multiple outflows and delayed ejections revealed by early imaging of novae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elias Aydi, John D.

Although most of the accreted envelope is expelled, the mechanism -- impulsive ejection, multiple outflows or prolonged winds, or a common-envelope interaction -- remains uncertain. GeV $γ$-ray detections from $>20$ Galactic novae establish these eruptions as nearby laboratories for shock physics and particle acceleration, underscoring the need to determine how novae eject their envelopes. Here we report on near-infrared interferometry, supported with multiwavelength observations, of two $γ$-ray detected novae. The images of the very fast 2021 nova V1674~Her, taken just 2--3 days after discovery, reveal the presence of two perpendicular outflows. The interaction between these outflows likely drives the observed $γ$-ray emission. Conversely, the images of the very slow 2021 nova V1405~Cas suggest a delay in the ejection of the bulk of the accreted envelope of more than 50 days after the start of eruption, as the nova slowly rises to visible peak and during which the envelope engulfed the system in a common envelope phase. These unprecedented images offer direct observational evidence that the mechanisms driving mass ejection from the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs are not as simple as previously thought, revealing multiple outflows and delayed ejections.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Albert Escrivà, Jaume Garriga, Shi Pi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages and 11 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $ζ[ζ_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $δN$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04946v1" target="_blank"><h2>MALLORN: Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dylan Magill, Matt Nicholl, Vysakh Anilkumar, Sjoert van Velzen, Xinyue Sheng, Thai Son Mai, Hung Viet Tran, Ngoc Phu Doan, Thomas Moore, Shubham Srivastav, David R.

Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04804v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with MUSE <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alessandro Veutro, Irene Di Palma, Marco Drago, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Robin van der Laag, Melissa López, Fulvio Ricci<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract), convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life can give rise to one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe.

However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope.

In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$σ$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04378v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mini-supernovae from white dwarf-neutron star mergers: Viewing-angle-dependent spectra and lightcurves <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yacheng Kang, Jin-Ping Zhu, Lijing Shao, Jiahang Zhong, Jinghao Zhang, Bing Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under final review at A&A after minor revisions, 14 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Unstable mass transfer may occur during white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) mergers, in which the WD can be tidally disrupted and form an accretion disk around the NS. Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation.
  We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using "mini-supernovae" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04327v1" target="_blank"><h2>A distance measurement for blazar TXS 0506+056 using its radio variability and very long baseline images <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chanwoo Song, Sang-Sung Lee, Sincheol Kang, Whee Yeon Cheong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> causality (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the results of constraining the angular diameter distance to blazar TXS 0506+056. We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $Λ$CDM model within 1$σ$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $Λ$CDM distance of $948.2\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $Λ$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04145v1" target="_blank"><h2>Minuet: A Diffusion Autoencoder for Compact Semantic Compression of Multi-Band Galaxy Images <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alexander T.

Rubin Observatory is slated to observe nearly 20 billion galaxies during its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z<1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04031v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large Language Models for Limited Noisy Data: A Gravitational Wave Identification Study <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yixuan Li, Yuhao Lu, Yang Liu, Liang Li, R.

We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $λ$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $θ$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03695v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ANDICAM-SOFI Near-infrared and Optical type Ia Supernova (ASNOS) sample: Description and data release <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kim Phan, Lluís Galbany, Tomás E.

Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03331v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio Detection of a Local Little Red Dot <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> L.

One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\pm$8 $μ$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\pm$3 $μ$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03329v1" target="_blank"><h2>Push-broom Mapping of Galaxies and Supernova Remnants with the SPRITE CubeSat <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elena Carlson, Brian Fleming, Yi Hang Valerie Wong, Briana Indahl, Dmitry Vorobiev, Maitland Bowen, Donal O'Sullivan, Kevin France, Anne Jaskot, Jason Tumlinson, Sanchayeeta Borthakur, Michael Rutkowski, Stephan McCandliss, Ravi Sankrit, John M.

The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03264v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparison of Ne-22 core and shell distilled WD detonations in AREPO <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Uri Pierre Burmester, Lilia Ferrario, Ivo R.

These simulations, conducted with the moving-mesh code AREPO, aim to investigate the effects of chemical separation on the ejecta and spectra of such WDs undergoing thermonuclear explosions. The distillation process alters the internal chemical stratification of the star, concentrating neutron-rich material either in a central core or in an interior shell. We model both configurations as well as a homogeneous equivalent for each case with the same $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$ content distributed evenly at all radii. Despite similar $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$ yields between the core and shell models ($0.40$ and $0.45 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ respectively), the two models yield markedly different iron-group abundances. Both distilled models showed significantly enhanced production of $^{15} \mathrm{N}$ via the decay of $^{15} \mathrm{O}$. The $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$-core model produces enhanced amounts of stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes such as $^{58} \mathrm{Ni}$ and $^{54} \mathrm{Fe}$. We highlight observational signatures associated with these differences, including potentially enhanced [$\mathrm{Ni}_{\rm II}$] lines in nebular spectra. Synthetic TARDIS spectra at early times show only moderate differences. Our results suggest that white dwarf distillation, a process linked to delayed cooling in the Gaia Q branch population, may leave detectable nucleosynthetic fingerprints in a subset of Type Ia supernovae. These findings open additional pathways to probe progenitor evolution and the role of crystallisation in shaping the diversity of thermonuclear transients.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 32 papers (5 new, 27 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
