representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17256v1" target="_blank"><h2>Provable Generalization in Overparameterized Neural Nets</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aviral Dhingra</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 Pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), transformer (abstract), attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18057v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamic Fusion Multimodal Network for SpeechWellness Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wenqiang Sun, Han Yin, Jisheng Bai, Jianfeng Chen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.SD, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 5figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract), time-domain (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Previous
suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or
acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such

individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st
SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch
multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness
detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on
time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both
time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as
semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to
adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it
applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling
the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational
efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original
baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system
exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a
78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17521v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Irregular Astronomical Time Series with Neural Stochastic Delay

numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse

strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical
events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a
principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational

detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17783v1" target="_blank"><h2>Algebraic Approach to Ridge-Regularized Mean Squared Error Minimization

ReLU activation and a ridge-regularized mean squared error (RR-MSE). Our
approach leverages the fact that the RR-MSE for ReLU perceptron is piecewise
polynomial, enabling a systematic analysis using tools from computational
algebra. In particular, we develop a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy that
exhaustively enumerates all local minima of the RR-MSE. By virtue of the
algebraic formulation, our approach can identify not only the typical
zero-dimensional minima (i.e., isolated points) obtained by numerical
optimization, but also higher-dimensional minima (i.e., connected sets such as
curves, surfaces, or hypersurfaces). Although computational algebraic methods
are computationally very intensive for perceptrons of practical size, as a
proof of concept, we apply the proposed approach in practice to minimal
perceptrons with a few hidden units.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17550v1" target="_blank"><h2>In-Context Algorithm Emulation in Fixed-Weight Transformers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Hude Liu, Jennifer Yuntong Zhang, Han Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Code is available atthis https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (title, abstract), attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17175v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scaling Graph Transformers: A Comparative Study of Sparse and Dense

Mridha</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> explainability (abstract), explainable (title, abstract), neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18013v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards Continual Visual Anomaly Detection in the Medical Domain</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Manuel Barusco, Francesco Borsatti, Nicola Beda, Davide Dalle Pezze, Gian Antonio Susto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract), explainable (abstract), attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16924v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gamma-ray burst light curve reconstruction with predictive models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhunuskanov A., Sakan A., Akhmetali A., Zaidyn M., Ussipov N</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gamma-ray bursts represent some of the most energetic and complex phenomena

study proposes a machine learning-based framework for the reconstruction of
gamma-ray burst light curves, focusing specifically on the plateau phase
observed in X-ray data. The analysis compares the performance of three
sequential modeling approaches: a bidirectional recurrent neural network, a
gated recurrent architecture, and a convolutional model designed for temporal

Recurrent Unit model showed the best predictive accuracy among the evaluated
models across all GRB types, as measured by Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean
Square Error, and Coefficient of Determination. Notably, Bidirectional Gated

learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17519v1" target="_blank"><h2>TANDEM: Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential Equations for

models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text

directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different

(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%

thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These

with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes

Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each

multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,

  Conversational Recommendations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hung-Chun Hsu, Yuan-Ching Kuo, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Szu-Wei Fu, Hanrong Ye, Hongxu Yin, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Ming-Feng Tsai, Chuan-Ju Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional
product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions.
Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown
promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios
and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn
dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as
a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance
through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically
relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical
reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are
rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are
often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding
responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose
a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational
multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,
further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves
retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent
throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent
improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in
nDCG@1.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17096v1" target="_blank"><h2>Convolutional Neural Networks for Accurate Measurement of Train Speed</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Haitao Tian, Argyrios Zolotas, Miguel Arana-Catania</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables.

classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17867v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ada-TransGNN: An Air Quality Prediction Model Based On Adaptive Graph

environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark

uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17290v1" target="_blank"><h2>MEENA (PersianMMMU): Multimodal-Multilingual Educational Exams for

acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve

Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding

average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels

normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional

deep learning since it allows a model to make safer decisions when the data is
ambiguous and facilitates the users' understanding of the model's confidence in
its predictions. Along with the tremendously increasing research focus on
\emph{graph neural networks} (GNNs) in recent years, there have been numerous
techniques which strive to capture the uncertainty in their predictions.
However, most of these approaches are specifically designed for node or
link-level tasks and cannot be directly applied to graph-level learning
problems. In this paper, we propose a novel variational modelling framework for
the \emph{posterior predictive distribution}~(PPD) to obtain uncertainty-aware
prediction in graph-level learning tasks. Based on a graph-level embedding
derived from one of the existing GNNs, our framework can learn the PPD in a
data-adaptive fashion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
exhibit the effectiveness of our approach.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17215v1" target="_blank"><h2>How to make Medical AI Systems safer? Simulating Vulnerabilities, and
  Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kaiwen Zuo, Zelin Liu, Raman Dutt, Ziyang Wang, Zhongtian Sun, Yeming Wang, Fan Mo, Pietro Liò</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Sumbitted to 2025 AAAI main track</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></br></body>
