Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13544v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Adam Smith, Maria Mylova, Carsten van de Bruck, C.

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $Λ$CDM cosmology, with the $χ^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3σ$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13395v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multiband neural network classification of ZTF light curves as LSST proxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tamás Szklenár, Attila Bódi, Róbert Szabó<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this project we use data obtained by Zwicky Transient Facility to develop and test a neural-network-based, multiband classification algorithm to classify periodic variable stars (i.e. pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries). The aim is to utilize the algorithm on LSST data once they become available. Phase-folded light curve images and period information were used from five different variable star types: Classical and Type II Cepheids, δ Scuti stars, eclipsing binaries, and RR Lyrae stars. The data is taken from the 17th data release of ZTF, from which we used two passbands, g and r in this project. The periods were calculated from the raw data and this information was used as an additional numerical input in the neural network. For the training and testing process a supervised machine learning method was created, the neural network contains Convolutional Neural Networks concatenated with Fully Connected Layers.
  During the training-validation process the training accuracy reached 99% and the validation accuracy peaked at 95.6%. At the test classification phase three variable star types out of the 5 classes were classified with around 99% of accuracy, the other two also had very high accuracy, 89.6% and 93.6%.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13389v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PAU Survey: Uncovering the connection between intrinsic and observed galaxy properties using symbolic regression <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Adarsh Kumar, Carlton M.

We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ due to scatter. Our approach offers a fast, transparent alternative to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy for the bulk of the galaxy population.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13353v1" target="_blank"><h2>Super-resolving Herschel -- a deep learning based deconvolution and denoising technique <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dennis Koopmans, Lingyu Wang, Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Antonio La Marca, Matthieu Bethermin, Laura Bisigello, Zhen-Kao Gao, Claudia del P.

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $μ$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$μ$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$μ$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.
  We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $μ$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\lesssim$ 1" vs 12" pixel scale). Reliability is $\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $μ$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12733v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution Models of CO WD -- AGB Star Merger Remnants</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chengyuan Wu, Heran Xiong, Shi Jia, Zhengyang Zhang, Bo Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 8 figures, 1 tablel. Accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Common envelope evolution is a critical but still poorly understood phase in binary evolution. It plays a key role in forming close binaries such as hot subdwarfs, double white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and double neutron stars. However, its outcomes remain highly uncertain. Depending on the efficiency of envelope ejection, a system may either survive as a close binary or undergo a complete merger. In this work, we investigate the post merger evolution of systems where a CO WD mergers with the core of an AGB star. A grid of merger remnant models with various core and envelope masses is constructed. At the onset of evolution, the CO core contracts and undergoes off-center carbon ignition, producing an inwardly propagating carbon flame. For remnants with relatively low mass of CO core, the flame phase is followed by core contraction and subsequent H-shell burning. For more massive CO cores, the carbon flame reaches the center and is soon followed by off-center neon burning, which is expected to eventually lead to core-collapse supernovae. The merger remnants occupy nearly the same region on HR diagram as ordinary AGB or super-AGB stars, exhibiting similar surface properties. Although their surface abundance may differ slightly from those of normal AGB stars depending on the initial core and envelope masses, these differences are strongly reduced once mass-loss is taken into account. We suggest that some giant-like stars, including candidates for Thorne-Zytkow objects (e.g., HV 2112), might alternatively be explained as AGB-WD merger remnants.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12513v1" target="_blank"><h2>AttenGW: A Lightweight Attention-Based Multi-Detector Gravitational-Wave Detection Pipeline</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Victoria Tiki, Eliu Huerta<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), attention (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present AttenGW, an attention-based multi-detector gravitational-wave detection model and accompanying software stack designed for analysis of real LIGO data. AttenGW combines a per-detector hierarchical dilated convolutional network with an attention-based aggregation module that enforces cross-detector coherence, providing an alternative to graph-based aggregation schemes used in previous work. The pipeline adopts a LIGO-style preprocessing and data-loading workflow based on GWOSC time series, with standard whitening and filtering, and is released as a documented Python/PyTorch package. We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble. Injection studies on real LIGO noise further indicate that attention-based aggregation yields stable performance on non-Gaussian backgrounds.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12453v1" target="_blank"><h2>Toward the time-domain spectroscopic study of the dynamic life of stars: from accretion to magnetic activity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fatemeh Zahra Majidi, Amelia Bayo, Marc Audard, Francisco José Galindo-Guil, Rosaria Bonito, Katia Biazzo, Loredana Prisinzano, Mario Giuseppe Guarcello, Eleonora Fiorellino, Innocenza Busa, Germano Sacco, Richard I.

Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12399v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hybrid algorithm combining matched filtering and convolutional neural networks for searching gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Takahiro S.

Our method leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate descriptions for galaxy images, then contrastively aligns a pre-trained multimodal astronomy foundation model with these embedded descriptions to produce searchable embeddings at scale. We find that current VLMs provide descriptions that are sufficiently informative to train a semantic search model that outperforms direct image similarity search. Our model, AION-Search, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on finding rare phenomena despite training on randomly selected images with no deliberate curation for rare cases. Furthermore, we introduce a VLM-based re-ranking method that nearly doubles the recall for our most challenging targets in the top-100 results.

Using Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, we measure fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) and rest-frame structure functions (SFs) to test whether short-term jet-linked variability is reflected in long-term behaviour. $γ$-ray detected RL-NLSy1s and HPQs show steeply rising SFs, revealing strong long-term coherence despite modest $F_{\rm var}$, consistent with Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. Non-jetted RL-NLSy1s exhibit the highest $F_{\rm var}$ but plateauing SFs, indicative of stochastic, disc-driven fluctuations lacking long-term coherence. $γ$-ray undetected RL-NLSy1s show the lowest $F_{\rm var}$ and nearly flat SFs, consistent with weak or absent jet activity across all timescales. Colour-magnitude trends show that jet-dominated sources exhibit redder-when-brighter behaviour, whereas disc-dominated systems exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends. These results show that SF-derived temporal coherence, rather than variability amplitude alone, is a promising diagnostic of jet dominance and orientation, offering a framework for interpreting AGN variability in forthcoming time-domain surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11959v1" target="_blank"><h2>The automation of optical transient discovery and classification in Rubin-era time-domain astronomy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nabeel Rehemtulla, Michael W.

Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11795v1" target="_blank"><h2>Solving the Cosmological Vlasov-Poisson Equations with Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nicolas Cerardi, Emma Tolley, Ashutosh Mishra<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cold dark matter (CDM) evolves as a collisionless fluid under the Vlasov-Poisson equations, but N-body simulations approximate this evolution by discretising the distribution function into particles, introducing discreteness effects at small scales. We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11700v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Domain Adaptation problem in photometric redshift estimation: a solution applied to the HSC Survey <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i<25 (z<~5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts.

These bursts can disrupt radio communications and be indicative of large solar events that can disrupt technological infrastructure on Earth and in space. The risks posed by these events highlight the need for automated SRB classification, providing the potential to improve event detection and real-time monitoring. This would advance the techniques used to study space weather and related phenomena. A dataset containing images of radio spectra was created using data recorded by the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (e-Callisto) network. This dataset comprises three categories: empty spectrograms; spectrograms containing Type II SRBs; and spectrograms containing Type III SRBs. These images were used to fine-tune several popular pre-trained deep learning models for classifying Type II and Type III SRBs. The evaluated models included VGGnet-19, MobileNet, ResNet-152, DenseNet-201, and YOLOv8. Testing the models on the test set produced F1 scores ranging from 87\% to 92\%. YOLOv8 emerged as the best-performing model among them, demonstrating that using pre-trained models for event classification can provide an automated solution for SRB classification. This approach provides a practical solution to the limited number of data samples available for Type II SRBs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11447v1" target="_blank"><h2>The hydrogen-free circumstellar interaction in the Type Ib supernova 2021efd: A clue to the mechanism of the helium-layer stripping <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> N.

The main stripping mechanism for the hydrogen (H) envelope in the progenitors of SESNe is often considered to be interaction with a binary companion, while that for the helium (He) layer is unclear. We conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ib SN 2021efd, which shows signs of interaction with H-free circumstellar material (CSM). Around 30 days after the r-band light curve (LC) peak, until at least ~ 770 days, its LCs display excessive luminosity compared to regular SESNe and at least three distinct peaks. The light curve evolution is similar to that of SN 2019tsf, whose previously unpublished spectrum at 400 days is also presented here. The nebular spectrum of SN 2021efd shows narrow emission lines (~ 1000 km/s) in various species. Our observations suggest that SN 2021efd is a Type Ib SN interacting with CSM with the following parameters: The estimated CSM mass, composition, and distribution are at least a few times 0.1 M_sun, H-free, and clumpy, respectively. Based on the estimated ejecta properties, we conclude that this event is a transitional SN whose progenitor was experiencing He-layer stripping at the epoch of the explosion, and was on the way to becoming a carbon-oxygen star from a He star. The estimated CSM properties suggest that the progenitor had some episodic mass ejections with a rate of ~ 0.001-0.01 M_sun/yr for the last decade and slightly smaller before this final phase at least from ~ 200 years before the explosion, for the assumed CSM velocity of 100 km/s. For the case of ~ 1000 km/s, the necessary mass-loss rate would be increased by a factor of ten, and the timescales decreased by a factor of ten.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11404v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impacts of hydrogen envelope on supernova fallback and the resulting compact remnant masses <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kengo Shinoda, Yudai Suwa, Ryosuke Hirai, Ryo Sawada, Kengo Tomida, Kazunari Iwasaki, Takeru K.

In hydrogen rich progenitors, the reverse shock arising at the hydrogen-helium interface has the potential to dramatically enhance fallback, yet its overall impact across a broad explosion-energy range has not been systematically quantified. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\,M_\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11313v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Simons Observatory: Development of a Pipeline to Detect Rapid Transients in Time-Ordered Data <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Justin Clancy, Carlo Bacciagalupi, Josh Borrow, Nadia Dachlythra, Allen M.

While previous transient searches in CMB data operate in map space, our pipeline directly processes the raw time-ordered data, enabling sensitivity to fast, dynamic signals. We integrate our detection approach into the Simons Observatory time-domain pipeline and assess the performance on simulated observations with injected stellar flare-like light curves. For events flaring with a timescale of 0.5 s, the pipeline detects $\gtrsim90$% of events at flux densities of 800, 1150, 1650, and 4250 mJy when measured in the 93, 145, 225, and 280 GHz bands respectively. For longer $\ge5$ second flares, the 90% detection thresholds are reduced by a factor of four. We are able to determine the position of detected events in each observing band, with a positional uncertainty at the detection threshold comparable to the telescope resolution at that band. These results demonstrate the readiness of this pipeline for incorporation into upcoming Simons Observatory data analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11162v1" target="_blank"><h2>Classifying High-Energy Celestial Objects with Machine Learning Methods <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alexis Mathis, Daniel Yu, Nolan Faught, Tyrian Hobbs.<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, stat.ML<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 13 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Machine learning is a field that has been growing in importance since the early 2010s due to the increasing accuracy of classification models and hardware advances that have enabled faster training on large datasets.

In situ analysis, which processes data during simulation runtime and bypasses costly intermediate I/O steps, offers a promising solution. We present libyt (https://github.com/yt-project/libyt), an open-source C library that enables astrophysical simulations to analyze and visualize data in parallel computation with yt or other Python packages. libyt can invoke Python routines automatically or provide interactive entry points via a Python prompt or a Jupyter Notebook. It requires minimal intervention in researchers' workflow, allowing users to reuse job submission scripts and Python routines. We describe libyt's architecture for parallel computing in high-performance computing environments, including its bidirectional connection between simulation codes and Python, and its integration into the Jupyter ecosystem. We detail its methods for reading AMR simulations and handling in-memory data with minimal overhead, and procedures for yielding data when requested by Python. We describe how libyt maps simulation data to yt frontends, allowing post-processing scripts to be converted into in situ analysis with just two lines of change. We document libyt's API and demonstrate its integration into two astrophysical simulation codes, GAMER and Enzo, using examples including core-collapse supernovae, isolated dwarf galaxies, fuzzy dark matter, the Sod shock tube test, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the AGORA galaxy simulation.

In recent years, data-driven spectroscopy has proven to be an effective means of deriving stellar properties for large samples of stars, sidestepping issues with computational efficiency, incomplete line lists, and radiative transfer calculations associated with physical stellar models. A logical application of these algorithms is the detection of unresolved stellar binaries, which requires accurate spectroscopic models to resolve flux contributions from a fainter secondary star in the spectrum. Here we use The Cannon to train a data-driven model on spectra from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We show that our model is competitive with existing data-driven models in its ability to predict stellar properties Teff, stellar radius, [Fe/H], vsin(i), and instrumental PSF, particularly when we apply a novel wavelet-based processing step to spectra before training. We find that even with accurate estimates of star properties, our model's ability to detect unresolved binaries is limited by its approx. 3% accuracy in per-pixel flux predictions, illuminating possible limitations of data-driven model applications.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11032v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of in-situ nuclear networks and atomic opacities on neutron star merger ejecta dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and kilonovae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fabio Magistrelli, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Albino Perego, Maximilian Jacobi, Christopher J.

The impact of nuclear burning and atomic opacity is poorly understood and often treated with simplified prescriptions. We systematically investigate different treatments of nuclear heating, thermalization, and opacities in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of BNSM ejecta and kilonova light curves. Ejecta from long-term numerical-relativity simulations are evolved to ~30 days using a 2D ray-by-ray approach. We compare simplified heating-rates, thermalization prescriptions, and gray opacities with in-situ nuclear networks (NN) that track energy deposition, and include a composition-dependent thermalization scheme and frequency-dependent, atomic-physics-based opacities. Coupling NN and hydrodynamics affects nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. Assuming homologous expansion alters the abundance evolution and produces a narrower second $r$-process peak and a third peak shifted to higher mass numbers. Nuclear heating back-reaction delays and reddens the early emission. A constant thermalization underestimates the early luminosity and overestimates the late emission. Analytical opacities yield dimmer and redder kilonovae at early times ($t\lesssim$ hour) and a prolonged emission at $t\gtrsim5$ days. Resolving the first hundreds of milliseconds of hydrodynamics is essential for robust nucleosynthesis calculations, and composition-dependent thermalization and frequency-dependent, atomic opacities are needed to accurately capture the ejecta temperature and kilonova brightness and color evolution. Analytic nuclear-power fits with simplified thermalization and opacities can reproduce the density and temperature evolution of the ejecta.

This makes the intracluster medium (ICM) an ideal astrophysical system to constrain its chemical composition, hence ultimately understand metal production and enrichment on megaparsec scales. In this work, we take advantage of the unprecedented ~5 eV resolution offered by XRISM/Resolve to measure the chemical composition of the core of the bright, nearby, and metal-rich Centaurus cluster (287 ks) with unprecedented accuracy. We use these measurements to provide constraints on the stellar populations having enriched the cluster core. We derived the Fe abundance and its relative Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. We completed this high-resolution view with N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained with XMM-Newton/RGS archival data. Similarly to the core of Perseus, we find that nine out of our 11 measured abundance ratios are formally consistent with the chemical composition of our Solar System. However, the (super-solar) N/Fe and (half-solar) Mg/Fe ratios significantly differ from Perseus and/or other systems, thus provide tension with the picture of a fully solar composition ubiquitous to all systems. In addition, possible uncertainties in O/Fe and Ne/Fe with atomic codes highlight the need for studying more systems at high spectral resolution to assess (or rule out) the universality of the ICM composition in clusters' cool cores. Combinations of (AGB+)SNcc+SNIa yield models can reproduce our observed X/Fe ratios in all cases. However, whether two distinct populations of SNIa are needed depends on the weight of our RGS measurements. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a multi-metallicity gas phase in this respect.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10902v1" target="_blank"><h2>A vision for ground-based astronomy beyond the 2030s: How to build ESO's next big telescope sustainably <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Laurane Fréour, Mathilde Bouvier, Tony Mroczkowski, Callie Clontz, Fatemeh Zahra Majidi, Vasundhara Shaw, Olivier Absil, Anna Cabré, Olivier Lai, Dylan Magill, Jake D.

However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 28 papers (9 new, 19 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
