  QRS Complex Tachycardia Diagnosis from ECG</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Vaskar Chakma, Ju Xiaolin, Heling Cao, Xue Feng, Ji Xiaodong, Pan Haiyan, Gao Zhan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> explainability (abstract), explainable (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based
framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT)
from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using
Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost
and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly
available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25902v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Photometric Classifier for Tidal Disruption Events in Rubin LSST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kunal Bhardwaj, Asen Christov, Sergey Karpov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars
are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will
detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric
classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other
extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning
pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our
classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the
construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and
statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series
Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to
light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length
scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a
custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our
pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events,
including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We
achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about
72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive
features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting
characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric
classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in
forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties
through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean
TDE candidate samples.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25741v1" target="_blank"><h2>Test time training enhances in-context learning of nonlinear functions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kento Kuwataka, Taiji Suzuki</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under review at ICLR 2026. 36 pages, 2 figures, appendix included</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Test-time training (TTT) enhances model performance by explicitly updating
designated parameters prior to each prediction to adapt to the test data. While
TTT has demonstrated considerable empirical success, its theoretical
underpinnings remain limited, particularly for nonlinear models. In this paper,
we investigate the combination of TTT with in-context learning (ICL), where the
model is given a few examples from the target distribution at inference time.
We analyze this framework in the setting of single-index models
$y=\sigma_*(\langle \beta, \mathbf{x} \rangle)$, where the feature vector
$\beta$ is drawn from a hidden low-dimensional subspace. For single-layer
transformers trained with gradient-based algorithms and adopting TTT, we
establish an upper bound on the prediction risk. Our theory reveals that TTT
enables the single-layer transformers to adapt to both the feature vector
$\beta$ and the link function $\sigma_*$, which vary across tasks. This creates
a sharp contrast with ICL alone, which is theoretically difficult to adapt to
shifts in the link function. Moreover, we provide the convergence rate with
respect to the data length, showing the predictive error can be driven
arbitrarily close to the noise level as the context size and the network width
grow.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26560v1" target="_blank"><h2>Estimating Dimensionality of Neural Representations from Finite Samples</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chanwoo Chun, Abdulkadir Canatar, SueYeon Chung, Daniel Lee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG, q-bio.NC</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich
insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and
biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global
dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows
and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the
participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality,
is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected
estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On
synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true
known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings,
including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and
to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is
invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used
to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting
the finite samples appropriately.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25964v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reevaluating Convolutional Neural Networks for Spectral Analysis: A
  Focus on Raman Spectroscopy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Deniz Soysal, Xabier García-Andrade, Laura E. Rodriguez, Pablo Sobron, Laura M. Barge, Renaud Detry</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (title, abstract), neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26429v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Orthogonal Learner for Individualized Outcomes in Markov Decision
  Processes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Emil Javurek, Valentyn Melnychuk, Jonas Schweisthal, Konstantin Hess, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Preprint</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making is
central for optimizing therapeutic decisions in personalized medicine (e.g.,
which dosing sequence to give to a cancer patient). However, predicting
potential outcomes over long horizons is notoriously difficult. Existing
methods that break the curse of the horizon typically lack strong theoretical
guarantees such as orthogonality and quasi-oracle efficiency. In this paper, we
revisit the problem of predicting individualized potential outcomes in
sequential decision-making (i.e., estimating Q-functions in Markov decision
processes with observational data) through a causal inference lens. In
particular, we develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for meta-learners
in this setting with a focus on beneficial theoretical properties. As a result,
we yield a novel meta-learner called DRQ-learner and establish that it is: (1)
doubly robust (i.e., valid inference under the misspecification of one of the
nuisances), (2) Neyman-orthogonal (i.e., insensitive to first-order estimation
errors in the nuisance functions), and (3) achieves quasi-oracle efficiency
(i.e., behaves asymptotically as if the ground-truth nuisance functions were
known). Our DRQ-learner is applicable to settings with both discrete and
continuous state spaces. Further, our DRQ-learner is flexible and can be used
together with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We
validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, thereby showing
that our meta-learner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25788v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Cheap Geometry to Expensive Physics: Elevating Neural Operators via
  Latent Shape Pretraining</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhizhou Zhang, Youjia Wu, Kaixuan Zhang, Yanjia Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26145v1" target="_blank"><h2>LMILAtt: A Deep Learning Model for Depression Detection from Social
  Media Users Enhanced by Multi-Instance Learning Based on Attention Mechanism</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yukun Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25839v1" target="_blank"><h2>RAE: A Neural Network Dimensionality Reduction Method for Nearest
  Neighbors Preservation in Vector Search</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Han Zhang, Dongfang Zhao</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.DB</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to ICLR 2026</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dimensionality reduction (title, abstract), neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.</p></br></body>
