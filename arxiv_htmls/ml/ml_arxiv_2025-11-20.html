These data are often unlabelled. In this case, identifying infrequent events, such as anomalies, poses a great challenge. This problem becomes even more difficult in non-stationary environments, which can cause deterioration of the predictive performance of a model. To address the above challenges, the paper proposes an autoencoder-based incremental learning method with drift detection (strAEm++DD). Our proposed method strAEm++DD leverages on the advantages of both incremental learning and drift detection. We conduct an experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets with severe or extreme class imbalance, and provide an empirical analysis of strAEm++DD. We further conduct a comparative study, showing that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing baseline and advanced methods.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01654v1" target="_blank"><h2>Predicting concentration levels of air pollutants by transfer learning and recurrent neural network</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Iat Hang Fong, Tengyue Li, Simon Fong, Raymond K.

Accurate prediction of AP helps people to plan for their outdoor activities and aids protecting human health. In this paper, long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used to predict the future concentration of air pollutants (APS) in Macau. Additionally, meteorological data and data on the concentration of APS have been utilized. Moreover, in Macau, some air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs) have less observed data in quantity, and, at the same time, some AQMSs recorded less observed data of certain types of APS. Therefore, the transfer learning and pre-trained neural networks have been employed to assist AQMSs with less observed data to build a neural network with high prediction accuracy. The experimental sample covers a period longer than 12-year and includes daily measurements from several APS as well as other more classical meteorological values. Records from five stations, four out of them are AQMSs and the remaining one is an automatic weather station, have been prepared from the aforesaid period and eventually underwent to computational intelligence techniques to build and extract a prediction knowledge-based system. As shown by experimentation, LSTM RNNs initialized with transfer learning methods have higher prediction accuracy; it incurred shorter training time than randomly initialized recurrent neural networks.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00966v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Hybrid Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Framework for Intrusion Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rahul Kale, Zhi Lu, Kar Wai Fok, Vrizlynn L.

The large volume and high complexity of such intrusion attacks have impeded the effectiveness of most traditional defence techniques. While at the same time, the remarkable performance of the machine learning methods, especially deep learning, in computer vision, had garnered research interests from the cyber security community to further enhance and automate intrusion detections. However, the expensive data labeling and limitation of anomalous data make it challenging to train an intrusion detector in a fully supervised manner. Therefore, intrusion detection based on unsupervised anomaly detection is an important feature too. In this paper, we propose a three-stage deep learning anomaly detection based network intrusion attack detection framework. The framework comprises an integration of unsupervised (K-means clustering), semi-supervised (GANomaly) and supervised learning (CNN) algorithms. We then evaluated and showed the performance of our implemented framework on three benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2018, and TON_IoT.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02496v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting Graph Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhiyuan Liu, Chunjie Cao, Fangjian Tao, Jingzhang Sun</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 4 figures, graph anomaly detection on attribute network</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract), neural network (abstract), attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Combining Graph neural networks (GNNs) with contrastive learning for anomaly detection has drawn rising attention recently. Existing graph contrastive anomaly detection (GCAD) methods have primarily focused on improving detection capability through graph augmentation and multi-scale contrast modules. However, the underlying mechanisms of how these modules work have not been fully explored. We dive into the multi-scale and graph augmentation mechanism and observed that multi-scale contrast modules do not enhance the expression, while the multi-GNN modules are the hidden contributors. Previous studies have tended to attribute the benefits brought by multi-GNN to the multi-scale modules. In the paper, we delve into the misconception and propose Multi-GNN and Augmented Graph contrastive framework MAG, which unified the existing GCAD methods in the contrastive self-supervised perspective. We extracted two variants from the MAG framework, L-MAG and M-MAG. The L-MAG is the lightweight instance of the MAG, which outperform the state-of-the-art on Cora and Pubmed with the low computational cost. The variant M-MAG equipped with multi-GNN modules further improve the detection performance. Our study sheds light on the drawback of the existing GCAD methods and demonstrates the potential of multi-GNN and graph augmentation modules.

Nowadays, the majority of applied techniques refer to handcrafted rules derived from known fraud scenarios. While fairly successful, these rules exhibit the drawback that they often fail to generalize beyond known fraud scenarios and fraudsters gradually find ways to circumvent them. In contrast, more advanced approaches inspired by the recent success of deep learning often lack seamless interpretability of the detected results. To overcome this challenge, we propose the application of adversarial autoencoder networks. We demonstrate that such artificial neural networks are capable of learning a semantic meaningful representation of real-world journal entries. The learned representation provides a holistic view on a given set of journal entries and significantly improves the interpretability of detected accounting anomalies. We show that such a representation combined with the networks reconstruction error can be utilized as an unsupervised and highly adaptive anomaly assessment. Experiments on two datasets and initial feedback received by forensic accountants underpinned the effectiveness of the approach.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05478v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mul-GAD: a semi-supervised graph anomaly detection framework via aggregating multi-view information</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhiyuan Liu, Chunjie Cao, Jingzhang Sun</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Graph anomaly detection on attribute network</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract), neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Anomaly detection is defined as discovering patterns that do not conform to the expected behavior. Previously, anomaly detection was mostly conducted using traditional shallow learning techniques, but with little improvement. As the emergence of graph neural networks (GNN), graph anomaly detection has been greatly developed. However, recent studies have shown that GNN-based methods encounter challenge, in that no graph anomaly detection algorithm can perform generalization on most datasets. To bridge the tap, we propose a multi-view fusion approach for graph anomaly detection (Mul-GAD). The view-level fusion captures the extent of significance between different views, while the feature-level fusion makes full use of complementary information. We theoretically and experimentally elaborate the effectiveness of the fusion strategies. For a more comprehensive conclusion, we further investigate the effect of the objective function and the number of fused views on detection performance. Exploiting these findings, our Mul-GAD is proposed equipped with fusion strategies and the well-performed objective function. Compared with other state-of-the-art detection methods, we achieve a better detection performance and generalization in most scenarios via a series of experiments conducted on Pubmed, Amazon Computer, Amazon Photo, Weibo and Books.

This fact motivates us to propose the Beta Wavelet Graph Neural Network (BWGNN).

Published in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract), neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Anomaly detection on attributed networks attracts considerable research interests due to wide applications of attributed networks in modeling a wide range of complex systems. Recently, the deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have shown promising results over shallow approaches, especially on networks with high-dimensional attributes and complex structures. However, existing approaches, which employ graph autoencoder as their backbone, do not fully exploit the rich information of the network, resulting in suboptimal performance. Furthermore, these methods do not directly target anomaly detection in their learning objective and fail to scale to large networks due to the full graph training mechanism. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we present a novel contrastive self-supervised learning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks. Our framework fully exploits the local information from network data by sampling a novel type of contrastive instance pair, which can capture the relationship between each node and its neighboring substructure in an unsupervised way. Meanwhile, a well-designed graph neural network-based contrastive learning model is proposed to learn informative embedding from high-dimensional attributes and local structure and measure the agreement of each instance pairs with its outputted scores. The multi-round predicted scores by the contrastive learning model are further used to evaluate the abnormality of each node with statistical estimation. In this way, the learning model is trained by a specific anomaly detection-aware target. Furthermore, since the input of the graph neural network module is batches of instance pairs instead of the full network, our framework can adapt to large networks flexibly. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on all seven benchmark datasets.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09030v2" target="_blank"><h2>Contextual Learning for Anomaly Detection in Tabular Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Spencer King, Zhilu Zhang, Ruofan Yu, Baris Coskun, Wei Ding, Qian Cui</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to TMLR. 26 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables, 1 algorithm, 8 datasets, contextual anomaly detection framework for tabular data</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance, especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised anomaly detection-where no labeled anomalies are available-remains challenging because traditional deep learning methods model a single global distribution, assuming all samples follow the same behavior. In contrast, real-world data often contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users, accounts, or devices), where globally rare events may be normal within specific conditions. We introduce a contextual learning framework that explicitly models how normal behavior varies across contexts by learning conditional data distributions $P(\mathbf{Y} \mid \mathbf{C})$ rather than a global joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X})$. The framework encompasses (1) a probabilistic formulation for context-conditioned learning, (2) a principled bilevel optimization strategy for automatically selecting informative context features using early validation loss, and (3) theoretical grounding through variance decomposition and discriminative learning principles. We instantiate this framework using a novel conditional Wasserstein autoencoder as a simple yet effective model for tabular anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that contextual learning consistently outperforms global approaches-even when the optimal context is not intuitively obvious-establishing a new foundation for anomaly detection in heterogeneous tabular data.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16308v1" target="_blank"><h2>Anomaly Detection of Tabular Data Using LLMs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aodong Li, Yunhan Zhao, Chen Qiu, Marius Kloft, Padhraic Smyth, Maja Rudolph, Stephan Mandt</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted at the Anomaly Detection with Foundation Models workshop</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential in long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning.

However, when small crafted perturbations are introduced to those history trajectories, the resulting anomalous (or adversarial) trajectories can significantly mislead the future trajectory prediction module of the ego vehicle, which may result in unsafe planning and even fatal accidents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect such anomalous trajectories of the surrounding vehicles for system safety, but few works have addressed this issue. In this work, we propose two novel methods for learning effective and efficient representations for online anomaly detection of vehicle trajectories. Different from general time-series anomaly detection, anomalous vehicle trajectory detection deals with much richer contexts on the road and fewer observable patterns on the anomalous trajectories themselves. To address these challenges, our methods exploit contrastive learning techniques and trajectory semantics to capture the patterns underlying the driving scenarios for effective anomaly detection under supervised and unsupervised settings, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our supervised method based on contrastive learning and unsupervised method based on reconstruction with semantic latent space can significantly improve the performance of anomalous trajectory detection in their corresponding settings over various baseline methods. We also demonstrate our methods' generalization ability to detect unseen patterns of anomalies.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07773v1" target="_blank"><h2>PCA-Guided Autoencoding for Structured Dimensionality Reduction in Active Infrared Thermography</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mohammed Salah, Numan Saeed, Davor Svetinovic, Stefano Sfarra, Mohammed Omar, Yusra Abdulrahman</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Infrared thermography, Non-Destructive Testing, Principal Component Analysis, PCA-Guided Autoencoder, PCA Distillation Loss, Dimensionality Reduction</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dimensionality reduction (title, abstract), latent space (abstract), neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive testing (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial components. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches employ non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the latent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness in downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding framework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate, non-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured latent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to guide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA components while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic signals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we propose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability for defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed PCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on PVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and neural network-based metrics.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10596v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards Clinical Practice: Design and Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network-Based Assistive Diagnosis System for COVID-19 Case Detection from Chest X-Ray Images</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Daniel Kvak, Marian Bendik, Anna Chromcova</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> computer-aided detection, convolutional neural network, COVID-19, deep learning, image classification</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (title, abstract), neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> One of the critical tools for early detection and subsequent evaluation of the incidence of lung diseases is chest radiography.

Given a multitude of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the observations?

The overarching goal of this framework is to identify unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical results to substantiate our theoretical claims.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06009v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Recurrent Probabilistic Neural Network with Dimensionality Reduction Based on Time-series Discriminant Component Analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hideaki Hayashi, Taro Shibanoki, Keisuke Shima, Yuichi Kurita, Toshio Tsuji</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Published in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dimensionality reduction (title, abstract), neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper proposes a probabilistic neural network developed on the basis of time-series discriminant component analysis (TSDCA) that can be used to classify high-dimensional time-series patterns.

The TSDCN is considered to enable high-accuracy classification of high-dimensional time-series patterns and to reduce the computation time taken for network training. The validity of the TSDCN is demonstrated for high-dimensional artificial data and EEG signals in the experiments conducted during the study.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05493v1" target="_blank"><h2>Network Volume Anomaly Detection and Identification in Large-scale Networks based on Online Time-structured Traffic Tensor Tracking</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hiroyuki Kasai, Wolfgang Kellerer, Martin Kleinsteuber</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.NI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper addresses network anomography, that is, the problem of inferring network-level anomalies from indirect link measurements. This problem is cast as a low-rank subspace tracking problem for normal flows under incomplete observations, and an outlier detection problem for abnormal flows. Since traffic data is large-scale time-structured data accompanied with noise and outliers under partial observations, an efficient modeling method is essential. To this end, this paper proposes an online subspace tracking of a Hankelized time-structured traffic tensor for normal flows based on the Candecomp/PARAFAC decomposition exploiting the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. We estimate abnormal flows as outlier sparse flows via sparsity maximization in the underlying under-constrained linear-inverse problem. A major advantage is that our algorithm estimates normal flows by low-dimensional matrices with time-directional features as well as the spatial correlation of multiple links without using the past observed measurements and the past model parameters. Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence per iteration of model approximation, and better volume anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06661v1" target="_blank"><h2>GEE: A Gradient-based Explainable Variational Autoencoder for Network Anomaly Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Quoc Phong Nguyen, Kar Wai Lim, Dinil Mon Divakaran, Kian Hsiang Low, Mun Choon Chan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> to appear in 2019 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> variational autoencoder (title, abstract), VAE (abstract), anomaly detection (title, abstract), explainable (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper looks into the problem of detecting network anomalies by analyzing NetFlow records.

Recent works build deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mapping the normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the feature space or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number of annotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminative loss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel strategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation that could be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoder to encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation, reconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the new representation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a test sample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to its projection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, we also propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those three factors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategy are clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitive methods.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16612v3" target="_blank"><h2>Data Quality Monitoring for the Hadron Calorimeters Using Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mulugeta Weldezgina Asres, Christian Walter Omlin, Long Wang, Pavel Parygin, David Yu, Jay Dittmann, The CMS-HCAL Collaboration</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables, and published version of "aXriv:2408.16612v1: Data Quality Monitoring through Transfer Learning on Anomaly Detection for the Hadron Calorimeters"</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), anomaly detection (title, abstract), neural network (abstract), transfer learning (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The proliferation of sensors brings an immense volume of spatio-temporal (ST) data in many domains, including monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics applications.

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></br></body>
