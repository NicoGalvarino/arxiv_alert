Due to their complexity and non-linear nature, it can be challenging to understand their decision-making process. While these models can effectively identify unusual spectra, interpreting the physical nature of the flagged outliers remains a major challenge. We aim to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and physical understanding by combining deep learning with interpretable ML (iML) techniques to identify and explain anomalous galaxy spectra from SDSS data. We present a flexible framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compute multiple anomaly scores, including physically-motivated variants of the mean squared error. We adapt the iML LIME algorithm to spectroscopic data, systematically explore segmentation and perturbation strategies, and compute explanation weights that identify the features most responsible for each detection. To uncover population-level trends, we normalize the LIME weights and apply clustering to the top 1\% most anomalous spectra. Our approach successfully separates instrumental artifacts from physically meaningful outliers and groups anomalous spectra into astrophysically coherent categories. These include dusty, metal-rich starbursts; chemically-enriched H\,II regions with moderate excitation; and extreme emission-line galaxies with low metallicity and hard ionizing spectra. The explanation weights align with established emission-line diagnostics, enabling a physically-grounded taxonomy of spectroscopic anomalies. Our work shows that interpretable anomaly detection provides a scalable, transparent, and physically meaningful approach to exploring large spectroscopic datasets. Our framework opens the door for incorporating interpretability tools into quality control, follow-up targeting, and discovery pipelines in current and future surveys.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07927v1" target="_blank"><h2>ExoSpikeNet: A Light Curve Analysis Based Spiking Neural Network for Exoplanet Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Maneet Chatterjee, Anuvab Sen, Subhabrata Roy</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Exoplanets are celestial bodies orbiting stars beyond our Solar System.

This study investigates a novel approach for exoplanet classification using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) applied to data obtained from the NASA Kepler mission. SNNs offer a unique advantage by mimicking the spiking behavior of neurons in the brain, allowing for more nuanced and biologically inspired processing of temporal data.

Our method targets short-duration ($\lesssim 2\,\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\simeq 20\,M_\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09211v2" target="_blank"><h2>Detection and Classification of Astronomical Targets with Deep Neural Networks in Wide Field Small Aperture Telescopes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Peng Jia, Qiang Liu, Yongyang Sun</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, cs.CV</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Wide field small aperture telescopes are widely used for optical transient observations. Detection and classification of astronomical targets in observed images are the most important and basic step. In this paper, we propose an astronomical targets detection and classification framework based on deep neural networks. Our framework adopts the concept of the Faster R-CNN and uses a modified Resnet-50 as backbone network and a Feature Pyramid Network to extract features from images of different astronomical targets. To increase the generalization ability of our framework, we use both simulated and real observation images to train the neural network. After training, the neural network could detect and classify astronomical targets automatically. We test the performance of our framework with simulated data and find that our framework has almost the same detection ability as that of the traditional method for bright and isolated sources and our framework has 2 times better detection ability for dim targets, albeit all celestial objects detected by the traditional method can be classified correctly. We also use our framework to process real observation data and find that our framework can improve 25 % detection ability than that of the traditional method when the threshold of our framework is 0.6. Rapid discovery of transient targets is quite important and we further propose to install our framework in embedded devices such as the Nvidia Jetson Xavier to achieve real-time astronomical targets detection and classification abilities.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04060v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Flexible Framework for Anomaly Detection via Dimensionality Reduction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alireza Vafaei Sadr, Bruce A.

We release DRAMA, a general python package that implements the general framework with a wide range of built-in options. We test DRAMA on a wide variety of simulated and real datasets, in up to 3000 dimensions, and find it robust and highly competitive with commonly-used anomaly detection algorithms, especially in high dimensions. The flexibility of the DRAMA framework allows for significant optimization once some examples of anomalies are available, making it ideal for online anomaly detection, active learning and highly unbalanced datasets.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.15577v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exoplanet Detection by Machine Learning with Data Augmentation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Koray Aydoğan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), data augmentation (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It has recently been demonstrated that deep learning has significant potential to automate parts of the exoplanet detection pipeline using light curve data from satellites such as Kepler \cite{borucki2010kepler} \cite{koch2010kepler} and NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \cite{ricker2010transiting}. Unfortunately, the smallness of the available datasets makes it difficult to realize the level of performance one expects from powerful network architectures.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of data augmentation techniques on light curve data from to train neural networks to identify exoplanets. The augmentation techniques used are of two classes: Simple (e.g. additive noise augmentation) and learning-based (e.g. first training a GAN \cite{goodfellow2020generative} to generate new examples). We demonstrate that data augmentation has a potential to improve model performance for the exoplanet detection problem, and recommend the use of augmentation based on generative models as more data becomes available.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14997v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Neural Network Approach to Preferred Event Selection for Low-Latency Gravitational-Wave Alerts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pratyusava Baral, Cody Messick, Patrick Brady</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration uses multiple independent search pipelines to detect gravitational waves, often resulting in multiple triggers (g-events) for a single astrophysical source. These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04634v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unsupervised Distribution Learning for Lunar Surface Anomaly Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Adam Lesnikowski, Valentin T.

Sufficiently good unsupervised data density estimation has the promise of enabling myriad useful downstream tasks, including locating lunar resources for future space flight and colonization, finding new impact craters or lunar surface reshaping, and algorithmically deciding the importance of unlabeled samples to send back from power- and bandwidth-constrained missions. We show in this work that such unsupervised learning can be successfully done in the lunar remote sensing and space science contexts.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00677v3" target="_blank"><h2>Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Cross-Survey Galaxy Morphology Classification and Anomaly Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aleksandra Ćiprijanović, Ashia Lewis, Kevin Pedro, Sandeep Madireddy, Brian Nord, Gabriel N.

Unfortunately, simply training a deep neural network on images from one data domain often leads to very poor performance on any other dataset. Here we develop a Universal Domain Adaptation method DeepAstroUDA, capable of performing semi-supervised domain alignment that can be applied to datasets with different types of class overlap. Extra classes can be present in any of the two datasets, and the method can even be used in the presence of unknown classes. For the first time, we demonstrate the successful use of domain adaptation on two very different observational datasets (from SDSS and DECaLS). We show that our method is capable of bridging the gap between two astronomical surveys, and also performs well for anomaly detection and clustering of unknown data in the unlabeled dataset. We apply our model to two examples of galaxy morphology classification tasks with anomaly detection: 1) classifying spiral and elliptical galaxies with detection of merging galaxies (three classes including one unknown anomaly class); 2) a more granular problem where the classes describe more detailed morphological properties of galaxies, with the detection of gravitational lenses (ten classes including one unknown anomaly class).</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13434v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neural network-based anomaly detection for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Y.

The WGAN is trained on the entire sample, and learns to generate realistic HSC-like images that follow the distribution of the training data. We identify images which are less well-represented in the generator's latent space, and which the discriminator flags as less realistic; these are thus anomalous with respect to the rest of the data. We propose a new approach to characterize these anomalies based on a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the residual differences between the real and WGAN-reconstructed images. We construct a subsample of ~9,000 highly anomalous images from our nearly million object sample, and further identify interesting anomalies within these; these include galaxy mergers, tidal features, and extreme star-forming galaxies.

Due to the high computational cost of matched filtering pipeline, there is a hunt for an alternative powerful system. I present, for the first time, the use of 1D residual neural network for detection of gravitational waves. Residual networks have transformed many fields like image classification, face recognition and object detection with their robust structure. With increase in sensitivity of LIGO detectors we expect many more sources of gravitational waves in the universe to be detected. However, deep learning networks are trained only once. When used for classification task, deep neural networks are trained to predict only a fixed number of classes. Therefore, when a new type of gravitational wave is to be detected, this turns out to be a drawback of deep learning. Shallow neural networks can be used to learn data with simple patterns but fail to give good results with increase in complexity of data. Remodelling the neural network with detection of each new type of GW is highly infeasible. In this letter, I also discuss ways to reduce the time required to adapt to such changes in detection of gravitational waves for deep learning methods. Primarily, I aim to create a custom residual neural network for 1-dimensional time series inputs, which can learn a ton of features from dataset without giving up on increasing the number of classes or increasing the complexity of data. I use the two class of binary coalescence signals (Binary Black Hole Merger and Binary Neutron Star Merger signals) detected by LIGO to check the performance of residual structure on gravitational waves detection.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16334v1" target="_blank"><h2>Learning to Detect Interesting Anomalies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alireza Vafaei Sadr, Bruce A.

But how does a user systematically craft good features for anomalies that have never been seen? Here we couple deep learning with active learning -- in which an Oracle iteratively labels small amounts of data selected algorithmically over a series of rounds -- to automatically and dynamically improve the data features for efficient outlier detection. This approach, AHUNT, shows excellent performance on MNIST, CIFAR10, and Galaxy-DESI data, significantly outperforming both standard anomaly detection and active learning algorithms with static feature spaces. Beyond improved performance, AHUNT also allows the number of anomaly classes to grow organically in response to Oracle's evaluations. Extensive ablation studies explore the impact of Oracle question selection strategy and loss function on performance. We illustrate how the dynamic anomaly class taxonomy represents another step towards fully personalized rankings of different anomaly classes that reflect a user's interests, allowing the algorithm to learn to ignore statistically significant but uninteresting outliers (e.g., noise). This should prove useful in the era of massive astronomical datasets serving diverse sets of users who can only review a tiny subset of the incoming data.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11620v2" target="_blank"><h2>Learning Representations of Event Time Series with Sparse Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection, Similarity Search, and Unsupervised Classification</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Steven Dillmann, Juan Rafael Martínez-Galarza</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality.

Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients.

We introduce a new Galaxy Spectra Neural Network (GaSNet-III) model that takes advantage of generative neural networks to perform these three tasks at once with very high efficiency. We use two different generative networks, an autoencoder-like network and U-Net, to reconstruct the rest-frame spectrum (after redshifting). The autoencoder-like network operates similarly to the classical PCA, learning templates (eigenspectra) from the training set and returning modeling parameters. The U-Net, in contrast, functions as an end-to-end model and shows an advantage in noise reduction. By reconstructing spectra, we can achieve classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection in the same framework. Each rest-frame reconstructed spectrum is extended to the UV and a small part of the infrared (covering the blueshift of stars). Owing to the high computational efficiency of deep learning, we scan the chi-squared value for the entire type and redshift space and find the best-fitting point. Our results show that generative networks can achieve accuracy comparable to the classical PCA methods in spectral modeling with higher efficiency, especially achieving an average of $>98\%$ classification across all classes ($>99.9\%$ for star), and $>99\%$ (stars), $>98\%$ (galaxies) and $>93\%$ (quasars) redshift accuracy under cosmology research requirements. By comparing different peaks of chi-squared curves, we define the ``robustness'' in the scanned space, offering a method to identify potential ``anomalous'' spectra. Our approach provides an accurate and high-efficiency spectrum modeling tool for handling the vast data volumes from future spectroscopic sky surveys.</p></br></body>
