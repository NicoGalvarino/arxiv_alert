  for Emission Spectroscopy: New Constraints and Atmospheric Characterization
  of WASP-69b Using JWST NIRCam and MIRI Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tonmoy Deka, Liton Majumdar, Tasneem Basra Khan, Swastik Dewan, Priyankush Ghosh, Debayan Das, Mithun Patra</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal; 25 pages, 12 figures, and 4 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Thermal emission spectra provide key insights into the atmospheric
composition and especially the temperature structure of an exoplanet. With
broader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has
enabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of
photochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable
of navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In
this work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which
employs both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and
leverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also
incorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical
species like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission
observations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place
robust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and
potential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with
non-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O
and -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The
second best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium
chemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42
(+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding
to approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval
also constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible
absorption features in the 7-8 microns range. These results highlight
NEXOTRANS's capability to significantly advance JWST emission spectra
interpretation, offering broader insights into exoplanetary atmospheres.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27146v1" target="_blank"><h2>SERVIMON: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance and Real-Time Monitoring for

Editors: C. Sterken, J. Hearnshaw & D. Valls-Gabaud</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (abstract), DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline
for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems
such as the ASTRI Mini-Array. The system enhances quality control, predictive
maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods:
ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana,
Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It
employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect
anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write
latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as
time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected
by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time
monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases
system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage,
minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally,
ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with
observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts
also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management.
Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive
maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By
leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale
experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine
learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution
for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27386v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stacking transmission spectra of different exoplanets</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  James Kirk, James E. Owen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 14 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In many areas of astronomy, spectra of different objects are co-added or
stacked to improve signal-to-noise and reveal population-level characteristics.
As the number of exoplanets with measured transmission spectra grows, it
becomes important to understand when stacking spectra from different exoplanets
is appropriate and what stacked spectra represent physically. Stacking will be
particularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of
the same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet
transmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra
generated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test
this by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward
models over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\mu$m). For two
dominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately
reflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across
planets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a
critical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$
boundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within
comparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct
sub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks
required to rule out a flat spectrum at $>5\sigma$, as a function of both cloud
deck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance
on when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in
the era of population studies of exoplanets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27631v1" target="_blank"><h2>SN 2024cld: unveiling the complex mass-loss histories of evolved

factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse
zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional
core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II
and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM)
similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified
just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical
spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex,
long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM
interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag,
with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a marked
double-plateau light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000
km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric
coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at
p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep
more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature
throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the
best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure:
a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind.
We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing
multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction
plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and
mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved
supergiant stars from afar.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27591v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-band infrared imaging reveals dusty spiral arcs around the binary

Recent work classifies this A-type
object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar
environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at
5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE
over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a
statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged
images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of
reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered
features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central
objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L,
M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10
au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second
northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric
modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location,
and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier
VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the
southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates
that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically
excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the
radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27619v1" target="_blank"><h2>Equation-of-state-informed pulse profile modeling</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mariska Hoogkamer, Nathan Rutherford, Daniela Huppenkothen, Benjamin Ricketts, Anna L.

modeling, providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense
matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate
steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several
drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference
where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but
implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here,
we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on
mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing
on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both
tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational
costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this
approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS
model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star
interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement
constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter.
For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower
than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring
larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more
extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically
questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference
further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field
theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density
extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller)
radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density
relation.</p></br></body>
