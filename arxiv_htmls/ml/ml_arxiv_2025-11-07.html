experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their
evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and
decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion
which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as
wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded
stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and
chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal" stars that
indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and
``metamorphic" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching
the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their
cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large
masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal"
track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in
preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of
order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars
significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\alpha$-elements, potentially
explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without
excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay
between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar
populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03787v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the dawn of galaxies: star formation and feedback in the JWST

highest redshift ($z>7$) Universe. This work presents a theoretical
investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art
GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the
Planck-Millennium $N$-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully
reproduces a wide range of high-$z$ observational estimates including: the
galaxy stellar mass function up to $z\sim13$ and the total (galaxies and AGN)
UV luminosity function (LF) up to $z\sim10$. We find that the AGN UV emission
represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to
$z\sim8$, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well
the observed mass-metallicity relation at $z\leq4$, while it slightly
overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At
$z\geq11$, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger
than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical
mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a
reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$. In the
framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity
functions at $z\geq10$ can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in
high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads
to a slight increase of the normalization of the $z\geq10$ mass-metallicity
relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with
negligible stellar feedback at $z>10$ also predicts larger numbers of massive
and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates
the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants
can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation
rate and galaxy stellar mass.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04435v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. X:

exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted
by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of
cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies
with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$
at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo,
Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the
convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of
high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively
low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The
subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to
resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in
the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key
galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences
(e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are
highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive
halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$)
succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV
luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics,
but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that
varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated
galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future
work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the
formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03937v1" target="_blank"><h2>Origin and Evolution of the $Ω$ Structure in the Head-Tail Radio
  Galaxy of Abell 3322</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kohei Kurahara, Takuya Akahori, Takumi Ohmura, Shintaro Yoshiura, Daisuke Ito, Yik Ki Ma, Kazuhiro Nakazawa, Yuki Omiya, Kosei Sakai, Haruka Sakemi, Motokazu Takizawa</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 10 figures, Accepted to PASJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic
nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of
head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of
shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and
cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail
galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega"
structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy
using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be
brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be
attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data
suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation
direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic
rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of
the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the
origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the
jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the
early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail
galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin
vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04122v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Cosmin Ilie</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract), JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), cosmic evolution (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM)
annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS),
offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the
formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants.
In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network
(FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize
dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data
taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to
identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's
NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real
data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates
recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and
reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo
have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The
main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte
Carlo parameter estimator used in
\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach
introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster
than the traditional method used in
\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN
model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian
uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data
for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool
for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04504v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA-ATOMS-QUARKS survey: Resolving a chemically rich massive

chemically rich bipolar outflow in a high-mass star forming region IRAS
16272$-$4837 (SDC335), utilizing high-resolution spectral line data at 1.3 mm
and 3 mm dual-bands from the ALMA ATOMS and QUARKS surveys. The high-velocity
jet is enveloped by a lower-velocity outflow cavity, containing bright knots
that show enhanced molecular intensities and elevated excitation temperatures.
Along the outflow, we have identified 35 transitions from 22 molecular species.
By analyzing the spatial distribution and kinematics of these molecular lines,
we find that the molecular inventory in the outflow is regulated by three
processes: (i) direct entrainment from the natal molecular core by the outflow;
(ii) shock-induced release of molecules or atoms from dust grains; and (iii)
thermal desorption and gas-phase reactions driven by shock heating. These
results confirm that outflows are not only dynamical structures but also active
chemical factories, where entrainment, shocks, and thermal processing jointly
enrich the molecular content. Our findings confirmed that outflow chemistry has
multi-origin nature, and provide critical insights into chemical evolution
during high-mass star formation.</p></br></body>
