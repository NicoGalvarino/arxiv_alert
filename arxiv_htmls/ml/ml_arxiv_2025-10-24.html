in astroparticle physics. The Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel
Telescopes (FAST) is a next-generation cosmic ray experiment which utilizes
ground-based fluorescence telescopes designed to detect these extremely rare
particles at energies exceeding 30 EeV. FAST offers a cost-effective and
low-maintenance solution to cover the huge detection areas required for UHECR
observation. FAST telescopes are currently installed and remotely operated in
both hemispheres, at the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array
experiment. To enable fully autonomous operation, a sophisticated trigger for
data acquisition is essential. In this paper, we present two novel triggering
algorithms inspired by those used at the largest observatories, but improved to
meet the specific requirements imposed by the FAST design. Their performance is
validated using Monte Carlo simulations of extensive air showers and UHECR
events detected by the FAST telescope in the southern hemisphere. Finally, we
present the sensitivity analysis estimate for FAST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20715v1" target="_blank"><h2>Iskay2: Signal Extraction of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect

Gallardo, Yulin Gong, Boryana Hadzhiyska, Yun-Hsin Hsu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in RNAAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The peculiar motions of massive halos probe the distribution of matter in the
universe, the gravitational potential, and the history of cosmic structure
growth. The kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect offers a robust
observational window into these properties. The pairwise kSZ estimator probes
the pairwise momentum of groups of galaxies by cross-correlating cosmic
microwave background (CMB) maps with spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, using
galaxies to trace the positions of dark matter halos. This note introduces
iskay2, an efficient pipeline designed to apply the pairwise kSZ estimator to
maps of the CMB and large galaxy catalogs. Pairwise kSZ measurements obtained
using this pipeline are compared to previously published results and are shown
to be consistent within statistical expectations. This pipeline will enable
high-precision measurements of the pairwise kSZ utilizing galaxy catalogs like
DESI combined with past, current and next-generation high-resolution CMB
experiments such as ACT, SPT and the Simons Observatory.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20373v1" target="_blank"><h2>FAST-SBF: an automatic procedure for the measurement of Surface
  Brightness Fluctuations for large sky surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gabriele Riccio, Michele Cantiello, Rebecca Habas, Nandini Hazra, Giuseppe D'Ago, Gabriella Raimondo, John P. Blakeslee, Joseph B. Jensen, Marco Mirabile, Enzo Brocato, Massimo Brescia, Claudia M. Raiteri</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), Euclid (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Surface Brightness Fluctuation method is one of the most reliable and
efficient ways of measuring distances to galaxies within 100 Mpc. While recent
implementations have increasingly relied on space-based observations, SBF
remains effective when applied to ground-based data. In particular, deep,
wide-field imaging surveys with sub-arcsecond seeing conditions allows us for
accurate SBF measurements across large samples of galaxies. With the upcoming
next generation wide-area imaging surveys, the thousands of galaxies suitable
for SBF measurements will give us the opportunity to constrain the 3D structure
of the local universe. We present FAST-SBF, a new Python-based pipeline for
measuring SBF, developed to support the analysis of large datasets from
upcoming wide-field imaging surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman. The
procedure, still in the testing and development stage, is designed for
automation and minimal user intervention, offering a fast and flexible approach
to SBF distance estimation. We validate the performance of the procedure on
high-quality imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program
(HSC-SSP), a precursor to LSST, analyzing a sample of both luminous early-type
galaxies and fainter dwarfs. Our measurements are also compared with recent
results from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and with the SPoT
stellar population synthesis models. The results show excellent agreement with
published distances, with the capability of measuring the SBF signal also for
faint dwarf galaxies. The pipeline allows the user to completely analyze a
galaxy in relatively short time ($\approx$ minutes) and significantly reduces
the need for user intervention. reduces at minimum the user intervention. The
FAST-SBF tool is planned for public release to support the community in using
SBF as a distance indicator in next-generation surveys.</p></br></body>
