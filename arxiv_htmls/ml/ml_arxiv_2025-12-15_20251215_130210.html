We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11700v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Domain Adaptation problem in photometric redshift estimation: a solution applied to the HSC Survey <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i<25 (z<~5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts. The catalogs of CNN redshifts we inferred for the XMM, DEEP2 and ELAIS fields and for the remaining COSMOS region (~4 million sources in total at i<25) are made public.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11687v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transformer Embeddings for Fast Microlensing Inference</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nolan Smyth, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur, Yashar Hezaveh<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 ML4PS workshop<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The search for free-floating planets (FFPs) is a key science driver for upcoming microlensing surveys like the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey.

These bursts can disrupt radio communications and be indicative of large solar events that can disrupt technological infrastructure on Earth and in space. The risks posed by these events highlight the need for automated SRB classification, providing the potential to improve event detection and real-time monitoring. This would advance the techniques used to study space weather and related phenomena. A dataset containing images of radio spectra was created using data recorded by the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (e-Callisto) network. This dataset comprises three categories: empty spectrograms; spectrograms containing Type II SRBs; and spectrograms containing Type III SRBs. These images were used to fine-tune several popular pre-trained deep learning models for classifying Type II and Type III SRBs. The evaluated models included VGGnet-19, MobileNet, ResNet-152, DenseNet-201, and YOLOv8. Testing the models on the test set produced F1 scores ranging from 87\% to 92\%. YOLOv8 emerged as the best-performing model among them, demonstrating that using pre-trained models for event classification can provide an automated solution for SRB classification. This approach provides a practical solution to the limited number of data samples available for Type II SRBs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11447v1" target="_blank"><h2>The hydrogen-free circumstellar interaction in the Type Ib supernova 2021efd: A clue to the mechanism of the helium-layer stripping</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> N.

The main stripping mechanism for the hydrogen (H) envelope in the progenitors of SESNe is often considered to be interaction with a binary companion, while that for the helium (He) layer is unclear. We conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ib SN 2021efd, which shows signs of interaction with H-free circumstellar material (CSM). Around 30 days after the r-band light curve (LC) peak, until at least ~ 770 days, its LCs display excessive luminosity compared to regular SESNe and at least three distinct peaks. The light curve evolution is similar to that of SN 2019tsf, whose previously unpublished spectrum at 400 days is also presented here. The nebular spectrum of SN 2021efd shows narrow emission lines (~ 1000 km/s) in various species. Our observations suggest that SN 2021efd is a Type Ib SN interacting with CSM with the following parameters: The estimated CSM mass, composition, and distribution are at least a few times 0.1 M_sun, H-free, and clumpy, respectively. Based on the estimated ejecta properties, we conclude that this event is a transitional SN whose progenitor was experiencing He-layer stripping at the epoch of the explosion, and was on the way to becoming a carbon-oxygen star from a He star. The estimated CSM properties suggest that the progenitor had some episodic mass ejections with a rate of ~ 0.001-0.01 M_sun/yr for the last decade and slightly smaller before this final phase at least from ~ 200 years before the explosion, for the assumed CSM velocity of 100 km/s. For the case of ~ 1000 km/s, the necessary mass-loss rate would be increased by a factor of ten, and the timescales decreased by a factor of ten.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11404v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impacts of hydrogen envelope on supernova fallback and the resulting compact remnant masses</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kengo Shinoda, Yudai Suwa, Ryosuke Hirai, Ryo Sawada, Kengo Tomida, Kazunari Iwasaki, Takeru K.

In hydrogen rich progenitors, the reverse shock arising at the hydrogen-helium interface has the potential to dramatically enhance fallback, yet its overall impact across a broad explosion-energy range has not been systematically quantified. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\,M_\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11313v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Simons Observatory: Development of a Pipeline to Detect Rapid Transients in Time-Ordered Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Justin Clancy, Carlo Bacciagalupi, Josh Borrow, Nadia Dachlythra, Allen M.

While previous transient searches in CMB data operate in map space, our pipeline directly processes the raw time-ordered data, enabling sensitivity to fast, dynamic signals. We integrate our detection approach into the Simons Observatory time-domain pipeline and assess the performance on simulated observations with injected stellar flare-like light curves. For events flaring with a timescale of 0.5 s, the pipeline detects $\gtrsim90$% of events at flux densities of 800, 1150, 1650, and 4250 mJy when measured in the 93, 145, 225, and 280 GHz bands respectively. For longer $\ge5$ second flares, the 90% detection thresholds are reduced by a factor of four. We are able to determine the position of detected events in each observing band, with a positional uncertainty at the detection threshold comparable to the telescope resolution at that band. These results demonstrate the readiness of this pipeline for incorporation into upcoming Simons Observatory data analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11162v1" target="_blank"><h2>Classifying High-Energy Celestial Objects with Machine Learning Methods</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alexis Mathis, Daniel Yu, Nolan Faught, Tyrian Hobbs.<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, stat.ML<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 13 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Machine learning is a field that has been growing in importance since the early 2010s due to the increasing accuracy of classification models and hardware advances that have enabled faster training on large datasets.

In situ analysis, which processes data during simulation runtime and bypasses costly intermediate I/O steps, offers a promising solution. We present libyt (https://github.com/yt-project/libyt), an open-source C library that enables astrophysical simulations to analyze and visualize data in parallel computation with yt or other Python packages. libyt can invoke Python routines automatically or provide interactive entry points via a Python prompt or a Jupyter Notebook. It requires minimal intervention in researchers' workflow, allowing users to reuse job submission scripts and Python routines. We describe libyt's architecture for parallel computing in high-performance computing environments, including its bidirectional connection between simulation codes and Python, and its integration into the Jupyter ecosystem. We detail its methods for reading AMR simulations and handling in-memory data with minimal overhead, and procedures for yielding data when requested by Python. We describe how libyt maps simulation data to yt frontends, allowing post-processing scripts to be converted into in situ analysis with just two lines of change. We document libyt's API and demonstrate its integration into two astrophysical simulation codes, GAMER and Enzo, using examples including core-collapse supernovae, isolated dwarf galaxies, fuzzy dark matter, the Sod shock tube test, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the AGORA galaxy simulation. Finally, we discuss libyt's performance, limitations related to data redistribution, extensibility, architecture, and comparisons with traditional post-processing approaches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11064v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Open Benchmark of One Million High-Fidelity Cislunar Trajectories</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Travis Yeager, Denvir Higgins, Peter Mcgill, Kerianne Pruett, Alexx Perloff, Tara Grice, Michael Schneider<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cislunar space spans from geosynchronous altitudes to beyond the Moon and will underpin future exploration, science, and security operations.

The model includes high-degree Earth/Moon gravity, solar gravity, and Earth/Sun radiation pressure; other planetary gravities are omitted by design for computational efficiency. Initial conditions uniformly sample commonly used osculating-element ranges, and each trajectory is propagated for up to six years under a single, fixed start epoch. The dataset is intended as a reusable benchmark for method development (e.g., space domain awareness, navigation, and machine learning pipelines), a reference library for statistical studies of orbit families, and a starting point for community-driven extensions (e.g., alternative epochs). We report empirically observed stability trends (e.g., a band near 5 GEO and persistence of some co-orbital classes including L4/L5 librators) as dataset descriptors rather than new dynamical results. The chief contribution is the scale, fidelity, organization (CSV/HDF5 with full state time series and metadata), and open availability, which together lower the barrier to comparative and data-driven studies in the cislunar regime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11043v1" target="_blank"><h2>Seeking Spectroscopic Binaries with Data-Driven Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Isabel Angelo, Erik Petigura, Megan Bedell<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to ApJ; 19 pages, 11 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Data-driven stellar classification has a long and important history in astronomy, dating as far back as Annie Jump Cannon's "by eye" classifications of stars into spectral types still used today. In recent years, data-driven spectroscopy has proven to be an effective means of deriving stellar properties for large samples of stars, sidestepping issues with computational efficiency, incomplete line lists, and radiative transfer calculations associated with physical stellar models. A logical application of these algorithms is the detection of unresolved stellar binaries, which requires accurate spectroscopic models to resolve flux contributions from a fainter secondary star in the spectrum. Here we use The Cannon to train a data-driven model on spectra from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We show that our model is competitive with existing data-driven models in its ability to predict stellar properties Teff, stellar radius, [Fe/H], vsin(i), and instrumental PSF, particularly when we apply a novel wavelet-based processing step to spectra before training. We find that even with accurate estimates of star properties, our model's ability to detect unresolved binaries is limited by its approx. 3% accuracy in per-pixel flux predictions, illuminating possible limitations of data-driven model applications.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11032v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of in-situ nuclear networks and atomic opacities on neutron star merger ejecta dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and kilonovae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fabio Magistrelli, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Albino Perego, Maximilian Jacobi, Christopher J.

The impact of nuclear burning and atomic opacity is poorly understood and often treated with simplified prescriptions. We systematically investigate different treatments of nuclear heating, thermalization, and opacities in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of BNSM ejecta and kilonova light curves. Ejecta from long-term numerical-relativity simulations are evolved to ~30 days using a 2D ray-by-ray approach. We compare simplified heating-rates, thermalization prescriptions, and gray opacities with in-situ nuclear networks (NN) that track energy deposition, and include a composition-dependent thermalization scheme and frequency-dependent, atomic-physics-based opacities. Coupling NN and hydrodynamics affects nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. Assuming homologous expansion alters the abundance evolution and produces a narrower second $r$-process peak and a third peak shifted to higher mass numbers. Nuclear heating back-reaction delays and reddens the early emission. A constant thermalization underestimates the early luminosity and overestimates the late emission. Analytical opacities yield dimmer and redder kilonovae at early times ($t\lesssim$ hour) and a prolonged emission at $t\gtrsim5$ days. Resolving the first hundreds of milliseconds of hydrodynamics is essential for robust nucleosynthesis calculations, and composition-dependent thermalization and frequency-dependent, atomic opacities are needed to accurately capture the ejecta temperature and kilonova brightness and color evolution. Analytic nuclear-power fits with simplified thermalization and opacities can reproduce the density and temperature evolution of the ejecta.

This makes the intracluster medium (ICM) an ideal astrophysical system to constrain its chemical composition, hence ultimately understand metal production and enrichment on megaparsec scales. In this work, we take advantage of the unprecedented ~5 eV resolution offered by XRISM/Resolve to measure the chemical composition of the core of the bright, nearby, and metal-rich Centaurus cluster (287 ks) with unprecedented accuracy. We use these measurements to provide constraints on the stellar populations having enriched the cluster core. We derived the Fe abundance and its relative Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. We completed this high-resolution view with N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained with XMM-Newton/RGS archival data. Similarly to the core of Perseus, we find that nine out of our 11 measured abundance ratios are formally consistent with the chemical composition of our Solar System. However, the (super-solar) N/Fe and (half-solar) Mg/Fe ratios significantly differ from Perseus and/or other systems, thus provide tension with the picture of a fully solar composition ubiquitous to all systems. In addition, possible uncertainties in O/Fe and Ne/Fe with atomic codes highlight the need for studying more systems at high spectral resolution to assess (or rule out) the universality of the ICM composition in clusters' cool cores. Combinations of (AGB+)SNcc+SNIa yield models can reproduce our observed X/Fe ratios in all cases. However, whether two distinct populations of SNIa are needed depends on the weight of our RGS measurements. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a multi-metallicity gas phase in this respect.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10902v1" target="_blank"><h2>A vision for ground-based astronomy beyond the 2030s: How to build ESO's next big telescope sustainably <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Laurane Fréour, Mathilde Bouvier, Tony Mroczkowski, Callie Clontz, Fatemeh Zahra Majidi, Vasundhara Shaw, Olivier Absil, Anna Cabré, Olivier Lai, Dylan Magill, Jake D.

However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10530v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological and lunar laser ranging constraints on evolving dark energy in a nonminimally coupled curvature-matter gravity model <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Riccardo March, Miguel Barroso Varela, Orfeu Bertolami, Giada Bargiacchi, Marco Muccino, Simone Dell'Agnello<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10417v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Systematic Study of Magnetic Fields Impacts on Neutrino Transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yudong Luo, Shuai Zha, Toshitaka Kajino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 7 figures, accepted by Phy. Rev.

Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\barν_e$ mean energy $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\mathcal{L_ν}$ for both $ν_e$ and $\barν_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\barν_e$ emission while suppressing that of $ν_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L_{ν_e}$ by increasing both $\mathcal{L}_{ν_e}$ and $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ whereas for $\barν_e$, the rise in $\mathcal{L}_{\barν_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L_{\barν_e}$. A systematic parameter scan of dipole field configurations suggests that, for $r_0 > 30$ km, $\langle E_{\barν_e} \rangle$ is significantly suppressed and $L_{ν_e}$ is enhanced if $B_0 \geq {2.7} \times 10^{16}$ G. These magnetic effects become negligible for $B_0$ below $\sim {7.4} \times 10^{15}$ G.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10222v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Phase-Space and Field-Level Cosmology: The Strength of Semi-Analytic Models <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Natalí S.

They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $Ω_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10130v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AURORA Survey: Constraining Chemical Enrichment Pathways at Cosmic Noon with Argon Abundances <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jack Foley, Alice Shapley, Ryan Sanders, Naveen A.

Although argon is an $α-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $α-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10023v1" target="_blank"><h2>Classification of a New X-ray Catalog of Likely Counterparts to 4FGL-DR4 Unassociated Gamma-ray Sources Using a Neural Network <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kyle D.

While effective, this method becomes inefficient when analysing large volumes of long time-series data and often relies on subjective stopping criteria to determine the number of iterations. We aim to perform frequency extraction of gravity modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars using a statistically robust, data-driven approach based on advanced power spectrum and harmonic analysis techniques. Our approach employs the multitaper non-uniform fast Fourier transform, mtNUFFT, a power spectrum estimator that addresses several statistical limitations of traditional methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We apply its extension, the multitaper F-test, to extract coherent gravity modes from 4-year Kepler light curves of SPB stars and to search for period spacing patterns among the extracted modes. The multitaper F-test enables fast and accurate extraction of the properties of gravity modes with quasi-infinite lifetimes, preferentially selecting modes that exhibit purely periodic behaviour. Although the method typically extracts fewer frequencies than conventional prewhitening, it recovers most known modes and, in some cases, reveals new ones. We also find evidence for gravity modes with long but finite lifetimes, and detect more than one period spacing pattern in some of the studied SPB stars. Overall, the multitaper F-test offers a more objective and statistically sound alternative to prewhitening. It scales efficiently to large datasets containing thousands of pulsators, and has the potential to facilitate mode identification and to distinguish between the different excitation mechanisms operating in SPB stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10014v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation of circumstellar material during double-white-dwarf mergers and the early excess emissions in Type Ia supernovae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yusuke Inoue, Keiichi Maeda, Takashi Nagao, Tatsuya Matsumoto<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to The Astrophysical Journal<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Early excess emission observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within $\sim1$ day of explosion provides a critical window into their progenitor systems. In the present study, we investigate formation of the circumstellar matter (CSM) in double white-dwarf (WD) mergers. We further study the interaction between the CSM and the SN ejecta. We first model the orbital evolution and super-Eddington mass transfer/ejection in the double WD systems. We then conduct hydrodynamical and light-curve (LC) simulations of the SN-CSM interaction, assuming a prompt SN Ia explosion in a context of the carbon-ignited violent merger (C-ignited VM). Our simulations show that at the moment of the merger, the binary system has the CSM distribution following $ρ_{\mathrm{CSM}}\simeq D(r/10^{14}\ \mathrm{cm})^{-3.5}\ (D\simeq 10^{-14}\text{--}10^{-13}\ \rm g\ cm^{-3})$. The simulated LCs reproduce the early flux excesses across optical to UV bands, as well as their color evolution, observed in the VM candidates, i.e., 03fg/02es-like SNe Ia. This supports that 03fg/02es-like objects originate from the VM explosions. We also discuss the case of the helium-ignited VM, which might be realized in some WD-WD mergers depending on the He content in the system. Focused here is the timing when the explosion is initiated, and we find that the explosion is initiated after the companion WD is, at least partially, tidally disrupted also in this case; we thus expect the formation of the CSM through the mass transfer phase also for the helium-ignited VM scenario.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10002v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Space-Based Time-Domain Revolution in Astrophysics <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daniel Huber<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 34 pages (excluding references), 12 figures; to appear in Volume 64 of Annual Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract), time-domain (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Space-based time-domain telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler/K2 and TESS have profoundly impacted astrophysics over the past two decades.

The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of "dark" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars.

To construct the Roman SN Hubble diagram, a strategy to obtain redshifts must be determined. While the nominal HLTDS will use only the Roman prism, in this work we consider the utility of the Roman grism observations from overlap with the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey for SNIa cosmology. We determine a galaxy grism redshift recovery rate by simulating dispersed grism images and measuring redshifts with the Grizli software, obtaining an $H$-band 50% redshift recovery at magnitude 20.61 and 90% recovery at magnitude 19.27. To estimate the total number of spectroscopic redshifts expected for Roman SN cosmology, we also consider a Roman prism SN redshift efficiency and a ground-based telescope redshift efficiency for host-galaxies. We apply these redshift efficiencies to SNIa catalog level simulations and predict that $\sim$6800 SNe will have a SN or host spectroscopic redshift. Second, we evaluate the size of potential systematics related to modeling the grism redshift efficiency by considering the impact of additional dependencies on stellar mass and host galaxy color. We estimate the largest potential size of this systematic to be 0.0066$\pm$0.002 and -0.0266$\pm$0.007, roughly 42.9 and 49.6% of the statistical uncertainty for $w_0$ and $w_a$ respectively.

When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\pm0.36{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $Λ$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09989v1" target="_blank"><h2>ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eric Putney, David Shih, Sung Hak Lim, Matthew R.

The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk.

In this paper we take advantage of HST's multi-wavelength coverage (F475W, F606W and F814W observations) with the addition of deep u-band imaging from Gran Telescopio de Canarias, to perform the most detailed study and estimation to date of the GC population of the ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-2019. The improved constraints provided by the combination of high spatial resolution and better coverage of the GC spectral energy distribution has allowed us to obtain a clean sample of GCs in this galaxy. We report a number of 33+-3 GCs in MATLAS-2019, supporting the previous lower estimates for this galaxy. The GC population of this galaxy is highly concentrated with ~80% of the GCs inside the effective radius (Re) of the galaxy and the GC half-number radius Re,GC is 0.7Re. Using the GC-Halo mass relation, we estimate a halo mass for MATLAS-2019 of (1.14+-0.1)x10**11 solar masses. The GC luminosity function and the distribution of effective radii of the GCs favour a distance to the galaxy of 20.0+-0.9 Mpc. In agreement with previous findings, we find that the distribution of GCs is highly asymmetric even though the distribution of stars in the galaxy is symmetric. This suggests that assumptions about the symmetry of the GC distribution may be incorrect when used to calculate the number of GCs with such low statistics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09981v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rhea-RT: Dynamical impact of Central Molecular Zone conditions on ISM properties and stellar feedback coupling <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\rm cell}=20$ M$_\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09984v1" target="_blank"><h2>Clues from $\mathcal{Q}$--A null test designed for line intensity mapping cross-correlation studies <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Debanjan Sarkar, Ella Iles, Adrian Liu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 27 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables.

Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09878v1" target="_blank"><h2>GFH-v2 Pipeline for Searches of Long-Transient Gravitational Waves from Newborn Magnetars <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sandhya Sajith Menon, Lorenzo Pierini, Pia Astone, Cristiano Palomba, Lorenzo Silvestri, Sabrina D'Antonio, Simone Dall'Osso, Francesco Safai Tehrani, Stefano Dal Pra, Gaetano Dinatale, Sergio Frasca, Dafne Guetta, Paola Leaci, Alessio Orlandi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 10 figures ( +1 figure in appendix)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper presents an enhanced methodology for searching long transient gravitational waves associated with a newborn magnetar using a strongly improved version of the generalized Frequency Hough Transform algorithm, called GFH-v2.

On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($Δ_{\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 > -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $Λ$CDM scenario, based on both $Δχ^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09744v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tachyonic dark energy- Constraints from current observations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ramanpreet Singh, Athul C N, H.

The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $φ$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{φ0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{φ0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{φ0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{φ0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{φ0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09660v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic-Ray Bath in a Past Supernova Gives Birth to Earth-Like Planets <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ryo Sawada, Hiroyuki Kurokawa, Yudai Suwa, Tetsuo Taki, Shiu-Hang Lee, Ataru Tanikawa<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, and Supplementary Materials.

The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09361v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring Machine Learning Regression Models for Advancing Foreground Mitigation and Global 21cm Signal Parameter Extraction <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anshuman Tripathi, Abhirup Datta, Gursharanjit Kaur<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in JOAA<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extracting parameters from the global 21cm signal is crucial for understanding the early Universe. However, detecting the 21cm signal is challenging due to the brighter foreground and associated observational difficulties. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various machine-learning regression models to improve parameter extraction and foreground removal. This evaluation is essential for selecting the most suitable machine learning regression model based on computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. We compare four models: Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The comparison is based on metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ scores. We examine their effectiveness across different dataset sizes and conditions, including scenarios with foreground contamination. Our results indicate that ANN consistently outperforms the other models, achieving the lowest RMSE and the highest $R^2$ scores across multiple cases. While GPR also performs well, it is computationally intensive, requiring significant RAM and longer execution times. SVR struggles with large datasets due to its high computational costs, and RFR demonstrates the weakest accuracy among the models tested. We also found that employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step significantly enhances model performance, especially in the presence of foregrounds.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09353v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mordehai Milgrom<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, gr-qc, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\approx 2πG$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\approx 2π\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08822v1" target="_blank"><h2>A search for successful and choked jets in nearby broad-lined Type Ic supernovae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tanner O'Dwyer, Alessandra Corsi, Sheng Yang, Shreya Anand, S.

Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z<=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate. These results refine our understanding of the continuum linking ordinary SNe Ic-BL, engine-driven explosions, and GRBs, and contribute to building a sample that will inform future multi-messenger searches for electromagnetic counterparts to high-energy neutrinos.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08663v1" target="_blank"><h2>Pulsars identified in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey at 144 MHz <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> G.

These identifications represent the majority ($\geq$ 86%) of radio pulsars present in the LoTSS DR2 footprint and provide independent celestial positions and flux densities at 144 MHz. We compare LoTSS flux densities with literature values from various image and time-domain observations and find good agreement for all but two pulsars. We attribute these flux density deviations to intrinsic pulsar properties (nulling and off-pulse emission). We investigate criteria to select promising pulsar candidates using data from the upcoming LoTSS release of the entire Northern sky ($δ>0^\circ$), as well as the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) at 54 MHz (covering $δ>24^\circ$). Of the 80 detections, 35 (44%) were blindly redetected based on their linear or circular polarization. Therefore we conclude that candidate selection based on polarization properties is a promising approach. Candidate selection can be supplemented with spectral indices via cross-matching to LoLSS sources at 54 MHz, as the high sensitivity of LoTSS is not matched by image-domain surveys at higher frequencies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08528v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Photons in the Early Universe: From Thermal Production to Cosmological Constraints <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xun-Jie Xu, Boting Zhou<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, hep-ex<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages,6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-09<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dark photons, a generic class of light gauge bosons that interact with the Standard Model (SM) exclusively through kinetic mixing, arise naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4πe/27\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08413v1" target="_blank"><h2>Photochemistry of interstellar ice forming Complex Organic Molecules <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guillermo M.

The outcomes of such collisions vary depending on the mass and type of the WD. We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD. Our results indicate that such conditions can be realized in the case of low-mass CO-WDs and low-mass ONe-WDs, provided that the viscous coefficient is sufficiently large.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08212v1" target="_blank"><h2>Supernovae Shock Breakout from Red Supergiants in Two Dimensions <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Wun-Yi Chen, Ke-Jung Chen, Keiichi Maeda, Masaomi Ono, Po-Sheng Ou, F.

Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, which are much dimmer and longer than those from blue supergiants. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \sim 1.69\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\sim}$10-30\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\odot}$ model with $E \sim 1.09\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07945v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the missing dust of super-early galaxies: Supernova blowout and gas-dust venting in Blue Monsters <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sergio Martínez-González, Santiago Jiménez, Casiana Muñoz-Tunón<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, 2 figures.

We seek to understand the possible reason behind the apparent absence of dust in the Blue Monsters. We show how clustered supernovae drive mechanical blowout in stratified, self-gravitating clouds by combining full 3-D hydrodynamical dust-survival yields with 3-D thin-shell scalings, and we predict the retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the cluster scale and the corresponding galaxy-integrated value. We take the net dust yield per unit stellar mass from existing 3-D hydrodynamical studies of young stellar clusters with sequential supernovae, and we set the blowout radius as a function of gas concentration using established 3-D thin-shell scalings. Assuming gas-dust coupling across the blowout boundary, the retained dust-to-stellar ratio accounts for the fraction of supernovae that remain confined versus those that vent mechanically. Across typical cluster masses, sizes, and cloud-scale star formation efficiencies, mechanical venting removes a large share of gas and dust. The retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lowered by about half to two orders of magnitude relative to the supernova net dust yield. The outcome depends mainly on gas concentration and only weakly on metallicity, so it remains effective at low $Z$. After weighting by a Schechter cluster mass function and a Weibull core-radius distribution, the galaxy-integrated value falls in the same range inferred for spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monsters. Thus, mechanical venting at the cluster scale can account for the very low dust fractions inferred for Blue Monsters without requiring extreme in situ destruction and without fine-tuning.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07936v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the Type IIn SN 2025cbj coincidence with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-250421A <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

The origin of the astrophysical high-energy neutrino flux remains uncertain. Core-collapse supernovae with strong CSM interaction (Type IIn) are compelling candidates for efficient hadronic acceleration and neutrino production. Aims. We investigate the possible association between the Type IIn supernova SN2025cbj and the IceCube high-energy neutrino IceCube-250421A, and assess whether the observed properties of the SN permit an appreciable neutrino yield. Methods. We combined rapid optical follow-up with LAST and archival ZTF photometry with spectroscopy from LT/SPRAT and MMT/BINOSPEC to characterize the SN evolution and CSM interaction. We estimated the explosion and peak times from early light-curve fitting, and quantified the chance-coincidence probability with resampling simulations that scramble neutrino right ascensions while preserving declinations and error contours. Using a simple post-shock-breakout interaction model in a dense wind, we estimated the expected muon-neutrino yield for IceCube real-time Bronze stream. Results. Spectra of SN2025cbj obtained after the neutrino epoch show persistent narrow Balmer lines superposed on broad Lorentzian electron-scattering wings, consistent with sustained dense-CSM interaction. For the multi-messenger association, resampling simulations against the TNS catalog give a chance-coincidence probability for observing $k \ge 1$ events of $p \simeq 0.24$ (and $p \simeq 0.078$ against the ZTF-BTS catalog). These values are sensitive to the size of the SNe and neutrino samples. A post-breakout interaction scenario predicts an expected $N_{ν_μ} \sim 10^{-3}$ events in the IceCube Bronze alert stream over 76 days per this one candidate.
