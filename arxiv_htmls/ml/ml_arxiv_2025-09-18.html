  networks: a novel approach for converting 1D signals to unified 2D images</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yasin Hasanpoor, Bahram Tarvirdizadeh, Khalil Alipour, Mohammad Ghamari</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages 7 images 2 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract), multimodal (title, abstract), data augmentation (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This study introduces a novel method that transforms multimodal physiological
signalsphotoplethysmography (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and
acceleration (ACC) into 2D image matrices to enhance stress detection using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional approaches that
process these signals separately or rely on fixed encodings, our technique
fuses them into structured image representations that enable CNNs to capture
temporal and cross signal dependencies more effectively. This image based
transformation not only improves interpretability but also serves as a robust
form of data augmentation. To further enhance generalization and model
robustness, we systematically reorganize the fused signals into multiple
formats, combining them in a multi stage training pipeline. This approach
significantly boosts classification performance. While demonstrated here in the
context of stress detection, the proposed method is broadly applicable to any
domain involving multimodal physiological signals, paving the way for more
accurate, personalized, and real time health monitoring through wearable
technologies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13633v1" target="_blank"><h2>DeepLogit: A sequentially constrained explainable deep learning modeling
  approach for transport policy analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jeremy Oon, Rakhi Manohar Mepparambath, Ling Feng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract), convolutional (abstract), explainable (title), transformer (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Despite the significant progress of deep learning models in multitude of
applications, their adaption in planning and policy related areas remains
challenging due to the black-box nature of these models. In this work, we
develop a set of DeepLogit models that follow a novel sequentially constrained
approach in estimating deep learning models for transport policy analysis. In
the first step of the proposed approach, we estimate a convolutional neural
network (CNN) model with only linear terms, which is equivalent of a
linear-in-parameter multinomial logit model. We then estimate other deep
learning models by constraining the parameters that need interpretability at
the values obtained in the linear-in-parameter CNN model and including higher
order terms or by introducing advanced deep learning architectures like
Transformers. Our approach can retain the interpretability of the selected
parameters, yet provides significantly improved model accuracy than the
discrete choice model. We demonstrate our approach on a transit route choice
example using real-world transit smart card data from Singapore. This study
shows the potential for a unifying approach, where theory-based discrete choice
model (DCM) and data-driven AI models can leverage each other's strengths in
interpretability and predictive power. With the availability of larger datasets
and more complex constructions, such approach can lead to more accurate models
using discrete choice models while maintaining its applicability in planning
and policy-related areas. Our code is available on

Bevins, E. de Lera Acedo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 8 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract), anomaly detection (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires robust quality
control of large, heterogeneous datasets. Current data processing often relies
on manual, subjective rejection of photometric data, a practice that is not
scalable for forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a Bayesian framework that automates
this step by integrating anomaly detection directly into the light curve
fitting process. While the framework is model-agnostic and compatible with any
spectral energy distribution (SED) model, here we demonstrate its application
with the SALT3 model, implemented fully on GPU using \texttt{JAX-bandflux} for
computational efficiency. Our method models the probability of each photometric
measurement being anomalous with respect to the model, simultaneously inferring
the physical supernova parameters and each data point's posterior probability
of being a contaminant. Applying this framework to the Hawaii Supernova Flows
dataset, we demonstrate its three principal capabilities: (i) robust mitigation
of isolated outliers; (ii) automated identification and rejection of entirely
corrupted bandpasses; and (iii) preservation of valid data by flagging only
specific anomalous points within otherwise usable filters. We also find that
contaminants are systematically brighter and bluer, which if uncorrected could
bias subsequent cosmological inference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13842v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulation-based Inference of Massive Black Hole Binaries using

Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs), leveraging normalizing flows to
approximate the likelihood function. By training these flows on simulated data,
we can generate posterior samples via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with a
relatively reduced computational cost. Our method enables iterative refinement
of smaller models targeting specific MBHB events, with significantly fewer
waveform template evaluations. However, dimensionality reduction is crucial to
make the method computationally feasible: it dictates both the quality and time
efficiency of the method. We present initial results for a single MBHB with
Gaussian noise and aim to extend our work to increasingly realistic scenarios,
including waveforms with higher modes, non-stationary noise, glitches, and data
gaps.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13805v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards a Physics Foundation Model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Florian Wiesner, Matthias Wessling, Stephen Baek</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a
``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model
adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics
Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to
high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating
the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine
learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and
require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics
Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that
demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key
insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from
context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock
waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the
underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior
performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized
architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen
physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term
predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model
can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens
the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and
engineering.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13735v1" target="_blank"><h2>State Space Models over Directed Graphs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Junzhi She, Xunkai Li, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), transformer (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the
directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing
GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major
challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived
from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when
processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models
(SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their
variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while
maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However,
existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected
graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end,
we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed
graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state
space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we
develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that
implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing
mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning
tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with
1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing
state-of-the-art models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13390v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Domain Knowledge Informed Approach for Anomaly Detection of Electric
  Vehicle Interior Sounds</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Deepti Kunte, Bram Cornelis, Claudio Colangeli, Karl Janssens, Brecht Van Baelen, Konstantinos Gryllias</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.AS, I.2.1; I.2.6; I.2.10; I.5.1; I.5.2; J.2; J.7</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to: Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for
ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world
settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning
problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence
of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained
exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal
behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and
the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation
reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant
challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach
for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through
structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set
to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a
high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin
sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation,
Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced
sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been
made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental
evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models
using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection
strategies.</p></br></body>
