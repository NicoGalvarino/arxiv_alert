array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through
the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise
framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on
realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and
stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence
estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of
magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional
single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the
potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while
preserving the quality of the inference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01584v1" target="_blank"><h2>$\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm Absorption Spectra Classification using
  Machine Learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Debasish Mondal, Anirudh S. Nemmani, Arunima Banerjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, 2 appendices. Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> atomic hydrogen (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption, an extremely useful tool to study the
cold atomic hydrogen gas, can arise either from the intervening galaxies along
the line-of-sight towards the background radio source or from the radio source
itself. Determining whether $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines
detected as part of large, blind surveys are `intervening' or `associated'
using optical spectroscopy would be unfeasible. We therefore investigate a more
efficient, machine learning (ML)-based method to classify $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$
21-cm absorption lines. Using a sample of 118 known $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm
absorption lines from the literature, we train six ML models (Gaussian naive
Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM and XGBoost) on
the spectral parameters obtained by fitting the Busy function to the absorption
spectra. We found that a random forest model trained on these spectral
parameters gives the most reliable classification results, with an accuracy of
89%, a $F_1$-score of 0.9 and an AUC score of 0.94. We note that the linewidth
parameter $w_{20}$ is the most significant spectral parameter that regulates
the classification performance of this model. Retraining this random forest
model only with this linewidth and the integrated optical depth parameters
yields an accuracy of 88%, a $F_1$-score of 0.88 and an AUC score of 0.91. We
have applied this retrained random forest model to predict the type of 30 new
$\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines detected in recent blind surveys,
viz. FLASH, illustrating the potential of the techniques developed in this work
for future large $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01811v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei Using Hydrodynamic
  Simulations and Machine Learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sanaea C. Rose, James C. Lombardi, Jr., Elena González Prieto, Fulya Kıroğlu, Frederic A. Rasio</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional
environments in the Universe. A typical nuclear star cluster harbors a
supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds
($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside.
Direct collisions occur frequently in such high-density environments, where
they can shape the stellar populations and drive the evolution of the cluster.
We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at
impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to
develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision
outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the
literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of
"hit-and-run" collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change
in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters,
while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for
periapses $\gtrsim0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test
two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks,
for predicting collision outcomes and properties. We find that the neural
network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and
in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that
both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense
stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter
space of initial conditions expands.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02328v1" target="_blank"><h2>ASTROFLOW: A Real-Time End-to-End Pipeline for Radio Single-Pulse
  Searches</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Guanhong Lin, Dejia Zhou, Jianli Zhang, Jialang Ding, Fei Liu, Xiaoyun Ma, Yuan Liang, Ruan Duan, Liaoyuan Liu, Xuanyu Wang, Xiaohui Yan, Yingrou Zhan, Yuting Chu, Jing Qiao, Wei Wang, Jie Zhang, Zerui Wang, Meng Liu, Chenchen Miao, Menquan Liu, Meng Guo, Di Li, Pei Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 14 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright, millisecond duration cosmic
transients of unknown origin. The growing number of wide-field and
high-time-resolution radio surveys, particularly with next-generation
facilities such as the SKA and MeerKAT, will dramatically increase FRB
discovery rates, but also produce data volumes that overwhelm conventional
search pipelines. Real-time detection thus demands software that is both
algorithmically robust and computationally efficient. We present Astroflow, an
end-to-end, GPU-accelerated pipeline for single-pulse detection in radio
time-frequency data. Built on a unified C++/CUDA core with a Python interface,
Astroflow integrates RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum
tiling, and a YOLO-based deep detector. Through vectorized memory access,
shared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism, it achieves 10x
faster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for a typical 150 s,
2048-channel observation, while preserving high sensitivity across a wide range
of pulse widths and dispersion measures. These results establish the
feasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack,
capable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale
surveys. Astroflow offers a reusable and deployable solution for real-time
transient discovery, and provides a framework that can be continuously refined
with new data and models.</p></br></body>
