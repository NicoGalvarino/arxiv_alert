  and Lens Mass with Score-Based Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gabriel Missael Barco, Ronan Legin, Connor Stone, Yashar Hezaveh, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific
inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior
inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged
observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution
(and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly
inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based
on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions
yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal
posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias.
To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint
source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04254v1" target="_blank"><h2>3D Non-LTE radiation transfer: theory and applications to stars,
  exoplanets, and kilonovae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Maria Bergemann, Richard Hoppe</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Invited review for Living Reviews in Computational Astrophysics (LRCA), under review, 143 pages, constructive comments and suggestions welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Most of the physical information about astrophysical objects is obtained via
the analysis of their electromagnetic spectra. Observed data coupled with
radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars,
planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas
flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of
the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as
the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of
radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems
revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major
complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a
number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview
of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological
advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE
radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical
environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of
kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</p></br></body>
