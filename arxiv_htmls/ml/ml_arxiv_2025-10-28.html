  + CH in the ISM</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Moritz Bensberg, Silvia Alessandrini, Mattia Melosso, Cristina Puzzarini, Markus Reiher</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, physics.chem-ph, physics.comp-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Quantum chemistry provides accurate and reliable methods to investigate
reaction pathways of reactive molecular systems relevant to the interstellar
medium. However, the exhaustive exploration of a reactive network is often a
daunting task, resulting in unexplored reactive channels that affect kinetic
outcomes and branching ratios. Here, an automated workflow for exploring
reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs) is employed for the first time to
study the oxirane (C$_2$H$_4$O) plus methylidyne ($^.$CH) reaction. The
ultimate goal is to comprehensively map its PES and, subsequently, derive rate
constants for the most important reaction channels. In addition to its
astrochemical relevance, this reaction has been considered because it is a
challenging test case, its network being very extended, with 60 exothermic
bimolecular products lying below the reactant's energy. Kinetic simulations
indicate that the main product of the reaction is the HCO radical plus ethene
(C$_2$H$_4$), while formation of s-trans-propenal (acrolein) and 2H-oxene is
also possible, but to a lesser extent. Based on the present study and other
references in the literature, we suggest that the slightly higher relative
abundance of s-trans-propenal compared to methyl ketene in the interstellar
medium is a gas-phase kinetic effect, s-trans-propenal being a more easily
accessible product on the C$_3$H$_5$O$^.$ PES.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22250v1" target="_blank"><h2>K-DRIFT: Unveiling New Imagery of the Hidden Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jongwan Ko, Woowon Byun, Kwang-Il Seon, Jihun Kim, Yunjong Kim, Daewook Kim, Seunghyuk Chang, Dohoon Kim, Il Kweon Moon, Hyuksun Kwon, Yeonsik Kim, Kyohoon Ahn, Gayoung Lee, Yongseok Lee, Sangmin Lee, Sang-Mok Cha, Dong-Jin Kim, Kyusu Park, Jaewon Yoo, Jae-Woo Kim, Jihye Shin, Sang-Hyun Chun, Yongmin Yoon, Jaehyun Lee, Kyungwon Chun, Jinsu Rhee, Sungryong Hong, Jongyeob Park, Young-Beom Jeon, Eon-Chang Sung, Hong Soo Park, Seonwoo Kim, GyeongGon Bahk, Seri Yeon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publications in JKAS; 14 pages, 9 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures play a crucial role in understanding
galaxy evolution by providing significant insights into galaxy interactions,
the histories of mass assembly, and the distribution of dark matter.
Nevertheless, their inherently faint nature, coupled with observational
difficulties such as stray light interference and variations in the sky
background, has significantly impeded comprehensive studies of LSB features.
The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) project aims to address
these observational challenges by developing off-axis freeform three-mirror
telescopes and observational strategies specifically designed for LSB imaging
surveys. The first generation of the K-DRIFT (K-DRIFT G1) has been successfully
completed, and the forthcoming survey, scheduled to commence shortly, is
expected to yield novel insights into the LSB universe. This paper outlines the
scientific motivations of the project, discusses the technical challenges
encountered, highlights the innovative solutions devised, and describes the
future trajectory of the K-DRIFT.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22900v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MDW Hα Sky Survey: Data Release 1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Noor Aftab, Xunhe, Zhang, Sean Walker, Dennis di Cicco, David R.

autonomously-operated all-sky narrow-band (3nm) H$\alpha$ imaging survey. The
survey was founded by amateur astronomers and the northern sky (Decl. $\geq$
0$^\circ$) is presented here in its second stage of refinement for academic
use. Each 3.6$\times$3.6 sq. deg MDW field has 12 20-minute individual
exposures with a pixel scale of 3.6", a typical PSF of 6", and a stack point
source depth of 16-17 magnitudes. The northern MDW Survey Data Release 1 (DR1)
includes: calibrated and raw mean and individual images, star-removed mean
fields, and point source catalogs for all images matched to Data Release 1 of
the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the
INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS). Our initial study of H$\alpha$ filament
widths finds a typical FWHM of 30-45" in the Lyra region. The matched catalogs
(with a median match distance of ~0.5"), combined with our distinctive
narrow-band photometry, are used to identify H$\alpha$ variable and excess
sources. These initial studies highlight some of the many scientific uses of
the MDW H$\alpha$ survey.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21930v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing Low-Latency Sky Localization in Multi-Detector

Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Low-latency analyses of gravitational-wave (GW) data from LIGO, Virgo, and
KAGRA enable rapid detection of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and prompt
sky localization, essential for electromagnetic follow-up in multi-messenger
astronomy. We evaluate the performance and limitations of low-latency sky
localization using BAYESTAR algorithm, and investigate the impact of
low-significance Virgo triggers. We inject simulated CBC signals into
Gaussian-stationary noise and into Virgo data from the second part of the third
LIGO-Virgo observing run (O3b), then reconstruct skymaps across multiple
detector network configurations. Localization accuracy is assessed using
Percentile-Percentile plots, the Jaccard index, and the Kullback-Leibler
divergence. Binary neutron star mergers are statistically consistent with ideal
calibration, showing deviations below 3$\sigma$, particularly when Virgo is
included in the network, whereas skymaps for neutron star--black hole and
binary black hole mergers tend to be overconfident. Adding a third detector
generally improves accuracy, but the searched area can degrade when Virgo's
signal-to-noise ratio is low (SNR $\leq$ 5). For high-SNR events, relying on
two detectors can mislocalize the source. Excluding Virgo can therefore cause
the HL skymap to miss the true location when Virgo has strong antenna response,
in such cases a three-detector configuration is required to recover the correct
position and avoid misleading multi-messenger follow-up. We introduce
diagnostics to flag problematic skymaps and apply them to O3 public alerts,
recovering simulation-predicted trends and flagging a few anomalous
morphologies. The results are relevant for improving rapid vetting of GW alerts
and guiding observational strategies in multi-messenger astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22523v1" target="_blank"><h2>Refined Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating
  Axions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zi-Miao Huang, Changqian Li, Zuowei Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 17 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The supernova (SN) core, characterized by its extreme temperature and
density, serves as a unique laboratory for new-physics searches. Low-energy
supernovae (LESNe) provide particularly powerful probes, as their low explosion
energies place stringent limits on any additional energy deposition in the
mantle by new particles. We present refined LESN constraints on
lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) with
electron-muon couplings. We consider four production channels in the SN: muon
decay, lepton bremsstrahlung, electron-muon coalescence, and semi-Compton
scattering, the last of which is investigated here for the first time in the
context of LFV-ALPs. We find that muon decay dominates in the low-mass regime,
electron-muon coalescence in the high-mass regime, and semi-Compton scattering
in the intermediate-mass range. To derive accurate limits, we compute both the
energy transfer from the SN core to the mantle and the energy loss due to ALP
production in the mantle, which can be substantial for both large and small
couplings -- the latter case, to our knowledge, not previously noted in the
literature. We find that LESNe provide the most stringent constraints on the
parameter space for ALP masses above $\sim 110$ MeV. These refined results
strengthen previous SN bounds and highlight the exceptional sensitivity of
LESNe to LFV new physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22412v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multivariate Time Series Classification of Fermi-Detected Gamma-Ray
  Transients Using Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Arpan Aryam John, Krushna Govind Shete, Shabnam Iyyani, Saptarshi Bej</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 11 Figures, under review</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (title, abstract), neural network (title, abstract), DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected a diverse range of gamma-ray
transients since its launch in 2008. Over the years, Fermi has accumulated an
extensive public archive of transient events. Traditional classification
methods for these events typically rely on fixed thresholds, localisation
accuracy, and characteristic light curve features. However, in the current era
of time-critical, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger astronomy, rapid and
reliable classification is essential to enable timely follow-up and coordinated
observations. In this work, we develop and present two deep learning-based
classifiers that integrate convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures. Using multivariate time-series inputs derived from Fermi-GBM
data, our models are trained to distinguish among four classes of gamma-ray
transients: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs),
Solar Flares (SFLAREs), and Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). Furthermore, the
models are designed to flag events that do not conform to any of these
categories, providing a pathway for identifying potentially new or rare
transient types. Training was conducted using a carefully curated subset of
high-confidence Fermi events. The resulting models achieve an overall
classification accuracy of 93%, and identify approximately 2.5% of the triggers
as outliers of unknown origin. When applied to Fermi events with uncertain
classifications, our models assign 60% of them to the TGF category with over
60% confidence. These results demonstrate that incorporating deep
learning-based classification into onboard or automated data pipelines can
significantly enhance transient identification, minimize misclassification, and
improve the discovery potential of new phenomena in future high-energy
astrophysics missions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23502v1" target="_blank"><h2>Separation of gain fluctuations and continuum signals in total power

Stutzer</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (abstract), time-domain (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We describe a time-domain technique for separating $1/f$ gain fluctuations
and continuum signal for a total power spectrometer, such as the CO Mapping
Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder instrument. The $1/f$ gain fluctuations of
such a system are expected to be common-mode across frequency channels. If the
instrument's system temperature is not constant across channels, a continuum
signal will exhibit a frequency dependence different from that of common-mode
gain fluctuations. Our technique leverages this difference to fit a
three-parameter frequency model to each time sample in the time-domain data,
separating gain and continuum. We show that this technique can be applied to
the COMAP Pathfinder instrument, which exhibits a series of temporally stable
resonant noise spikes that effectively act as calibrators, breaking the gain
degeneracy with continuum signals. Using both simulations and observations of
Jupiter, we explore the effect of a $1/f$ prior for the gain model. We show
that the model is capable of cleanly separating Jupiter, a bright continuum
source, from the gain fluctuations in the scan. The technique has two
applications to COMAP. For the COMAP observations performing line intensity
mapping (LIM), the technique better suppresses atmospheric fluctuations and
foregrounds than the COMAP LIM pipeline. For the Galactic COMAP observations,
which map Galactic continuum signals, the technique can suppress $1/f$ gain
fluctuations while retaining all continuum signals. This is demonstrated by the
latest COMAP observations of $\lambda$-Orionis, where our method produces far
cleaner maps than a destriper alone, typically reducing the noise power by a
factor of 7 on beam scales and up to 15 on larger scales.</p></br></body>
