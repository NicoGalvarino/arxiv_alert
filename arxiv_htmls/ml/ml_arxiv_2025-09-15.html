  Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gang Li, Tianjiao Chen, Mingle Zhou, Min Li, Delong Han, Jin Wan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Page 14, 5 pictures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (abstract), multimodal (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects
without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost.
However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting
the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB
images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that
leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images,
and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.
Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that
enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal
collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt
and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation
mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations
of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and
point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D
anomaly detection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09940v1" target="_blank"><h2>DyKen-Hyena: Dynamic Kernel Generation via Cross-Modal Attention for

information from multiple sources (e.g., language, video, and audio), the
potential for intent-irrelevant and conflicting information across modalities
may hinder performance from being further improved. Most current models attempt
to fuse modalities by applying mechanisms like multi-head attention to unimodal
feature sequences and then adding the result back to the original
representation. This process risks corrupting the primary linguistic features
with noisy or irrelevant non-verbal signals, as it often fails to capture the
fine-grained, token-level influence where non-verbal cues should modulate, not
just augment, textual meaning. To address this, we introduce DyKen-Hyena, which
reframes the problem from feature fusion to processing modulation. Our model
translates audio-visual cues into dynamic, per-token convolutional kernels that
directly modulate textual feature extraction. This fine-grained approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on the MIntRec and MIntRec2.0 benchmarks.
Notably, it yields a +10.46% F1-score improvement in out-of-scope detection,
validating that our method creates a fundamentally more robust intent
representation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10337v1" target="_blank"><h2>Why does your graph neural network fail on some graphs? Insights from

data, yet a principled understanding of why they succeed or fail remains
elusive. While prior works have examined architectural limitations such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, these do not explain what enables GNNs to
extract meaningful representations or why performance varies drastically
between similar architectures. These questions are related to the role of
generalisation: the ability of a model to make accurate predictions on
unlabelled data. Although several works have derived generalisation error
bounds for GNNs, these are typically loose, restricted to a single
architecture, and offer limited insight into what governs generalisation in
practice. In this work, we take a different approach by deriving the exact
generalisation error for GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting through
the lens of signal processing. From this viewpoint, GNNs can be interpreted as
graph filter operators that act on node features via the graph structure. By
focusing on linear GNNs while allowing non-linearity in the graph filters, we
derive the first exact generalisation error for a broad range of GNNs,
including convolutional, PageRank-based, and attention-based models. The exact
characterisation of the generalisation error reveals that only the aligned
information between node features and graph structure contributes to
generalisation. Furthermore, we quantify the effect of homophily on
generalisation. Our work provides a framework that explains when and why GNNs
can effectively leverage structural and feature information, offering practical
guidance for model selection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10408v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multimodal SAM-adapter for Semantic Segmentation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Iacopo Curti, Pierluigi Zama Ramirez, Alioscia Petrelli, Luigi Di Stefano</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications
in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced
substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain
vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and
adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that
integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,
providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we
present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed
method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into
SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong
generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating
auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM
SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We
evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,
where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze
modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard
subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms
competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the
effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding. The code

  Domain Adaptation for Fetal Sleep Stage Classification</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Weitao Tang, Johann Vargas-Calixto, Nasim Katebi, Nhi Tran, Sharmony B. Kelly, Gari D. Clifford, Robert Galinsky, Faezeh Marzbanrad</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> eess.SP, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 4 tables, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), domain adaptation (title), transfer learning (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Introduction: This study presents FetalSleepNet, the first published deep
learning approach to classifying sleep states from the ovine
electroencephalogram (EEG). Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and
laborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage
classification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation
associated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth
restriction).
  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal
cortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network
originally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG
using transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain
adaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.
  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full
fine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall
performance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming
baseline models.
  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep
learning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the
fetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier
functions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling
and distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be
acquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data.
FetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low
power, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10011v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA) Using CancelOut Layer

which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets
whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating
the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset
after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured
using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the
introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of
the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the
removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of
IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These
experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its
performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The
benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach.
Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution
of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a
pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal
direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the
dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by
working directly within the projection space identified by the network.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09794v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Modular and Multimodal Generative AI Framework for Urban Building

current approaches remain largely incompatible with biological computation.
Classical graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* require global state and
biologically implausible operations such as backtracing, while reinforcement
learning methods rely on slow gradient-based policy updates that appear
inconsistent with rapid behavioral adaptation observed in natural systems.
  We propose a biologically plausible algorithm for shortest-path computation
that operates through local spike-based message-passing with realistic
processing delays. The algorithm exploits spike-timing coincidences to identify
nodes on optimal paths: Neurons that receive inhibitory-excitatory message
pairs earlier than predicted reduce their response delays, creating a temporal
compression that propagates backwards from target to source. Through analytical
proof and simulations on random spatial networks, we demonstrate that the
algorithm converges and discovers all shortest paths using purely timing-based
mechanisms. By showing how short-term timing dynamics alone can compute
shortest paths, this work provides new insights into how biological networks
might solve complex computational problems through purely local computation and
relative spike-time prediction. These findings open new directions for
understanding distributed computation in biological and artificial systems,
with possible implications for computational neuroscience, AI, reinforcement
learning, and neuromorphic systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10025v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring Expert Specialization through Unsupervised Training in Sparse

dataset, comparing unsupervised expert routing against a supervised baseline
guided by ground-truth labels. Surprisingly, we find that unsupervised routing
consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance. The experts learn to
identify meaningful sub-categorical structures that often transcend
human-defined class boundaries. Through t-SNE visualizations and reconstruction
analysis, we investigate how MoE models uncover fundamental data structures
that are more aligned with the model's objective than predefined labels.
Furthermore, our study on the impact of dataset size provides insights into the
trade-offs between data quantity and expert specialization, offering guidance
for designing efficient MoE architectures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09899v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variational Neural Networks for Observable Thermodynamics (V-NOTS)</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Christopher Eldred, François Gay-Balmaz, Vakhtang Putkaradze</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 6 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract), attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Much attention has recently been devoted to data-based computing of evolution

many cases, the available data does not correspond to the variables that define
the system's phase space. We focus our attention on the important example of
dissipative dynamical systems. In that case, the phase space consists of
coordinates, momenta and entropies; however, the momenta and entropies cannot,
in general, be observed directly. To address this difficulty, we develop an
efficient data-based computing framework based exclusively on observable
variables, by constructing a novel approach based on the \emph{thermodynamic

and guarantees the non-decreasing entropy evolution. We show that our network

solvents because their physicochemical properties can be precisely tailored to
various applications. However, accurately predicting key thermophysical
properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the
limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a
data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender
system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse
experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first,
pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature
and pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and
anions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these
embeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In
this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity,
surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both
within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained
models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models
for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial
margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously
unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for
over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in
process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated
data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09747v1" target="_blank"><h2>D-CAT: Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer between Sensor Modalities for
  Unimodal Inference</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Leen Daher, Zhaobo Wang, Malcolm Mielle</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multi-modal (abstract), transfer learning (abstract), attention (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cross-modal transfer learning is used to improve multi-modal classification
models (e.g., for human activity recognition in human-robot collaboration).
However, existing methods require paired sensor data at both training and
inference, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments where full
sensor suites are not economically and technically usable. To address this, we
propose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns
modality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality
during inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature
extraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the
alignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the
classification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three
multi-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal
models. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from
high-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains
over uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source
modalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the
target model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor
inference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for
perception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for
cost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with
variable sensor availability). Code is available at

ramosa) to California's tomato industry, which supplies over 90 percent of U.S.
processing tomatoes. The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early
detection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,
environmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined
drone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep
learning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
to handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested
tomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages
determined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to
isolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with
79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating
later stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved
detection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all
growth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy
and 95.37 percent recall. These results demonstrate the strong potential of
temporal multispectral analysis and LSTM networks for early broomrape
detection. While further real-world data collection is needed for practical
deployment, this study shows that UAV-based multispectral sensing coupled with
deep learning could provide a powerful precision agriculture tool to reduce

lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally
combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original
encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain

degradation from sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts, yet
lack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures. We present an
information-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of
RL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.
Through analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic
control task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits
characteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and
actions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing
state entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention
to task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint
mutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during
early learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a
transition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately
actionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system
failures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad
collapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action
coupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts
action-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This
differential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation
experiments enables precise fault localization without architectural
modifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns
as both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the
foundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and
policy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09168v1" target="_blank"><h2>Adaptive Pareto-Optimal Token Merging for Edge Transformer Models in

framework for adaptive token merging, a novel mechanism that compresses
transformer representations at runtime by selectively merging semantically
redundant tokens under per-layer similarity thresholds. Unlike prior
fixed-ratio reduction, our approach couples merging directly to input
redundancy, enabling data-dependent adaptation that balances efficiency and
task relevance without retraining. We cast the discovery of merging strategies
as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverage Bayesian optimization to
obtain Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, inference cost, and
communication cost. On ImageNet classification, we match the accuracy of the
unmodified transformer with 30\% fewer floating-point operations per second and
under 20\% of the original communication cost, while for visual question
answering our method achieves performance competitive with the full LLaVA model
at less than one-third of the compute and one-tenth of the bandwidth. Finally,
we show that our adaptive merging is robust across varying channel conditions
and provides inherent privacy benefits, substantially degrading the efficacy of
model inversion attacks. Our framework provides a practical and versatile
solution for deploying powerful transformer models in resource-limited edge
intelligence scenarios.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10406v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multipole Semantic Attention: A Fast Approximation of Softmax Attention

softmax attention that combines semantic clustering with multipole expansions
from computational physics. Our method addresses the quadratic computational
complexity of transformers in the context length by clustering queries and keys
separately in their learned representation spaces, enabling a hierarchical
two-stage attention mechanism. Unlike prior clustering approaches that group
only keys or use unified clustering, we maintain separate clusterings that
respect attention's asymmetric treatment of these spaces. We augment
centroid-based (monopole) approximations with dipole corrections that capture
directional variance within clusters, preserving richer information during
training. The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention,
requiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural
modifications. Our approach achieves $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal
attention with $C$ clusters and $\mathcal{O}(NCD \log N)$ for causal attention.
On isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash
Attention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For
causal attention, we develop a hierarchical block decomposition that combines
exact local computation with efficient long-range approximation. In end-to-end
pretraining of a 30M parameter model on book-length texts with 16k context, we
achieve 12.2% runtime reduction with only 0.36% loss degradation, establishing
the viability of multipole approximations for efficient transformer
pretraining.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09078v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scalable extensions to given-data Sobol' index estimators</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Teresa Portone, Bert Debusschere, Samantha Yang, Emiliano Islas-Quinones, T. Patrick Xiao</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly
advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally
expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of
existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely
large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the
existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity
analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks,
which have $>10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all
input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing
methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support
nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not
amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index
estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process
input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices
that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show
that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can
introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample
sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We
also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and
runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which
process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two
application problems in neural network modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09219v1" target="_blank"><h2>Vejde: A Framework for Inductive Deep Reinforcement Learning Based on

graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09362v1" target="_blank"><h2>Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous
  Approximation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hanfei Zhou, Lei Shi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> math.NA, cs.LG, cs.NA, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry
complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by
differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous
approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a
constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property
that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate
any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an
error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for
$k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero
parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only
on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in
H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound,
proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of
parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound
introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and
pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These
complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on
manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network
architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's
low-dimensional geometry.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09960v1" target="_blank"><h2>Limited Reference, Reliable Generation: A Two-Component Framework for
  Tabular Data Generation in Low-Data Regimes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mingxuan Jiang, Yongxin Wang, Ziyue Dai, Yicun Liu, Hongyi Nie, Sen Liu, Hongfeng Chai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> over-sampling (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Synthetic tabular data generation is increasingly essential in data
management, supporting downstream applications when real-world and high-quality
tabular data is insufficient. Existing tabular generation approaches, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and fine-tuned Large
Language Models (LLMs), typically require sufficient reference data, limiting
their effectiveness in domain-specific databases with scarce records. While
prompt-based LLMs offer flexibility without parameter tuning, they often fail
to capture dataset-specific feature-label dependencies and generate redundant
data, leading to degradation in downstream task performance. To overcome these
issues, we propose ReFine, a framework that (i) derives symbolic "if-then"
rules from interpretable models and embeds them into prompts to explicitly
guide generation toward domain-specific feature distribution, and (ii) applies
a dual-granularity filtering strategy that suppresses over-sampling patterns
and selectively refines rare but informative samples to reduce distributional
imbalance. Extensive experiments on various regression and classification
benchmarks demonstrate that ReFine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 0.44 absolute improvement in R-squared for regression
and 10.0 percent relative improvement in F1 score for classification tasks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09128v1" target="_blank"><h2>Learning What Matters: Causal Time Series Modeling for Arctic Sea Ice
  Prediction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Emam Hossain, Md Osman Gani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted and presented at the AI4TS Workshop @ IJCAI 2025 (non-archival)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> causality (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09843v1" target="_blank"><h2>HGEN: Heterogeneous Graph Ensemble Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiajun Shen, Yufei Jin, Yi He, Xingquan Zhu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> The paper is in proceedings of the 34th IJCAI Conference, 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper presents HGEN that pioneers ensemble learning for heterogeneous
graphs. We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and
local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning,
particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework
ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based
optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN
uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for
later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key
components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of
different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more
informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a
correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding
matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner
diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher
regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous
networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art
competitors by substantial margin.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10245v1" target="_blank"><h2>Model-agnostic post-hoc explainability for recommender systems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Irina Arévalo, Jose L Salmeron</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.IR, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> explainability (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recommender systems often benefit from complex feature embeddings and deep
learning algorithms, which deliver sophisticated recommendations that enhance
user experience, engagement, and revenue. However, these methods frequently
reduce the interpretability and transparency of the system. In this research,
we develop a systematic application, adaptation, and evaluation of deletion
diagnostics in the recommender setting. The method compares the performance of
a model to that of a similar model trained without a specific user or item,
allowing us to quantify how that observation influences the recommender, either
positively or negatively. To demonstrate its model-agnostic nature, the
proposal is applied to both Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a widely used
deep learning-based recommender, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a
classical collaborative filtering technique. Experiments on the MovieLens and
Amazon Reviews datasets provide insights into model behavior and highlight the
generality of the approach across different recommendation paradigms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09751v1" target="_blank"><h2>Meta-Learning Reinforcement Learning for Crypto-Return Prediction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Junqiao Wang, Zhaoyang Guan, Guanyu Liu, Tianze Xia, Xianzhi Li, Shuo Yin, Xinyuan Song, Chuhan Cheng, Tianyu Shi, Alex Lee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (abstract), transformer (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Predicting cryptocurrency returns is notoriously difficult: price movements

we present Meta-RL-Crypto, a unified transformer-based architecture that
unifies meta-learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to create a fully

the agent iteratively alternates between three roles-actor, judge, and

additional human supervision. It can leverage multimodal market inputs and

leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09387v1" target="_blank"><h2>MetaLLMix : An XAI Aided LLM-Meta-learning Based Approach for

continually monitoring changes in disaster risk, limiting the ability of key
decision-makers to assess progress towards the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster
Risk Reduction 2015-2030. While numerous efforts have substantially advanced
the large-scale modeling of hazard and exposure through Earth observation and
data-driven methods, progress remains limited in modeling another equally
important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability.
To address this gap, we introduce Graph Categorical Structured Variational
Autoencoder (GraphCSVAE), a novel probabilistic data-driven framework for
modeling physical vulnerability by integrating deep learning, graph
representation, and categorical probabilistic inference, using time-series
satellite-derived datasets and prior expert belief systems. We introduce a
weakly supervised first-order transition matrix that reflects the changes in
the spatiotemporal distribution of physical vulnerability in two
disaster-stricken and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas: (1) the
cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community in Bangladesh and (2) the
mudslide-affected city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Our work reveals
post-disaster regional dynamics in physical vulnerability, offering valuable

imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated

multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.</p></br></body>
