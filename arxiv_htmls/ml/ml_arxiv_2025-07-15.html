  Causality Discovery in Multivariate Time Series</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Meriem Zerkouk, Miloud Mihoubi, Belkacem Chikhaoui</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (title, abstract), causality (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is
essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and
marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional
analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal
Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel
architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated
temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net
effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated
convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its
attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy
and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens
robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference
reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets
demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as
TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation
of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in
noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,
uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising
on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial
markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent
mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in
high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by
RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability
across diverse application domains</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09420v1" target="_blank"><h2>Domain Adaptation and Multi-view Attention for Learnable Landmark

Poster available online atthis https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), domain adaptation (title), attention (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09103v1" target="_blank"><h2>CoVAE: Consistency Training of Variational Autoencoders</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gianluigi Silvestri, Luca Ambrogioni</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> variational autoencoder (title, abstract), VAE (title, abstract), dimensionality reduction (abstract), latent space (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Current state-of-the-art generative approaches frequently rely on a two-stage
training procedure, where an autoencoder (often a VAE) first performs
dimensionality reduction, followed by training a generative model on the
learned latent space. While effective, this introduces computational overhead
and increased sampling times. We challenge this paradigm by proposing
Consistency Training of Variational AutoEncoders (CoVAE), a novel single-stage
generative autoencoding framework that adopts techniques from consistency
models to train a VAE architecture. The CoVAE encoder learns a progressive
series of latent representations with increasing encoding noise levels,
mirroring the forward processes of diffusion and flow matching models. This
sequence of representations is regulated by a time dependent $\beta$ parameter
that scales the KL loss. The decoder is trained using a consistency loss with
variational regularization, which reduces to a conventional VAE loss at the
earliest latent time. We show that CoVAE can generate high-quality samples in
one or few steps without the use of a learned prior, significantly
outperforming equivalent VAEs and other single-stage VAEs methods. Our approach
provides a unified framework for autoencoding and diffusion-style generative
modeling and provides a viable route for one-step generative high-performance
autoencoding. Our code is publicly available at

reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent
deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit
critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a
novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching
as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in
transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and
patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate
vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network
simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we
demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from
a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We
propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation
in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review
synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial
attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust
fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research
directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use
potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10132v1" target="_blank"><h2>Wavelet-Enhanced Neural ODE and Graph Attention for Interpretable Energy

sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of
renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a
neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential

transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of
time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the
Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections
to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through
wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly
captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated
across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity
transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this
architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various
forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal
dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP
analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09742v1" target="_blank"><h2>Causality-informed Anomaly Detection in Partially Observable Sensor
  Networks: Moving beyond Correlations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xiaofeng Xiao, Bo Shen, Xubo Yue</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract), causality (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume
of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due
to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to
detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal
sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system
while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been
proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider
only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,
although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on
interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which
is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we
introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for
partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating
causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves
faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the
trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for
anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor
placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current
implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various
reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world
causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09445v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fourier Basis Mapping: A Time-Frequency Learning Framework for Time
  Series Forecasting</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Runze Yang, Longbing Cao, Xin You, Kun Fang, Jianxun Li, Jie Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 6 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract), transformer (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for
time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis
functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the
frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine
basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing
Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series
length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and
overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping
(FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features
through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our
approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal
characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of
neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better
performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear,
MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model
architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and
interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model
time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several
techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking,
centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale
down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for
both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09287v1" target="_blank"><h2>Graph Neural Networks for Photon Searches with the Underground Muon
  Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ezequiel Rodriguez</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025).12 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title), attention (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Ultra-high-energy photons have long been sought as tracers of the most
energetic processes in the Universe. Several sources can contribute to a
diffuse photon flux, including interactions of cosmic rays with Galactic matter
and radiation fields, as well as more exotic scenarios such as the decay of
super-heavy dark matter. Regardless of their origin, the expected flux is
extremely low, making direct detection impractical and thereby requiring
indirect detection by extensive ground-based detector arrays. In this
contribution, we present a novel method for photon-hadron discrimination in the
energy range of $50$ to $300\,\text{PeV}$ based on deep learning algorithms.
Our approach relies on information from both the Surface Detector (SD) and the
Underground Muon Detector (UMD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD
consists of an array of water-Cherenkov detectors. It is used to measure the
electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers at ground level.
Meanwhile, the UMD is composed of buried scintillator modules. It is sensitive
to air-shower muons with energies above ${\sim}1\,\text{GeV}$, enhancing the
identification of muon-poor air showers as initiated by photon primaries. Our
method represents air-shower events as graphs, and consequently, the network
architecture is composed of graph attention layers. We assess the performance
of the method on a data subset and discuss the implications of unblinding the
full current dataset, as well as the prospects of the increasing data volume
expected in the coming years, particularly in terms of sensitivity to various
diffuse fluxes from theoretical predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08977v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulation as Supervision: Mechanistic Pretraining for Scientific

interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine
learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer
unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce
Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses
mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are
pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter
regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across
scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved
state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly
tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield
prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological
forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also
accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social
networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as
estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods
even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution,
a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs
retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most
similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active.
This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening --
not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep
learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming
simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision,
enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09826v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bridging Neural Networks and Dynamic Time Warping for Adaptive Time

classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for
training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they
lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast,
dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is
widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent
interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and
cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than
neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a
versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with
labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic
length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while
preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the
DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on
this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a
neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available,
while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to
several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it
significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and
remains competitive in rich-resource settings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08972v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating Three-dimensional Turbulence with Physics-informed Neural

solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully
simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly
learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional
computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic
innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and
advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning
chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence
problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics
including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our
results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic

accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its

driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and
efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal
synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle
temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream
MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different
models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced
sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while
object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a
single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to
88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy
(MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense
patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal
alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal
shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path
of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our
thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with
low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it
as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09961v1" target="_blank"><h2>Text-Driven Causal Representation Learning for Source-Free Domain

to generate style word vectors, combining them with class information to
generate text embeddings to simulate visual representations; second, it trains
a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract
domain-invariant features. Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a

asymmetrically treats temporal and spatial information regarding them as

To demonstrate its utility, we focus on clinical domains such as cancer,

mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor of the Milky Way from
astrometric data. Our approach is based on Stochastic Variational Gaussian
Process Regression (SVGPR) and provides an attractive alternative to binning
procedures. SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which
suffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently
distributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements
exhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity
dispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property
of the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean
velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes.
This achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M
<< N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data.
Applied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity
Survey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity
dispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find
asymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion
tensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a
state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit
correlated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as

recommendation, a graph neural network (GNN)- based advertisement
recommendation method is analyzed. Through multi-dimensional modeling, user
behavior data (e.g., click frequency, active duration) reveal temporal patterns
of interest evolution, ad content (e.g., type, tag, duration) influences
semantic preferences, and platform features (e.g., device type, usage context)
shape the environment where interest transitions occur. These factors jointly
enable the GNN to capture the latent pathways of user interest migration across
platforms. The experimental results are based on the datasets of three
platforms, and Platform B reaches 0.937 in AUC value, which is the best
performance. Platform A and Platform C showed a slight decrease in precision
and recall with uneven distribution of ad labels. By adjusting the
hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size and embedding dimension, the
adaptability and robustness of the model in heterogeneous data are further
improved.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10492v1" target="_blank"><h2>BenchReAD: A systematic benchmark for retinal anomaly detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chenyu Lian, Hong-Yu Zhou, Zhanli Hu, Jing Qin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> MICCAI 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at
https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09622v1" target="_blank"><h2>Millions of Main-Sequence Binary Stars from Gaia BP/RP Spectra</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiadong Li, Hans-Walter Rix, Yuan-Sen Ting, Johanna Müller-Horn, Kareem El-Badry, Chao Liu, Rhys Seeburger, Gregory M.

Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia
XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and
photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology
identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and
binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between
0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35
million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define
a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large,
homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties
across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star
formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to
distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with
dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates,
improving our understanding of compact object populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09213v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optimizing Basis Function Selection in Constructive Wavelet Neural
  Networks and Its Applications</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dunsheng Huang, Dong Shen, Lei Lu, Ying Tan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML, 68T07</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Wavelet neural network (WNN), which learns an unknown nonlinear mapping from
the data, has been widely used in signal processing, and time-series analysis.
However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high
computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a
constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing
new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the
first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select
appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by
estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel
constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis
increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving
computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary
time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The
framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating
unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets,
identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing
nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the
framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released
at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10056v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lightweight Model for Poultry Disease Detection from Fecal Images Using

remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09647v1" target="_blank"><h2>KEN: Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network for Multimodal

made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus.
However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of
images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual
information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without
tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we
propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On
the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding
and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a
comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the
retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and
limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class
differences between different emotional types of news through balanced
learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional
types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09890v1" target="_blank"><h2>Soft Graph Clustering for single-cell RNA Sequencing Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ping Xu, Pengfei Wang, Zhiyuan Ning, Meng Xiao, Min Wu, Yuanchun Zhou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, q-bio.GN</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent
graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks
(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of
high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to
ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph
constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents
challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary
edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of
continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information
loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard
graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,
potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering
outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph
Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately
characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge
weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC
framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative
binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed
soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering
optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that
scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,
cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its
substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our

Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace

the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain
abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM
autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level
play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a
meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space,
reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent

avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing

advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with
advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available
multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration.
We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the
essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale,

triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times,
difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature

have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale

improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the
potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both
positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with
weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and
efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance
of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive

from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual

combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
