Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05670v1" target="_blank"><h2>Polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observations with FoReRo2: Instrument overview and standard stars monitoring <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yanko Nikolov, Galin Borisov, Stefano Bagnulo, Plamen Nikolov, Rumen Bogdanovski, Tanyu Bonev<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics, 19 pages, 19 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this paper, we present a description and characterisation of the 2-Channel Focal Reducer Rozhen (FoReRo2), with an emphasis on its polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observation modes. FoReRo2 is a multimode instrument mounted at the Ritchey-Chretien(RC) focus of the 2-meter Ritchey-Chretien-Coude (RCC) telescope at the Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory (BNAO) - Rozhen. The primary targets of this instrument include novae, Be/X-ray binaries, symbiotic stars, asteroids, and comets.
  Standard stars with a high degree of polarisation are an essential part of the polarimetric observations. In our sample, HD 204827 shows short-term variability in position angle, making it unsuitable for calibration. HD 183143 displays intrinsic polarisation variability but remains stable in position angle. For the first time, we present a statistical study of K and λ_max of the Serkowski law, including their mean value, standard deviation, and distribution.
  In order to show the FoReRo2 polarimetric capabilities, we also present several examples. The recurrent nova RS Oph shows variability of Serkowski's K parameter due to dust formation within the first few days after the 2021 outburst. The examples also include imaging polarimetry of comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) and spectropolarimetric observations of the symbiotic star Z And.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05566v1" target="_blank"><h2>Machine and Deep Learning Regression for Compact Object Equations of State <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> I.

Traditional efforts have relied primarily on theoretical modeling grounded in nuclear and particle physics, with subsequent validation against empirical constraints from heavy ion collisions and, increasingly, multimessenger astrophysical observations. Recent developments, however, have introduced complementary analytical strategies that merge theoretical modeling with advanced data driven methodologies. In particular, Bayesian inference, machine learning, and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for constraining the EoS and extracting physical insight from complex observational datasets. In this work, we employ state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze mass radius relations of compact objects with the aim of reconstructing or inferring their underlying equations of state. The analysis is based on an extensive library of physically consistent, multimodal EoSs for neutron stars and a corresponding set for quark stars, each constructed to satisfy established theoretical and observational constraints. By leveraging the predictive capacity of these computational frameworks, we demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches to provide refined insights into the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities and to contribute to a more unified understanding of the dense matter EoS.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05458v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating Unusually Extended Main Sequence Turnoff of the Galactic Open Cluster NGC 3532 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Khushboo K Rao, Wen-Ping Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multi-modal (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extended main-sequence turnoffs are observed in the color-magnitude diagrams of some young and intermediate-age star clusters. Here we report the case study of NGC 3532. Among the cluster member candidates identified using the ML-MOC algorithm on Gaia DR3 sources, we found that fast rotators are significantly redder. Stars near the main-sequence turnoff exhibit a multi-modal distribution in the Gaia broadening velocity ($v_{\rm broad}$). A comparison with relevant literature suggests binaries being typically interspersed with fast rotators, often manifesting as slow to moderate rotators. Additionally, chemically peculiar stars are predominantly located in the bluer regions of the turnoff, with those in the fast-rotator region having large values of Gaia re-normalised unit weight error, indicating plausible companions. Our analysis suggests multiple channels responsible for angular momentum loss to account for the extended turnoff.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05220v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multiple outflows and delayed ejections revealed by early imaging of novae <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elias Aydi, John D.

Although most of the accreted envelope is expelled, the mechanism -- impulsive ejection, multiple outflows or prolonged winds, or a common-envelope interaction -- remains uncertain. GeV $γ$-ray detections from $>20$ Galactic novae establish these eruptions as nearby laboratories for shock physics and particle acceleration, underscoring the need to determine how novae eject their envelopes. Here we report on near-infrared interferometry, supported with multiwavelength observations, of two $γ$-ray detected novae. The images of the very fast 2021 nova V1674~Her, taken just 2--3 days after discovery, reveal the presence of two perpendicular outflows. The interaction between these outflows likely drives the observed $γ$-ray emission. Conversely, the images of the very slow 2021 nova V1405~Cas suggest a delay in the ejection of the bulk of the accreted envelope of more than 50 days after the start of eruption, as the nova slowly rises to visible peak and during which the envelope engulfed the system in a common envelope phase. These unprecedented images offer direct observational evidence that the mechanisms driving mass ejection from the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs are not as simple as previously thought, revealing multiple outflows and delayed ejections.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Albert Escrivà, Jaume Garriga, Shi Pi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages and 11 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $ζ[ζ_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $δN$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04946v1" target="_blank"><h2>MALLORN: Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dylan Magill, Matt Nicholl, Vysakh Anilkumar, Sjoert van Velzen, Xinyue Sheng, Thai Son Mai, Hung Viet Tran, Ngoc Phu Doan, Thomas Moore, Shubham Srivastav, David R.

Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04804v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with MUSE <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alessandro Veutro, Irene Di Palma, Marco Drago, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Robin van der Laag, Melissa López, Fulvio Ricci<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract), convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life can give rise to one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe. Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope. Among the three detector geometries considered here, the 2L with a relative inclination of $45^\circ$ is the one achieving the best results, thus being able to detect a Kuroda2016-like waveform with an efficiency above $90\%$ at 50 kpc.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04508v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chlorine and Potassium Enrichment in the Cassiopeia A Supernova Remnant <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> XRISM collaboration<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$σ$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04378v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mini-supernovae from white dwarf-neutron star mergers: Viewing-angle-dependent spectra and lightcurves <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yacheng Kang, Jin-Ping Zhu, Lijing Shao, Jiahang Zhong, Jinghao Zhang, Bing Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under final review at A&A after minor revisions, 14 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Unstable mass transfer may occur during white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) mergers, in which the WD can be tidally disrupted and form an accretion disk around the NS. Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation.
  We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using "mini-supernovae" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04327v1" target="_blank"><h2>A distance measurement for blazar TXS 0506+056 using its radio variability and very long baseline images <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chanwoo Song, Sang-Sung Lee, Sincheol Kang, Whee Yeon Cheong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> causality (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the results of constraining the angular diameter distance to blazar TXS 0506+056. We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $Λ$CDM model within 1$σ$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $Λ$CDM distance of $948.2\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $Λ$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04145v1" target="_blank"><h2>Minuet: A Diffusion Autoencoder for Compact Semantic Compression of Multi-Band Galaxy Images <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alexander T.

Rubin Observatory is slated to observe nearly 20 billion galaxies during its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z<1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04031v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large Language Models for Limited Noisy Data: A Gravitational Wave Identification Study <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yixuan Li, Yuhao Lu, Yang Liu, Liang Li, R.

We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $λ$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $θ$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03695v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ANDICAM-SOFI Near-infrared and Optical type Ia Supernova (ASNOS) sample: Description and data release <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kim Phan, Lluís Galbany, Tomás E.

While most of the effort has focused on increasing the number of SNe Ia observed in the optical, near-infrared (NIR) observations remain scarce despite their advantages, that is, reduced dust extinction and a more intrinsic standard candle behavior, requiring little to no empirical corrections. Here, we present ASNOS (ANDICAM-SOFI Near-infrared and Optical type Ia Supernova), a dataset with sample size of 1,482 epochs in the $BVRIYJH$ filters from the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3-meter SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, along with 125 $JHK$ epochs from the SOFI instrument on the 3.58-meter New Technology Telescope on the La Silla Observatory. Additionally, we incorporate optical forced photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The sample comprises 41 SNe Ia in total, including 29 normal events, eight 1991T-like objects, and four peculiar subtypes, all located at redshifts $z < 0.085$. This paper provides a detailed overview of the ASNOS sample selection, data reduction, SN photometry, host-galaxy spectral energy distribution construction, both global and local, and SN light-curve fitting using three methods: SALT3-NIR, SNooPy, and BayeSN. A companion paper will present the cosmological analysis.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03662v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational Decays of Secluded Scalars and Graviton Dark Radiation <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kazunori Nakayama, Fuminobu Takahashi, Juntaro Wada<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We discuss graviton dark radiation produced by the decay of a secluded scalar field that couples to the Standard Model (SM) only through gravity. Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03331v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio Detection of a Local Little Red Dot <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> L.

One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\pm$8 $μ$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\pm$3 $μ$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03329v1" target="_blank"><h2>Push-broom Mapping of Galaxies and Supernova Remnants with the SPRITE CubeSat <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elena Carlson, Brian Fleming, Yi Hang Valerie Wong, Briana Indahl, Dmitry Vorobiev, Maitland Bowen, Donal O'Sullivan, Kevin France, Anne Jaskot, Jason Tumlinson, Sanchayeeta Borthakur, Michael Rutkowski, Stephan McCandliss, Ravi Sankrit, John M.

The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03264v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparison of Ne-22 core and shell distilled WD detonations in AREPO <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Uri Pierre Burmester, Lilia Ferrario, Ivo R.

These simulations, conducted with the moving-mesh code AREPO, aim to investigate the effects of chemical separation on the ejecta and spectra of such WDs undergoing thermonuclear explosions. The distillation process alters the internal chemical stratification of the star, concentrating neutron-rich material either in a central core or in an interior shell. We model both configurations as well as a homogeneous equivalent for each case with the same $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$ content distributed evenly at all radii. Despite similar $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$ yields between the core and shell models ($0.40$ and $0.45 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ respectively), the two models yield markedly different iron-group abundances. Both distilled models showed significantly enhanced production of $^{15} \mathrm{N}$ via the decay of $^{15} \mathrm{O}$. The $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$-core model produces enhanced amounts of stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes such as $^{58} \mathrm{Ni}$ and $^{54} \mathrm{Fe}$. We highlight observational signatures associated with these differences, including potentially enhanced [$\mathrm{Ni}_{\rm II}$] lines in nebular spectra. Synthetic TARDIS spectra at early times show only moderate differences. Our results suggest that white dwarf distillation, a process linked to delayed cooling in the Gaia Q branch population, may leave detectable nucleosynthetic fingerprints in a subset of Type Ia supernovae. These findings open additional pathways to probe progenitor evolution and the role of crystallisation in shaping the diversity of thermonuclear transients.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03232v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: global zero-point and $H_0$ constraints <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

The primary purpose of this paper is to perform the calibration of the zero-point for the DESI Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, which allows us to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. This sample has a lower statistical uncertainty than any previously used to measure $H_0$, and we investigate the systematic uncertainties in absolute calibration that could limit the accuracy of that measurement. We improve upon the DESI Early Data Release Fundamental Plane $H_0$ measurement by a) using a group catalog to increase the number of calibrator galaxies and b) investigating alternative calibrators in the nearby universe. Our baseline measurement calibrates to the SH0ES/Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, and finds $H_0=73.7\pm 0.06\;(\text{stat.})\pm 1.1\;(\text{syst.})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Calibrating to surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances yields a similar $H_0$. We explore measurements using other calibrators, but these are currently less precise since the overlap with DESI peculiar velocity tracers is much smaller. In future data releases with an even larger peculiar velocity sample, we plan to calibrate directly to Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch, which will enable the uncertainty to decrease towards a percent-level measurement of $H_0$. This will provide an alternative to supernovae as the Hubble flow sample for $H_0$ measurements.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03228v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: Mock Catalog <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

We carefully match mock and data properties and we mimic measurements of distance indicators and peculiar velocities, which follow the same statistical properties as real data. Mock samples of type-Ia supernovae also complement the other two distance indicators. Our 675 available mock realizations were used consistently by our three different methodologies described in our companion papers that measure the growth rate of structure $fσ_8$ with DESI PV DR1. Those mocks allow us to perform precise tests of clustering models and uncertainty estimation to an unprecedented level of accuracy, and compute correlations between methodologies. The consensus value for the DESI DR1 PV growth rate measurement is $fσ_8 = 0.450 \pm 0.055$.

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02391v2" target="_blank"><h2>"SNe Ia twins" in the Hubble flow, and the determination of H0 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pilar Ruiz-Lapuente, Antonio Quintana-Estellés, Jonay I.

  Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method.
  We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP),
  contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$_{0}$
  from single SNe Ia.
  On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia.
  Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy.
  Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the
  Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of
  H$_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$.
  There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with
  the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors.

Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02125v1" target="_blank"><h2>A value-added catalogue of neural network-based europium abundances for GALAH DR4 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sarah G.

The stellar spectroscopic survey GALAH's unique wavelength range and setup include the Eu absorption feature at $\sim6645$ Å for almost a million stars in the most recent Data Release 4 (DR4). However, DR4 also saw a decreased precision in reported Eu measurements compared to previous data releases. In this work, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform label transfer, wherein we use the GALAH DR4 spectra and stellar parameters to infer DR3 [Eu/H] abundances. This CNN is then applied to DR4 spectra without corresponding DR3 Eu abundances to develop a new, publicly available catalogue of [Eu/H] values for high signal-to-noise targets. We include [Eu/H] predictions for $118\,946$ stars, out of which $54\,068$ giants constitute our "golden sample" of high-confidence predictions, which pass stricter quality cuts and have a reported precision $\lesssim0.1$. To overcome the scarcity of training data in the low metallicity regime, we provide an additional catalogue of [Eu/H] abundances for metal poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-1$) stars derived from synthesis of the Eu feature. Our "golden sample" can be combined with [Eu/H] values from GALAH DR3 to create a catalogue of over $100\,000$ vetted, high-quality abundances on a homogeneous scale.

We use KORG, a state of the art spectral synthesis package, to derive 1D-LTE abundances from high-SNR and high-resolution spectra taken by the Large Binocular Telescope with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument. These precise spectra and abundance measurements minimize the impact of photon-noise (<0.06 dex), allowing us to robustly measure the intrinsic abundance scatter in [X/Fe]. After removing two stars with exceptional s-process enhancement, we find that the intrinsic scatter among the s- and r-process elements tends to be larger than for the lighter elements, with heavy element scatter ranging from 0.11 (Zn) to 0.27 (Eu) dex. Intrinsic abundance scatter could have multiple origins, including star-to-star variations in the ratios of nucleosynthetic sources as well as stochastic sampling of the progenitor supernovae properties, such as mass, rotation, and magnetic field strength. We explore the expected abundance scatter signature caused by stochastic sampling, finding that a fraction of both rapidly rotating CCSN and magnetorotationally driven SN are needed to reach the observed abundances and intrinsic scatter. This analysis is limited by the restrictive parameter spaces spanned by existing yield sets. A diverse, finely sampled grid of supernovae yields is needed to robustly model stochastic abundance scatter.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 27 papers (0 new, 27 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
