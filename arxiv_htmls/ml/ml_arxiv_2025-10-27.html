campaign targeted Mrk 817 with intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and found
its soft X-ray emission to be strongly absorbed. We present results from 157
near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust
reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear
response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of $\sim 90$ light-days from
the blackbody dust temperature light-curve. This radius is consistent with
previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an
unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the
inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation,
rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition.
Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident
radiation, we derive a luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for
the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured
spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate
of $\dot{m} \sim 0.2$. Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured
lower luminosity disk with $\dot{m} \sim 0.1$, which permits the UV/optical
continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse
emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on
scales $> 140-350$ pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we
observe in spatially-resolved [SIII] $\lambda 9531$ images. Its likely origin
is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by
a nuclear starburst.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20896v1" target="_blank"><h2>Direct Measurement of Galaxy Assembly Bias using DESI DR1 Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhiwei Shao, Ying Zu, Andrés N.

measure the halo occupation distribution (HOD) by combining a state-of-the-art
group catalog with weak gravitational lensing. For groups binned by total
luminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\rm gal}$ from
group-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo
mass $M_h$. Applying this to a volume-limited sample at $z{\in}[0.05,0.2]$, we
measure the dependence of HOD, $N_{\rm gal}(M_h)$, on large-scale overdensity
$\delta_{g}$. Focusing on the satellite galaxies, we find an assembly bias
parameter of $Q_{\rm sat}{=}0.05{\pm}0.14$, a result consistent with zero and
in tension with many empirical galaxy formation models. Our method provides a
robust approach for characterizing galaxy assembly bias to achieve precision
cosmology with DESI and future Stage-V surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21097v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detecting Population III Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of EP and SVOM</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jun-Jie Wei, Qing-Bo Ma, Xue-Feng Wu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), putative counterparts of massive,
low-metallicity Population III (Pop III) stars, are a promising probe of the
first stars. We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a
metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical
simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing
on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein
Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the
Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Our
population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the
following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z>6$:
$\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and
$\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with
very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive
upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z>6$ of
$<0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and
$<0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence
of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z>5.5$. Our results
indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z<10$,
their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching
$\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z>10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z>16$ for
\emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in
the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of
$\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at
high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z>16$ is most
likely of Pop III origin.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21694v1" target="_blank"><h2>HOLISMOKES XIX: SN 2025wny at $z=2$, the first strongly lensed

associated with the lens candidate PS1 J0716+3821. Photometric monitoring from
the Lulin and Maidanak observatories confirms multiple point-like images,
consistent with SN 2025wny being strongly lensed by two foreground galaxies.
Optical spectroscopy of the brightest image with the Nordic Optical Telescope
and the University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope allows us to determine the
redshift to be z_s = 2.008 +- 0.001, based on narrow absorption lines
originating in the interstellar medium of the supernova host galaxy. At this
redshift, the spectra of SN 2025wny are consistent with those of superluminous
supernovae of Type I. We find a high ejecta temperature and depressed spectral
lines compared to other similar objects. We also measure, for the first time,
the redshift of the fainter of the two lens galaxies (the "perturber") to be
z_p = 0.375 +- 0.001, fully consistent with the DESI spectroscopic redshift of
the main deflector at z_d = 0.3754. SN 2025wny thus represents the first
confirmed galaxy-scale strongly lensed supernova with time delays likely in the
range of days to weeks, as judged from the image separations. This makes SN
2025wny suitable for cosmography, offering a promising new system for
independent measurements of the Hubble constant. Following a tradition in the
field of strongly-lensed SNe, we give SN 2025wny the nickname SN Winny.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21510v1" target="_blank"><h2>LEO Satellite Track Correction for CSST Multi-Band Imaging Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Huai-Jin Tang, Xiao-Lei Meng, Hu Zhan, Guo-Liang Li, Cheng-Liang Wei, Xian-Min Meng, Xi-Yang Fu, You-Hua Xu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Low Earth Orbit satellite (LEOsat) mega-constellations are considered to be
an unavoidable source of contamination for survey observations to be carried
out by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) over the next decade. This
study reconstructs satellite trail profiles based on simulated parameters,
including brightness levels and orbital altitudes, in combination with
multi-band simulated images. Compared to our previous work, the simulated
images in this study more accurately replicate the realistic observational
conditions of CSST and extend beyond single-band analysis. Variations in LEOsat
trail brightness, source brightness, background noise, and source density
across different bands result in differing levels of accuracy in trail
reconstruction and subsequently affect the reliability of photometric
measurements. The reconstructed trail profiles are subsequently applied to
correct the contaminated regions. Simulation results reveal varying levels of
contamination effects across different bands following LEOsat trail correction,
including both reconstruction and subtraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of
the correction, we quantified the fraction of affected sources using two
metrics: (1) magnitude errors greater than 0.01 mag attributable to LEOsats,
and (2) LEOsat-induced noise exceeding 10% of other noise contributions.
Following trail repair, the analysis reveals a reduction of over 50% in the
fraction of affected sources in the NUV band for both 550 km and 1200 km
altitudes, assuming a maximum brightness of 7 in the V band. In the i band, the
reduction exceeds 30%. The degree of improvement varies across spectral bands,
and depends on both satellite altitude and the adopted brightness model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21577v1" target="_blank"><h2>An observational study of rotation and binarity of Galactic O-type

surveys enable detailed characterization. The relative contributions of binary
supernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway
origin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way. We aim to
characterize the largest sample of Galactic O-type runaway stars ever
investigated through their kinematics, rotation, and binarity to shed light
into their origins. We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic
information to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational
velocities ($v \sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional
information about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic
binary nature. We also consider an additional sample of 65 double-lined (SB2)
spectroscopic binaries. We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type
runaways, most (74%) have $v \sin{i}<200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this
fraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast
rotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal
stars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate
faster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast
rotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS
dominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach
runaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D
velocities > 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while
runaways with 2D velocities > 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step
products. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that
most Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS
among fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity
ones. (Abridged)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21377v1" target="_blank"><h2>Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing

reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large

$3\sigma$ level. Our findings are further supported by the FLAMINGO and
MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly

galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation
histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach
links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the
cumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated,
self-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to
four isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies -- WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and
Leo P -- using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we
independently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and
metallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements,
finding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our
analysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries.
We then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from
the TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus
semi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best
reproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher
metallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar
feedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the
predicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times.
This work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically
motivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and
highlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal
retention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20911v1" target="_blank"><h2>Auger@TA: In-situ Cross-Calibration of the World's Largest Cosmic Ray

world's two largest ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) observatories. They
operate in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively, at similar
latitudes but with distinct surface detector (SD) designs. A significant
challenge in studying UHECR physics across the full sky is the apparent
discrepancy in flux measurements between the two experiments. This discrepancy
could arise from astrophysical differences and/or systematic effects related to
their detector designs and sensitivities to extensive air shower components. To
address this, the Auger@TA working group aims to cross-calibrate the two
observatories with a self-triggering micro-Auger array within the TA array.
This micro-array consists of eight Auger Surface Detector (SD) stations
equipped with Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) and AugerPrime Surface
Scintillator Detectors. Seven SD stations, configured with a centered-1-PMT
design, are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with one station in the center,
with 1.5 km spacing, mirroring the Auger layout. The eighth station, which
features a standard 3-PMT Auger station, is located in conjunction with a TA
detector at the center of the hexagon, forming a triplet for high-statistics
and low-uncertainty cross-calibration. A custom communication system that uses
readily available components enables seamless communication between stations
and remote access to each station through a central computer. The micro-array
is now fully deployed, and initial data-taking is about to start. This
presentation will detail the instrumentation, communication systems, central

semi-relativistic jets and super-critical accretion, and harboring a compact
object, likely a black hole. Despite decades of observation and modeling, the
precise nature of its progenitor binary remains uncertain. To estimate the
zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) properties of binaries that evolve into
SS\,433-like systems, we apply simulation-based calibration to Bayesian
inference and convolve a multivariate Gaussian likelihood constructed from six
measured binary parameters of SS\,433 with the isolated binary evolution model
\textsc{COSMIC}. Employing the dynamic nested sampler of \texttt{dynesty}, we
perform posterior inference over a ten-dimensional progenitor parameter space
defined by the masses, orbital parameters, mass transfer possibilities, and
natal kick velocity. We find that SS\,433-like systems arise from specific
regions of binary evolution parameter space depending on key assumptions, such
as the mass transfer rate and uncertainty taken from observations. Our
simulation-based calibration framework, implemented with a suite of machine
learning algorithms and scored by a heuristic reliability metric, allows us to
iteratively build posterior distributions of the progenitors of SS\,433-like
systems. This analysis reveals 90\% confidence intervals for the ZAMS primary

efficiency $(0.44, 0.76)$, accreted fraction in stable mass transfer $(0.22,
0.6)$, and black hole natal kick velocity magnitude $(5, 68)$ km/s. These

Despite growing interest, this remains a debated question, complicated by
limited observational constraints and differing implementations of CR physics
in simulations. While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and
dynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains
underexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped
cold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo.
Using high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find
that CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds.
Specifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface
area and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in
mass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the
central galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to
the no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass
in the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in
simulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal
gas. Our results demonstrate that CRs can play a critical role in regulating
the cold phase of the CGM contributed by satellites and therefore their ability
to feed galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20898v1" target="_blank"><h2>Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pau Amaro Seoane</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the
Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal
emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow
is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio
frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains
debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting
Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals
(XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the
tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the
observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of
grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation
model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent
viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics
of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration.
We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically
consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the
non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These
findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in
the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight
orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link
between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources,
alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI
systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests

and $\gamma_{lens}$ (the projected mass density profile slope), with consistent
mass-light ellipticity correlations in test and training data, we recover
$\theta_E$ with less than 1% bias per lens, 6.5% precision per lens and
$\gamma_{lens}$ with less than 3% bias per lens, 8% precision per lens. We find
that lens light subtraction prior to modeling is only useful when applied to
data sampled from the training prior. If emulated deconvolution is applied to
the data prior to modeling, precision improves across all parameters by a
factor of 2. Finally, we combine the inferred lens mass models using Bayesian
Hierarchical Inference to recover the global properties of the lens sample with
less than 1% bias.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21502v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-Messenger Search for Neutrino and Gravitational-Wave Emissions

are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical
point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment
could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to
gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN
accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger
rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH
masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present
a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our
innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino
observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying
potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of
the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino
Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident
detection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger

production, although their formation mechanisms are debated. Laboratory
experiments show that atomic C deposited onto interstellar ice analogs can
react with solid-phase NH3 to form a CHNH2 radical, a possible precursor to
COMs, including aminoketene (NH2CHCO). We used astrochemical kinetics models to
explore the role of the reaction of atomic C with NH3 and subsequent reaction
with CO in the formation of NH2CHCO and other COMs. We applied the three-phase
chemical model MAGICKAL to hot molecular core conditions from the cold-collapse
through to the hot-core stage. The chemical network was extended to include
NH2CHCO and a range of associated gas-phase, grain-surface, and bulk-ice
products and reactions. We also approximated conditions in a shocked cloud,
including sputtering of ice mantles. NH2CHCO is formed on grains at low
temperatures (~10 K) with a peak solid-phase abundance of ~2x10^-10 nH. Its
formation is driven by nondiffusive reactions, in particular the Eley-Rideal
reaction of C with surface NH3, followed by immediate reaction with CO. Surface
hydrogenation of NH2CHCO produces ethanolamine with a significant abundance of
~8x10^-8 nH. In the gas-phase, although ethanolamine reaches a modest abundance
peak immediately following its desorption from grains under hot-core
conditions, it is destroyed more rapidly due to its high proton affinity.
Molecular survival is much higher in the shocked regions, where these species
seem most likely to be detected. NH2CHCO is produced efficiently on simulated
interstellar grain surfaces, acting subsequently as an important precursor to
more complex organics, including ethanolamine and glycine. Ion-molecule
gas-phase destruction of NH3-bearing COMs is less efficient in shocked
lower-density regions, in contrast to hot cores, enhancing their abundances and
lifetimes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20466v2" target="_blank"><h2>The effect of triaxiality on the dynamics of triple supermassive black

often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic

shaping the dynamical evolution and the merger dynamics of their central SMBHs.
While binary SMBH evolution is well studied, the long-term dynamics of triple

We investigate the role of triaxiality in the evolution and dynamics of triple
SMBHs with initial conditions drawn from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation,
using high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We explore different
orbital configurations and host shapes, tracking the evolution from galactic
inspiral to hard binary formation at sub-parsec scales. In all cases, the two

few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable
attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$
framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members
of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to
general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential
astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation
on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and
gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry
followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate

for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe
discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those
of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius
A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the

especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is
generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations
are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading
to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to
investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense
regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes
beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform
multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas
with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results:
We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently
forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong
clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high
levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects
in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high
transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse
Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust
experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable
conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal
MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to
small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability -
like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density
enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure
hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in
protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21212v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modelling the scattering by porous aggregate dust grains in the

Murthy and Henry (2011) using GALEX observations. These halos are thought to be
caused by forward scattering of the starlight by dust grains present in thin
foreground clouds. The optical constants of grains producing such halos have
been constrained earlier by using a single scattering model, that considered
the Henyey-Greenstein empirical phase function instead of theoretical phase
functions for the scattering grains. In this work, we have modelled the FUV
halos for two stars, Spica and Achernar, by considering the realistic porous
aggregates of different sizes and compositions. As the Henyey-Greenstein phase
function is known to deviate from theoretical predictions, we have utilized
theoretical scattering phase functions for modelling. The dust is placed in a
double-layered plane-parallel sheet with its distance and optical depth varied
to get the best fit. We find that the halo intensities are dominated by
scattering due to 0.05 {\mu}m sized porous dust aggregates made of amorphous
silicate and carbonaceous aggregates for Spica and Achernar, respectively. We
find that the medium in front of Achernar has a lower optical depth ({\tau}) of
0.032 compared to Spica which has a value of {\tau} = 0.1. This low value is
close to the optical depth of the local ISM (0.01) within 40 pc of the Sun.
This study demonstrates an effective method to constrain the dust grain
properties in the local interstellar medium.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20697v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observationally derived change in star-formation rate as mergers

We can trace
when these changes occur in simulations of galaxy mergers. However, for
observed galaxies we do not know how the star-formation rate (SFR) evolves
along the merger sequence as it is difficult to probe the time before or after
coalescence. We aim to derive how SFR changes in observed mergers throughout
the merger sequence, from a statistical perspective. Merger times were
estimated for observed galaxy mergers in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) using a
convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on mock KiDS images
created using IllustrisTNG data. The SFRs were derived from spectral energy
density fitting to KiDS and VIKINGs data. To determine the change in SFR for
the merging galaxies, each merging galaxy was matched and compared to ten
comparable non-merging galaxies; matching redshift, stellar mass, and local
density. Mergers see an increase in SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the
merger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger
event. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers
begins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times
and SFRs to confirm this. We find that more galaxies with larger stellar mass
(M$_{\star}$) have greater SFR enhancement as they merge compared to lower
M$_{\star}$ galaxies. There is no clear trend of changing SFR enhancement as
local density changes, but the least dense environments have the least SFR
enhancement. The increasing SFR enhancement is likely due to closer proximity
of galaxies and the presence of more close passes as the time before merger
approaches 0~Myr, with SFR slowing 200~Myr after the merger event.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21480v1" target="_blank"><h2>The population of Galactic young massive star clusters in the TeV range</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rowan Batzofin, Pierre Cristofari, Kathrin Egberts</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 3 figures, Proceedings for the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Young massive star clusters (YMSCs) can produce gamma rays in the

  To address these questions, we simulate the population of YMSCs in the

achieve high-precision reconstruction of the CMB polarization signal, with the
most ambitious objective being the detection of primordial $B$ modes sourced by
cosmic inflation. Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate,
parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, is highly susceptible to
contamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component
separation. In this work, we introduce an agnostic, model-independent procedure
to construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the
observed angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of
foreground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using
the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These
maps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction,
yielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after
component separation. The power spectrum of this residual map, after proper
noise debiasing, is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological
likelihood, thereby enabling unbiased inference of cosmological parameters. We
validate the method on realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment,
focusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that
including the residual template in the likelihood yields unbiased estimates of
$r$, regardless of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the
adopted masking strategy, thus proving the robustness of the proposed
procedure. The pipeline has been made publicly available as part of the BROOM

Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme

supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as
unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications
to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established
schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification
statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and

this work, we explore SMBH-host relations in three state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations: Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Using a variety of machine
learning regressors, we measure the scaling relations between black hole mass
($M_{\rm BH}$) and galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion
($\sigma$), stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm Halo}$),
and the Sersic index. We find that machine learning regressors provide
predictive capabilities superior to linear regression in many scaling relations
in simulations, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor has the strongest
performance. SMBH-host relations have different strengths in different
simulations as a result of their sub-grid models. Similar to the observations,
the $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$ relation is a strong correlation in all simulations,
but in TNG, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$M_{\star}$ relation is even tighter than $M_{\rm

simulations. Low mass SMBHs tend to be poorly correlated with their host
galaxies, but including them can still help machines better grasp the

correlate with $M_{\rm BH} $ but poorly correlate with each other can improve
MLP's performance. $M_{\rm BH} $ is most accurately predicted when all galaxy

significant additional dynamical $splashing$ of these particular in-situ stars
despite a 1:5 stellar mass merger. The observed Splash may therefore reflect
the already turbulent early disc, subsequently intermixed with accreted stars
and those formed from merger-driven gas inflows, rather than a distinct
merger-heated population. When selecting stars with similar chemistry and age
as the Splash-like ones, we find their azimuthal velocity distribution to be
broad and positively skewed, with $V_\varphi =
73_{-59}^{+74}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The transition to a rotation-supported
disc with large azimuthal velocities occurs only during or after the merger.
Our results suggest an alternative to the proposed splashing scenario and
highlight the need to disentangle the relative contributions of merger-induced
heating and intrinsically hot disc formation to clarify the nature of
Splash-like stars and their role in shaping the early Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21529v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sco X-1 as a continuous gravitational waves source: modelling the
  secular evolution using MESA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gianluca Pagliaro, Maria Alessandra Papa, Jing Ming, Devina Misra</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs)
from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform- and progenitor- parameters.
We study the evolution of different Sco X-1 progenitors, identifying those that
give rise to detectable signals. We model the spin evolution of the neutron
star (NS) by the accretion torque and the GW torque. We consider two mechanisms
for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the GW torque: i) magnetic
mountains and ii) deformation after crustal breakage. Both torques are
intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the
NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA,
starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a
magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for
detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases
with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G
(Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs,
with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the
waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of
detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on
$\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust
does not break. When $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with
$M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70%
all crusts break. In some systems the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase.
If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW
signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies. We estimate
current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability
increases substantially -- to around 41% -- with third-generation detectors.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21221v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forecasts of constraining isotropic cosmic birefringence on AliCPT-1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiazheng Dou, Wen Zhao</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic birefringence (CB) is a promising probe of parity-violating physics
beyond the Standard Model, characterized by the rotation of the linear
polarization plane of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. This effect,
quantified by the birefringence angle $\beta$, generates non-zero $EB$ and $TB$
correlations that are otherwise absent in standard cosmology. However,
instrumental miscalibration angles $\alpha$ can mimic this signal,
necessitating a joint estimation approach. In this work, we forecast the
sensitivity of the AliCPT experiment, combined with Planck HFI data, on
constraining the isotropic CB angle using a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood
method. We simulate observations under various foreground complexities,
rotation angles, and scanning strategies, and demonstrate that AliCPT can
achieve an uncertainty of $\sigma(\beta)=0.09^\circ$ with one-year data, which
will improve to $0.026^\circ$ after four years' observations. We also find that
neglecting or mismodeling the foreground $EB$ correlation will introduce
significant biases, which can be alleviated under a clean but small sky patch.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20338v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparative Analysis of Thermal Models for Test Masses in

optimizing the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers like Virgo. In
fact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption
can induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed
investigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular,
future scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating
absorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a
comprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the
multilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where
the coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary
condition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating
design, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results
reveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the
coating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates
that temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed
model by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental
uncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests
that computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate
results for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses. Moreover,
the critical role of accurately characterizing the total power absorbed by the
coating is emphasized.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20086v1" target="_blank"><h2>MG-NECOLA: Fast Neural Emulators for Modified Gravity Cosmologies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

gravity on cosmological scales, but high-resolution N-body simulations of
modified gravity (MG) are prohibitively expensive. We present MG-NECOLA, a
convolutional neural network that enhances fast MG-PICOLA simulations to
near-N-body fidelity at a fraction of the cost. MG-NECOLA reproduces QUIJOTE-MG
N-body results in the power spectrum and bispectrum with better than 1%
accuracy down to non-linear scales ($k \simeq 1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), while
reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude. Importantly,
although trained only on $f(R)$ models with massless neutrinos, the network
generalizes robustly to scenarios with massive neutrinos, preserving accuracy
to within 5% at non-linear scales. This combination of precision and robustness
establishes MG-NECOLA as a practical emulator for producing large ensembles of
high-fidelity simulations, enabling efficient exploration of modified gravity

neutron star binary system is possible at a sufficiently large initial
asymmetry of the component masses. At the final stage of the evolution of such
systems, the low-mass neutron star fills its Roche lobe, whereupon its mass is
gradually transferred to the more massive component. At a certain point, the
stability of the mass transfer is lost, causing the minimum-mass neutron star
to explode. In the present stripping calculations, the effect of
non-conservative mass transfer has been taken into account for the first time,
resulting in an increase in the duration of stable mass transfer from a few
tenths of a second to a few seconds. This allows the time delay of 1.7 s
between the loss of the gravitational-wave signal and the detection of the
gamma-ray burst from the multimessenger event GW170817-GRB170817A to be
naturally explained. The interaction of the envelope of the exploded
minimum-mass neutron star with the matter ejected during non-conservative mass
transfer may explain two episodes in the light curve of this gamma-ray burst.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21331v1" target="_blank"><h2>A simple toy model for the electromagnetic variability of lump-dominated
  circumbinary disks around binary black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R. Mignon-Risse, P. Varniere, F. Casse</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A. 13 pages, 12 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The electromagnetic detection of circumbinary disks around pre-merger binary
black holes (BBHs) relies on theoretical predictions. These are generally
obtained through expensive numerical simulations, but simple or fast toy models
are lacking to unleash the potential of these theoretical advances for
observational purposes. We aim to present a simple toy model to compute the
electromagnetic variability of circumbinary disks around circular-orbit BBHs at
relativistic separations, focusing on the impact of disk non-axisymmetries. We
assume that the disk is threaded by spiral arms and hosts a hotspot linked to
an overdense structure (the {\lq}lump{\rq}) preferably reported in binaries
close to equal mass. We build a simple temperature distribution, and estimate
its thermal emission, perceived by a distant observer, via a ray-tracing code
in a BBH approximate metric. We propose a toy model reproducing the main
lightcurve features and show it is consistent with 2D general-hydrodynamical
simulations under the assumption of compressional heating and expansional
cooling except for purely dynamical effects such as the binary-lump beat. The
lightcurve exhibits a main modulation at the lump's period (i.e. a few times
the orbital period), due to relativistic Doppler effect, and a shorter one at
the orbital-like period, due to spiral arms or the beat. These are more
prominent in the optical/UV band for a total binary mass $M\, {=} \,
10^{4-10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, where the disk energy spectrum peaks. For
$M=10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, a $4\%$-amplitude lump modulation is detectable
with the Vera Rubin Observatory after six months of observation, up to $z\,
{=}\, 0.5$. We proposed a new, simple toy model that can be used, for instance,
to test the compatibility of the periodicity of BBH candidate sources with a
circumbinary disk origin.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20574v1" target="_blank"><h2>After 54 years of bar instability studies: a fresh surprise</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

Carlberg</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 8 figs, to appear in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The well-known bar instability of rotationally-supported disk galaxy models
has been studied extensively since its first discovery over half a century ago.
We were therefore very surprised to find cases of disks embedded in rigid
halos, which on the basis of widely-cited criteria should be unstable, that
appeared to be robustly stable. Here we show that the unstable bar mode in such
simulations was being suppressed by changes to the disk caused by other
instabilities having higher angular symmetry that were the first to saturate.
Although this may seem like a promising solution to the long-standing puzzle
presented by the apparent stability of real disk galaxies, we also show that
instability is restored in the same models when the rigid halo is replaced by a
live population of particles, where the usual stability conditions apply. Our
study has been confined to a narrow range of models, and we cannot therefore
exclude the possibility that mode interference may be able to prevent bar
formation in other models having live halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21632v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the statistical properties of double radio relics in the

sides of merging galaxy clusters, are a rare subclass of radio relics that are
believed to trace merger shocks and provide valuable constraints on plasma
acceleration models and merger history. With the number of known double relics
growing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their
properties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological
magnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with
TNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The
simulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly
consistent with the observations. We find that the two relics in a given double
system often differ significantly in their shock properties and magnetic field
strengths. This diversity implies that the observed brightness asymmetry in the
pair cannot be explained by a single factor alone, but instead reflects an
interplay of multiple physical parameters. Nevertheless, double radio relics
tend to align with the collision axis within $\sim30^{\circ}$ and their
separation ($d_{\rm drr}$) correlates tightly with the time since collision
(TSC) as ${\rm TSC~[Gyr]} = 0.52 d_{\rm drr}/R_{500\rm c} - 0.24$, allowing it
to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.2~\rm Gyr$. With the statistical
samples of simulated radio relics, we predict that low-mass clusters will
constitute the dominant population of double radio relic systems detected with
upcoming surveys such as SKA. These results demonstrate that double radio
relics can serve as robust probes of merger dynamics and plasma acceleration,
and that simulations provide critical guidance for interpreting the large
samples expected from next-generation radio surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21521v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synergy between CSST and third-generation gravitational-wave detectors:

galaxies and can thus serve, like galaxies, as tracers of the universe's
large-scale structure. In GW observations, waveform analysis provides direct
measurements of luminosity distances; however, the redshifts of GW sources
cannot be determined due to the mass-redshift degeneracy. By cross-correlating
GW events with galaxies, one can establish a correspondence between luminosity
distance and redshift shells, enabling cosmological inference. In this work, we
explore the scientific potential of cross-correlating GW sources detected by
third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors with the photometric redshift
survey of the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). We find that the
constraint precisions of the Hubble constant and the matter density parameter
can reach $1.04\%$ and $2.04\%$, respectively. The GW clustering bias
parameters $A_{\rm GW}$ and $\gamma$ can be constrained to $1.52\%$ and
$4.67\%$, respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of
the synergy between CSST and 3G ground-based GW detectors in constraining
cosmological models and probing GW source formation channels using
cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies.</p></br></body>
