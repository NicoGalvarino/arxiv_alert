  Learning and Test-Time Optimization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Abu Bucker Siddik, Diane Oyen, Soumi De, Greg Olmschenk, Constantinos Kalapotharakos</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted at ML4Astro 2025, ICML, Vancouver, CA</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Probing properties of neutron stars from photometric observations of these
objects helps us answer crucial questions at the forefront of multi-messenger
astronomy, such as, what is behavior of highest density matter in extreme
environments and what is the procedure of generation and evolution of magnetic
fields in these astrophysical environments? However, uncertainties and
degeneracies-where different parameter sets produce similar light curves-make
this task challenging. We propose a deep learning framework for inferring
pulsar parameters from observed light curves. Traditional deep learning models
are not designed to produce multiple degenerate solutions for a given input. To
address this, we introduce a custom loss function that incorporates a light
curve emulator as a forward model, along with a dissimilarity loss that
encourages the model to capture diverse, degenerate parameter sets for a given
light curve. We further introduce a test-time optimization scheme that refines
predicted parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between the observed light
curve and those reconstructed by the forward model from predicted parameters
during inference. The model is trained using a suite of state-of-the-art
simulated pulsar light curves. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter sets
predicted by our approach reproduce light curves that are consistent with the
true observation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18920v1" target="_blank"><h2>Very High Precision Astrometry for Exoplanets and Dark Matter with the

by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars
with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like
exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter
in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter
large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable
Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect
rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider
here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated
astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited
images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20
milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform
high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass
planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically
improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy
dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter
particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The
visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with
stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector
Calibration Unit'' system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel
positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable
telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to
sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter
through stellar motion.</p></br></body>
