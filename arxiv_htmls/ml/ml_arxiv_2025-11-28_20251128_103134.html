Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21663v1" target="_blank"><h2>Attention-Guided Patch-Wise Sparse Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Naifu Zhang, Wei Tao, Xi Xiao, Qianpu Sun, Yuxin Zheng, Wentao Mo, Peiqiang Wang, Nan Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21635v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mechanisms of Non-Monotonic Scaling in Vision Transformers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages total (11 pages main text, 1 pages references, 4 pages appendix), 5 figures, 11 tables.

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21626v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scale-Agnostic Kolmogorov-Arnold Geometry in Neural Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mathew Vanherreweghe, Michael H.

However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.
  We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21622v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the Origin of Algorithmic Progress in AI</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hans Gundlach, Alex Fogelson, Jayson Lynch, Ana Trisovic, Jonathan Rosenfeld, Anmol Sandhu, Neil Thompson<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21607v1" target="_blank"><h2>Beyond Accuracy: An Empirical Study of Uncertainty Estimation in Imputation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zarin Tahia Hossain, Mostafa Milani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.DB, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> To appear in conference proceedings<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Handling missing data is a central challenge in data-driven analysis. Modern imputation methods not only aim for accurate reconstruction but also differ in how they represent and quantify uncertainty. Yet, the reliability and calibration of these uncertainty estimates remain poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of uncertainty in imputation, comparing representative methods from three major families: statistical (MICE, SoftImpute), distribution alignment (OT-Impute), and deep generative (GAIN, MIWAE, TabCSDI). Experiments span multiple datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates. Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty. We analyze method-specific trade-offs among accuracy, calibration, and runtime, identify stable configurations, and offer guidelines for selecting uncertainty-aware imputers in data cleaning and downstream machine learning pipelines.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21594v1" target="_blank"><h2>Visualizing LLM Latent Space Geometry Through Dimensionality Reduction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alex Ning, Vainateya Rangaraju<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 16 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dimensionality reduction (title, abstract), latent space (title, abstract), transformer (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret.

This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21581v1" target="_blank"><h2>Learning When to Stop: Adaptive Latent Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alex Ning, Yen-Ling Kuo, Gabe Gomes<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts.

A key defense against the misuse of AI-generated audio is by watermarking it, so that it can be easily distinguished from genuine audio. As those seeking to misuse AI-generated audio may thus seek to remove audio watermarks, studying effective watermark removal techniques is critical to being able to objectively evaluate the robustness of audio watermarks against removal. Previous watermark removal schemes either assume impractical knowledge of the watermarks they are designed to remove or are computationally expensive, potentially generating a false sense of confidence in current watermark schemes.
  We introduce HarmonicAttack, an efficient audio watermark removal method that only requires the basic ability to generate the watermarks from the targeted scheme and nothing else. With this, we are able to train a general watermark removal model that is able to remove the watermarks generated by the targeted scheme from any watermarked audio sample. HarmonicAttack employs a dual-path convolutional autoencoder that operates in both temporal and frequency domains, along with GAN-style training, to separate the watermark from the original audio. When evaluated against state-of-the-art watermark schemes AudioSeal, WavMark, and Silentcipher, HarmonicAttack demonstrates greater watermark removal ability than previous watermark removal methods with near real-time performance. Moreover, while HarmonicAttack requires training, we find that it is able to transfer to out-of-distribution samples with minimal degradation in performance.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21574v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation for 3D Point Cloud Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiang Gu, Liming Lu, Xu Zheng, Anan Du, Yongbin Zhou, Shuchao Pang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21567v1" target="_blank"><h2>Enhanced antineutrino emission from $β$ decay in core-collapse supernovae with self-consistent weak decay rates <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> T.

In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $β$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $β$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $β$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21561v1" target="_blank"><h2>Machine Learning Approaches to Clinical Risk Prediction: Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment in Electronic Health Records</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Wei-Chen Chang, Lu Dai, Ting Xu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 3 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21550v1" target="_blank"><h2>MMA: A Momentum Mamba Architecture for Human Activity Recognition with Inertial Sensors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Thai-Khanh Nguyen, Uyen Vo, Tan M.

Conventional deep models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers have advanced HAR but remain limited by vanishing or exloding gradients, high computational cost, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Structured state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba address these challenges with linear complexity and effective temporal modeling, yet they are restricted to first-order dynamics without stable longterm memory mechanisms. We introduce Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented SSM that incorporates second-order dynamics to improve stability of information flow across time steps, robustness, and long-sequence modeling. Two extensions further expand its capacity: Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling. Experiments on multiple HAR benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over vanilla Mamba and Transformer baselines in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed. With only moderate increases in training cost, momentum-augmented SSMs offer a favorable accuracy-efficiency balance, establishing them as a scalable paradigm for HAR and a promising principal framework for broader sequence modeling applications.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21514v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mechanistic Interpretability for Transformer-based Time Series Classification</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Matīss Kalnāre, Sofoklis Kitharidis, Thomas Bäck, Niki van Stein<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> explainability (abstract), transformer (title, abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging.

At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices.

However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21477v1" target="_blank"><h2>Frequency-Aware Token Reduction for Efficient Vision Transformer</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dong-Jae Lee, Jiwan Hur, Jaehyun Choi, Jaemyung Yu, Junmo Kim<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Neurips 2025<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (title, abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge.

However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21474v1" target="_blank"><h2>Going with the Speed of Sound: Pushing Neural Surrogates into Highly-turbulent Transonic Regimes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fabian Paischer, Leo Cotteleer, Yann Dreze, Richard Kurle, Dylan Rubini, Maurits Bleeker, Tobias Kronlachner, Johannes Brandstetter<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CE, cs.AI, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> NeurIPS 2025 ML4PS Workshop<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract), VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The widespread use of neural surrogates in automotive aerodynamics, enabled by datasets such as DrivAerML and DrivAerNet++, has primarily focused on bluff-body flows with large wakes. Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21466v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mean-Field Limits for Two-Layer Neural Networks Trained with Consensus-Based Optimization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> William De Deyn, Michael Herty, Giovanni Samaey<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, math.OC<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO).

The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network.

Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features.

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes.

Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration.

However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21408v1" target="_blank"><h2>Subjective Depth and Timescale Transformers: Learning Where and When to Compute</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Frederico Wieser, Martin Benfeghoul, Haitham Bou Ammar, Jun Wang, Zafeirios Fountas<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.IT<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (title, abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21398v1" target="_blank"><h2>Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jiayuan Zhang, Kaiquan Chen, Zhihao Lu, Enshen Zhou, Qian Yu, Jing Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.HC, cs.MA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Paper accepted to AAAI 2026<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21397v1" target="_blank"><h2>Do Reasoning Vision-Language Models Inversely Scale in Test-Time Compute?

To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21395v1" target="_blank"><h2>Monet: Reasoning in Latent Visual Space Beyond Images and Language</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Qixun Wang, Yang Shi, Yifei Wang, Yuanxing Zhang, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai, Xianghua Ying, Yisen Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC.

The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21364v1" target="_blank"><h2>BanglaMM-Disaster: A Multimodal Transformer-Based Deep Learning Framework for Multiclass Disaster Classification in Bangla</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ariful Islam, Md Rifat Hossen, Md.

In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21342v1" target="_blank"><h2>Generating Separated Singing Vocals Using a Diffusion Model Conditioned on Music Mixtures</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Genís Plaja-Roglans, Yun-Ning Hung, Xavier Serra, Igor Pereira<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.SD, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication at WASPAA 2025<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Separating the individual elements in a musical mixture is an essential process for music analysis and practice. While this is generally addressed using neural networks optimized to mask or transform the time-frequency representation of a mixture to extract the target sources, the flexibility and generalization capabilities of generative diffusion models are giving rise to a novel class of solutions for this complicated task. In this work, we explore singing voice separation from real music recordings using a diffusion model which is trained to generate the solo vocals conditioned on the corresponding mixture. Our approach improves upon prior generative systems and achieves competitive objective scores against non-generative baselines when trained with supplementary data. The iterative nature of diffusion sampling enables the user to control the quality-efficiency trade-off, and also refine the output when needed. We present an ablation study of the sampling algorithm, highlighting the effects of the user-configurable parameters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21340v1" target="_blank"><h2>Phase-Aware Code-Aided EM Algorithm for Blind Channel Estimation in PSK-Modulated OFDM</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chin-Hung Chen, Ivana Nikoloska, Wim van Houtum, Yan Wu, Alex Alvarado<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> eess.SP, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> preprint<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21339v1" target="_blank"><h2>SurgMLLMBench: A Multimodal Large Language Model Benchmark Dataset for Surgical Scene Understanding</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tae-Min Choi, Tae Kyeong Jeong, Garam Kim, Jaemin Lee, Yeongyoon Koh, In Cheul Choi, Jae-Ho Chung, Jong Woong Park, Juyoun Park<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications.

We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset.

In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21337v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hybrid SIFT-SNN for Efficient Anomaly Detection of Traffic Flow-Control Infrastructure</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Munish Rathee, Boris Bačić, Maryam Doborjeh<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 6 figures.

The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21331v1" target="_blank"><h2>The More, the Merrier: Contrastive Fusion for Higher-Order Multimodal Alignment</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Stefanos Koutoupis, Michaela Areti Zervou, Konstantinos Kontras, Maarten De Vos, Panagiotis Tsakalides, Grigorios Tsagatakis<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21325v1" target="_blank"><h2>SONAR: Spectral-Contrastive Audio Residuals for Generalizable Deepfake Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ido Nitzan HIdekel, Gal lifshitz, Khen Cohen, Dan Raviv<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.SD, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract), latent space (abstract), neural network (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Deepfake (DF) audio detectors still struggle to generalize to out of distribution inputs. A central reason is spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency structure before high-frequency (HF) details, which both causes DF generators to leave HF artifacts and leaves those same artifacts under-exploited by common detectors. To address this gap, we propose Spectral-cONtrastive Audio Residuals (SONAR), a frequency-guided framework that explicitly disentangles an audio signal into complementary representations. An XLSR encoder captures the dominant low-frequency content, while the same cloned path, preceded by learnable SRM, value-constrained high-pass filters, distills faint HF residuals. Frequency cross-attention reunites the two views for long- and short-range frequency dependencies, and a frequency-aware Jensen-Shannon contrastive loss pulls real content-noise pairs together while pushing fake embeddings apart, accelerating optimization and sharpening decision boundaries. Evaluated on the ASVspoof 2021 and in-the-wild benchmarks, SONAR attains state-of-the-art performance and converges four times faster than strong baselines. By elevating faint high-frequency residuals to first-class learning signals, SONAR unveils a fully data-driven, frequency-guided contrastive framework that splits the latent space into two disjoint manifolds: natural-HF for genuine audio and distorted-HF for synthetic audio, thereby sharpening decision boundaries. Because the scheme operates purely at the representation level, it is architecture-agnostic and, in future work, can be seamlessly integrated into any model or modality where subtle high-frequency cues are decisive.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21276v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Physics-Informed U-net-LSTM Network for Data-Driven Seismic Response Modeling of Structures</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sutirtha Biswas, Kshitij Kumar Yadav<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (title), convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures.

Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21260v1" target="_blank"><h2>Causality Without Causal Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Joseph Y.

Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models.

Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}=10^{42.31\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21232v1" target="_blank"><h2>RISC-V Based TinyML Accelerator for Depthwise Separable Convolutions in Edge AI</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Muhammed Yildirim, Ozcan Ozturk<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AR, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 7 tables, 14 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The increasing demand for on-device intelligence in Edge AI and TinyML applications requires the efficient execution of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 employ Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC) to reduce computational complexity, their multi-stage design introduces a critical performance bottleneck inherent to layer-by-layer execution: the high energy and latency cost of transferring intermediate feature maps to either large on-chip buffers or off-chip DRAM. To address this memory wall, this paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator architecture that utilizes a fused pixel-wise dataflow. Implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor, our architecture eliminates the need for intermediate buffers entirely, reducing the data movement up to 87\% compared to conventional layer-by-layer execution. It computes a single output pixel to completion across all DSC stages-expansion, depthwise convolution, and projection-by streaming data through a tightly-coupled pipeline without writing to memory. Evaluated on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, our design achieves a speedup of up to 59.3x over the baseline software execution on the RISC-V core. Furthermore, ASIC synthesis projects a compact 0.284 mm$^2$ footprint with 910 mW power at 2 GHz in 28 nm, and a 1.20 mm$^2$ footprint with 233 mW power at 300 MHz in 40 nm. This work confirms the feasibility of a zero-buffer dataflow within a TinyML resource envelope, offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming the memory wall in edge AI accelerators.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21213v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio: a phonon-glass electron-crystal descriptor for data-driven thermoelectric design</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yifan Sun, Zhi Li, Tetsuya Imamura, Yuji Ohishi, Chris Wolverton, Ken Kurosaki<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Thermoelectrics (TEs) are promising candidates for energy harvesting with performance quantified by figure of merit, $ZT$. To accelerate the discovery of high-$ZT$ materials, efforts have focused on identifying compounds with low thermal conductivity $κ$. Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$κ$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $κ$ and $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$κ$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21208v1" target="_blank"><h2>I-GLIDE: Input Groups for Latent Health Indicators in Degradation Estimation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lucas Thil, Jesse Read, Rim Kaddah, Guillaume Doquet<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Included in the conference series: Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (abstract), latent space (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability.

This study focuses on galaxies observed up to redshift approximately at 8, capturing them at early evolutionary stages where their faintness and structural complexity pose challenges for the traditional classification methods. By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3.

In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21192v1" target="_blank"><h2>When Robots Obey the Patch: Universal Transferable Patch Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hui Lu, Yi Yu, Yiming Yang, Chenyu Yi, Qixin Zhang, Bingquan Shen, Alex C.

We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels.

Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21150v1" target="_blank"><h2>LLaVA-UHD v3: Progressive Visual Compression for Efficient Native-Resolution Encoding in MLLMs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shichu Sun, Yichen Zhang, Haolin Song, Zonghao Guo, Chi Chen, Yidan Zhang, Yuan Yao, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multi-modal (abstract), transformer (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21121v1" target="_blank"><h2>Beyond Patch Aggregation: 3-Pass Pyramid Indexing for Vision-Enhanced Document Retrieval</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anup Roy, Rishabh Gyanendra Upadhyay, Animesh Rameshbhai Panara, Robin Mills<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.IR, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.
  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.
  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21120v1" target="_blank"><h2>Learning Cell-Aware Hierarchical Multi-Modal Representations for Robust Molecular Modeling</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mengran Li, Zelin Zang, Wenbin Xing, Junzhou Chen, Ronghui Zhang, Jiebo Luo, Stan Z.

While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation. We study the convergence of a proximal subgradient method for both formulations, highlighting their structural differences lead to distinct computational subproblems along the iterations. In particular, the relaxed formulation admits significantly cheaper proximal updates, reflecting an inherent trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational tractability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21109v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interpretable Fair Clustering</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mudi Jiang, Jiahui Zhou, Xinying Liu, Zengyou He, Zhikui Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21107v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamic Stratified Contrastive Learning with Upstream Augmentation for MILP Branching</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tongkai Lu, Shuai Ma, Chongyang Tao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21101v1" target="_blank"><h2>MortgageLLM: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining with Residual Instruction Transfer, Alignment Tuning, and Task-Specific Routing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Manish Jain, Satheesh Kumar Ponnambalam, Salman Faroz, Chandrakanth Lns, Vinay Sharma<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CL, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> domain adaptation (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21095v1" target="_blank"><h2>Generative Early Stage Ranking</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Juhee Hong, Meng Liu, Shengzhi Wang, Xiaoheng Mao, Huihui Cheng, Leon Gao, Christopher Leung, Jin Zhou, Chandra Mouli Sekar, Zhao Zhu, Ruochen Liu, Tuan Trieu, Dawei Sun, Jeet Kanjani, Rui Li, Jing Qian, Xuan Cao, Minjie Fan, Mingze Gao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21089v1" target="_blank"><h2>MLPMoE: Zero-Shot Architectural Metamorphosis of Dense LLM MLPs into Static Mixture-of-Experts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ivan Novikov<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability.

Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21063v1" target="_blank"><h2>G-Net: A Provably Easy Construction of High-Accuracy Random Binary Neural Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alireza Aghasi, Nicholas Marshall, Saeid Pourmand, Wyatt Whiting<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy.

We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21032v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Probabilistic Framework for Temporal Distribution Generalization in Industry-Scale Recommender Systems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuxuan Zhu, Cong Fu, Yabo Ni, Anxiang Zeng, Yuan Fang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data augmentation (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Traditional spectral line analysis relies heavily on manual intervention, which becomes impractical when handling the massive datasets produced by modern facilities like ALMA. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to automate spectral line fitting. Using observational data from ALMA, we train a neural network that maps both molecular spectroscopic data and observed spectra to physical parameters such as excitation temperature and column density. The neural network predictions can serve as initial estimates and be further refined using a local optimizer. Our method achieves consistent fitting results compared to global optimization with multiple runs, while reducing the number of forward modeling runs by an order of magnitude. We apply our method to pixel-level fitting for an observation of the G327.3-0.6 hot core and validate our results using XCLASS. We perform the fitting for CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$CN, and C$_2$H$_3$CN.

We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21012v1" target="_blank"><h2>Refined classification of YSOs and AGB stars by IR magnitudes, colors, and time-domain analysis with machine learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hyunwook Jheonn, Jeong-Eun Lee, Jinho Lee, Seonjae Lee, Hyeyoon Lee, ShinGeon Kim, Carlos Contreras Peña, Mi-Ryang Kim<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 11 figures, accepted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce a binary classification model, {\it the Double Filter Model}, utilizing various machine learning and deep learning methods to classify Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. Since YSOs and AGB stars share similar infrared (IR) photometric characteristics due to comparable temperatures and the presence of circumstellar dust, distinguishing them is challenging and often leads to misclassification. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have helped reduce YSO-AGB misclassifications, achieving a reliable separation remains challenging. Given that YSOs and AGB stars exhibit distinct light curves resulting from different variability mechanisms, our Double Filter Model leverages light curve data to enhance classification accuracy. This approach uncovered YSOs and AGB stars that were misclassified in IR photometry and was validated against Taurus YSOs and spectroscopically confirmed AGB stars.

To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition.

In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits.

However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods.

Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20977v1" target="_blank"><h2>Independent policy gradient-based reinforcement learning for economic and reliable energy management of multi-microgrid systems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Junkai Hu, Li Xia<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> eess.SY, cs.LG, math.OC<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Efficiency and reliability are both crucial for energy management, especially in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs) integrating intermittent and distributed renewable energy sources. This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20973v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards Audio Token Compression in Large Audio Language Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Saurabhchand Bhati, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.
  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20960v1" target="_blank"><h2>Geometric Calibration and Neutral Zones for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Class Classification</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Soumojit Das, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Prashanta Dutta<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.ME<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain. We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.
  Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\% of errors while deferring 34.5\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees relevant to applications requiring rigorous validation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20936v1" target="_blank"><h2>Wavelet-Guided Water-Level Estimation for ISAC</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ayoob Salari, Kai Wu, Khawaja Fahad Masood, Y.

Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20934v1" target="_blank"><h2>Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Biagio La Rosa, Leilani H.

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20931v1" target="_blank"><h2>Open Vocabulary Compositional Explanations for Neuron Alignment</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Biagio La Rosa, Leilani H.

Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20902v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Taxonomy of Pix Fraud in Brazil: Attack Methodologies, AI-Driven Amplification, and Defensive Strategies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Glener Lanes Pizzolato, Brenda Medeiros Lopes, Claudio Schepke, Diego Kreutz<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.CY<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, submitted to ERRC/WRSeg 2025<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> literature review (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This work presents a review of attack methodologies targeting Pix, the instant payment system launched by the Central Bank of Brazil in 2020.

We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20837v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constrained deep learning for pricing and hedging european options in incomplete markets</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nicolas Baradel<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> q-fin.CP, stat.ML<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In incomplete financial markets, pricing and hedging European options lack a unique no-arbitrage solution due to unhedgeable risks. This paper introduces a constrained deep learning approach to determine option prices and hedging strategies that minimize the Profit and Loss (P&L) distribution around zero. We employ a single neural network to represent the option price function, with its gradient serving as the hedging strategy, optimized via a loss function enforcing the self-financing portfolio condition. A key challenge arises from the non-smooth nature of option payoffs (e.g., vanilla calls are non-differentiable at-the-money, while digital options are discontinuous), which conflicts with the inherent smoothness of standard neural networks. To address this, we compare unconstrained networks against constrained architectures that explicitly embed the terminal payoff condition, drawing inspiration from PDE-solving techniques. Our framework assumes two tradable assets: the underlying and a liquid call option capturing volatility dynamics. Numerical experiments evaluate the method on simple options with varying non-smoothness, the exotic Equinox option, and scenarios with market jumps for robustness. Results demonstrate superior P&L distributions, highlighting the efficacy of constrained networks in handling realistic payoffs. This work advances machine learning applications in quantitative finance by integrating boundary constraints, offering a practical tool for pricing and hedging in incomplete markets.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20830v1" target="_blank"><h2>Autoregressive Surrogate Modeling of the Solar Wind with Spherical Fourier Neural Operator</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Reza Mansouri, Dustin Kempton, Pete Riley, Rafal Angryk<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> IEEE Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach.

The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias.

Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20814v1" target="_blank"><h2>SPHINX: A Synthetic Environment for Visual Perception and Reasoning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Md Tanvirul Alam, Saksham Aggarwal, Justin Yang Chae, Nidhi Rastogi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives.

To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction.

However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (> 105M$_{\odot}$) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10$μ$m, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10$μ$m emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (> 106M$_{\odot}$) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20766v1" target="_blank"><h2>OpenApps: Simulating Environment Variations to Measure UI-Agent Reliability</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Karen Ullrich, Jingtong Su, Claudia Shi, Arjun Subramonian, Amir Bar, Ivan Evtimov, Nikolaos Tsilivis, Randall Balestriero, Julia Kempe, Mark Ibrahim<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations.

Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($Λ$CDM+$M_ν$), spatial curvature ($oΛ$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\approx30\%$ and $\approx20\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\,{\rm eV}$, with the $30\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\,{\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\,{\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\,{\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20755v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Observations to Simulations: A Neural-Network Approach to Intracluster Medium Kinematics <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> E.

We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity.

We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20746v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neural Deprojection of Galaxy Stellar Mass Profiles <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20639v1" target="_blank"><h2>Latent Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jiaru Zou, Xiyuan Yang, Ruizhong Qiu, Gaotang Li, Katherine Tieu, Pan Lu, Ke Shen, Hanghang Tong, Yejin Choi, Jingrui He, James Zou, Mengdi Wang, Ling Yang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Project:this https URL<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> latent space (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference.

This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20627v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fighting AI with AI: Leveraging Foundation Models for Assuring AI-Enabled Safety-Critical Systems <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anastasia Mavridou, Divya Gopinath, Corina S.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training.

Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing a unique approach for understanding and predict motion dynamics during manual material handling activities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20612v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sparse-to-Field Reconstruction via Stochastic Neural Dynamic Mode Decomposition <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yujin Kim, Sarah Dean<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, eess.SY<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Many consequential real-world systems, like wind fields and ocean currents, are dynamic and hard to model. Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\leq 5\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\leq z \leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20594v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variational bagging: a robust approach for Bayesian uncertainty quantification <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shitao Fan, Ilsang Ohn, David Dunson, Lizhen Lin<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> math.ST, stat.ML<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 44 pages, 14 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> variational autoencoder (abstract), VAE (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Variational Bayes methods are popular due to their computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse applications. In specifying the variational family, mean-field classes are commonly used, which enables efficient algorithms such as coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) but fails to capture parameter dependence and typically underestimates uncertainty. In this work, we introduce a variational bagging approach that integrates a bagging procedure with variational Bayes, resulting in a bagged variational posterior for improved inference. We establish strong theoretical guarantees, including posterior contraction rates for general models and a Bernstein-von Mises (BVM) type theorem that ensures valid uncertainty quantification. Notably, our results show that even when using a mean-field variational family, our approach can recover off-diagonal elements of the limiting covariance structure and provide proper uncertainty quantification. In addition, variational bagging is robust to model misspecification, with covariance structures matching those of the target covariance. We illustrate our variational bagging method in numerical studies through applications to parametric models, finite mixture models, deep neural networks, and variational autoencoders (VAEs).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20592v1" target="_blank"><h2>Latent Diffusion Inversion Requires Understanding the Latent Space <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mingxing Rao, Bowen Qu, Daniel Moyer<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.CV<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> latent space (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The recovery of training data from generative models (``model inversion'') has been extensively studied for diffusion models in the data domain. The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\%FPR (6.42\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr.

To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20586v2" target="_blank"><h2>PaTAS: A Parallel System for Trust Propagation in Neural Networks Using Subjective Logic <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Koffi Ismael Ouattara, Ioannis Krontiris, Theo Dimitrakos, Dennis Eisermann, Frank Kargl<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.AI, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Trustworthiness has become a key requirement for the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in safety-critical applications. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS), a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through Trust Nodes and Trust Functions that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a Parameter Trust Update mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA) method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20577v1" target="_blank"><h2>MSTN: Fast and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Model <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sumit S Shevtekar, Chandresh K Maurya, Gourab Sil<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), transformer (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST.

However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20551v1" target="_blank"><h2>Time-Domain Linear Model-based Framework for Passive Acoustic Mapping of Cavitation Activity <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera, Barbara Nicolas, Denis Kouamé, Bruno Gilles, Adrian Basarab<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> eess.SP, cs.AI, eess.IV<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Passive acoustic mapping enables the spatial mapping and temporal monitoring of cavitation activity, playing a crucial role in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20544v1" target="_blank"><h2>New York Smells: A Large Multimodal Dataset for Olfaction <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ege Ozguroglu, Junbang Liang, Ruoshi Liu, Mia Chiquier, Michael DeTienne, Wesley Wei Qian, Alexandra Horowitz, Andrew Owens, Carl Vondrick<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Project website atthis https URL<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> While olfaction is central to how animals perceive the world, this rich chemical sensory modality remains largely inaccessible to machines.

These processes may compress nearby regions, triggering further star formation, but the significance of triggered star formation across the Galactic disc is not well understood. This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L_radio/L_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20541v1" target="_blank"><h2>Automated Monitoring of Cultural Heritage Artifacts Using Semantic Segmentation <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrea Ranieri, Giorgio Palmieri, Silvia Biasotti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Keywords: Cultural Heritage, Monitoring, Deep Learning, U-Nets, Semantic Segmentation<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper addresses the critical need for automated crack detection in the preservation of cultural heritage through semantic segmentation.

Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging.

Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20490v1" target="_blank"><h2>MTBBench: A Multimodal Sequential Clinical Decision-Making Benchmark in Oncology <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kiril Vasilev, Alexandre Misrahi, Eeshaan Jain, Phil F Cheng, Petros Liakopoulos, Olivier Michielin, Michael Moor, Charlotte Bunne<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to NeurIPS 2025<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> multimodal (title, abstract), multi-modal (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for biomedical reasoning, but current benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical workflows. Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively. Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20480v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ranking-Enhanced Anomaly Detection Using Active Learning-Assisted Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoders <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sidahmed Benabderrahmane, James Cheney, Talal Rahwan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.NE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> anomaly detection (title, abstract), attention (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20474v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modular Deep Learning Framework for Assistive Perception: Gaze, Affect, and Speaker Identification <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Akshit Pramod Anchan, Jewelith Thomas, Sritama Roy<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 9 figures, and 3 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract), multimodal (abstract), attention (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Developing comprehensive assistive technologies requires the seamless integration of visual and auditory perception.

Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \textit{combinational}, \textit{exploratory}, and \textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20470v1" target="_blank"><h2>Efficient and Fast Generative-Based Singing Voice Separation using a Latent Diffusion Model <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Genís Plaja-Roglans, Yun-Ning Hung, Xavier Serra, Igor Pereira<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.SD, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for oral presentation at IJCNN 2025<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> latent space (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extracting individual elements from music mixtures is a valuable tool for music production and practice. While neural networks optimized to mask or transform mixture spectrograms into the individual source(s) have been the leading approach, the source overlap and correlation in music signals poses an inherent challenge. Also, accessing all sources in the mixture is crucial to train these systems, while complicated. Attempts to address these challenges in a generative fashion exist, however, the separation performance and inference efficiency remain limited. In this work, we study the potential of diffusion models to advance toward bridging this gap, focusing on generative singing voice separation relying only on corresponding pairs of isolated vocals and mixtures for training. To align with creative workflows, we leverage latent diffusion: the system generates samples encoded in a compact latent space, and subsequently decodes these into audio. This enables efficient optimization and faster inference. Our system is trained using only open data. We outperform existing generative separation systems, and level the compared non-generative systems on a list of signal quality measures and on interference removal. We provide a noise robustness study on the latent encoder, providing insights on its potential for the task. We release a modular toolkit for further research on the topic.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20462v2" target="_blank"><h2>STARFlow-V: End-to-End Video Generative Modeling with Normalizing Flows <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jiatao Gu, Ying Shen, Tianrong Chen, Laurent Dinh, Yuyang Wang, Miguel Angel Bautista, David Berthelot, Josh Susskind, Shuangfei Zhai<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.CV, cs.LG<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 9 figures.

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.
