  Viscosity in Galaxy Clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tirso Marin-Gilabert, Ulrich P. Steinwandel, Milena Valentini, John A. ZuHone, Klaus Dolag</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, physics.plasm-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 17 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the implementation of an anisotropic viscosity solver within the
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) framework of the TreeSPH code OpenGadget3. The
solver models anisotropic viscous transport along magnetic field lines
following the Braginskii formulation and includes physically motivated limiters
based on the mirror and firehose instability thresholds, which constrain the
viscous stress in weakly collisional plasmas. To validate the implementation,
we performed a suite of standard test problems -- including two variants of the
sound-wave test, circularly and linearly polarized Alfven waves, fast
magnetosonic wave, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability -- both with and
without the plasma-instability limiters. The results show excellent agreement
with the AREPO implementation of a similar anisotropic viscosity model (Berlok
et al. 2019), confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method. Our
formulation integrates seamlessly within the individual adaptive timestepping
framework of OpenGadget3, avoiding the need for subcycling. This provides
efficient and stable time integration while maintaining physical consistency.
Finally, we applied the new solver to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a
galaxy cluster, demonstrating its capability to model anisotropic transport and
plasma microphysics in realistic large-scale environments. Our implementation
offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying anisotropic
viscosity in magnetized astrophysical systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25911v1" target="_blank"><h2>TRIShUL: Technique for Reconstructing magnetic Interstellar Structure
  Using starLight polarization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Namita Uppal, Konstantinos Tassis, Vasiliki Pavlidou, Vincent Pelgrims, Myrto Falalaki</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, submitted to A&A; under review</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel technique to decompose line-of-sight (LOS) stellar
polarization as a function of distance, aimed at reconstructing three
dimensional (3D) plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic structures in the interstellar
medium (ISM). The method assumes that the observed polarization arises from
discrete, thin dust layers located at varying distances along the LOS. Using a
simple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the
distance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u)
to detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical
properties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps. We
benchmark the method using mock datasets representative of
high-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax
uncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey.
Tests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and
polarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective
background-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The
dependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization
amplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing
polarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high
Galactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic
solutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating
its accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both
methods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is
prior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number
of clouds along the LOS. These advantages make it flexible and broadly
applicable for multi-layer dust cloud reconstruction for the upcoming era of
large-scale stellar polarization surveys.</p></br></body>
