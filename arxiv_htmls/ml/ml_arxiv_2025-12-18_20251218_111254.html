The complexity and sheer size of these datasets pose significant challenges in their efficient analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In specific astronomical use cases, a number of dimensionality reduction techniques, including traditional linear (e.g. principal component analysis) and modern nonlinear methods (e.g. convolutional autoencoders) have been used to tackle this high-dimensional problem. In this study, we assess the strengths, weaknesses, and nuances of various methods in their ability to capture and preserve astronomically-relevant features at lower dimensions. We provide recommendations to guide users in identifying and incorporating these treatments to their data, and provide insights into the computational scalability of these methods for observatory level data processing. This benchmark study uses publicly available archival ALMA data from a diverse sampling of source morphologies and observing setups to assess the performance and trade-offs between computational cost, image reconstruction accuracy, and scalability. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of these techniques in regard to data segmentation and labeling algorithms and how they can be exploited for advanced data product generation and streamlined archival analysis as we prepare to enter the era of the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15555v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectroscopic Alerts for the Time-Domain Era</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alejandra Melo, Paula Sanchez-Saez, Valentin D.

While some of these facilities will generate enormous photometric alert streams, the physical interpretation of variability and transients often requires spectroscopy, which encodes changes in ionisation state, kinematics, and accretion that are inaccessible to photometry alone. A critical gap is therefore emerging: next-generation surveys may produce up to $\sim10^9$ alerts per year, whereas global spectroscopic follow-up is limited to only $\sim10^4$--$10^5$ transient spectra annually. We present the concept of spectroscopic alerts: real-time notifications triggered by significant spectral evolution, enabling spectroscopy to act as a discovery channel rather than solely as follow-up. We outline the key science cases enabled by this capability and describe the instrumental and operational requirements of a wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility capable of delivering real-time spectral discovery for 2040s time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15266v1" target="_blank"><h2>BBNet: accurate neural network emulator for primordial light element abundances</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fan Zhang, Hang Diao, Bohua Li, Joel Meyers, Paul R.

However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15142v1" target="_blank"><h2>Robustness Analysis of USmorph: I. Generalization Efficiency of Unsupervised Strategies and Supervised Learning in Galaxy Morphological Classification</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shiwei Zhu, Guanwen Fang, Yao Dai, Chichun Zhou, Yirui Zheng, Jie Song, Shiying Lu, Xu Kong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 < z < 1.2$, $I_{\mathrm{mag}} < 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15137v1" target="_blank"><h2>An updated efficient galaxy morphology classification model based on ConvNeXt encoding with UMAP dimensionality reduction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guanwen Fang, Shiwei Zhu, Jun Xu, Shiying Lu, Chichun Zhou, Yao Dai, Zesen Lin, Xu Kong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), dimensionality reduction (title, abstract), neural network (abstract), transfer learning (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an enhanced unsupervised machine learning (UML) module within our previous \texttt{USmorph} classification framework featuring two components: (1) hierarchical feature extraction via a pre-trained ConvNeXt convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning, and (2) nonlinear manifold learning using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for topology-aware dimensionality reduction. This dual-stage design enables efficient knowledge transfer from large-scale visual datasets while preserving morphological pattern geometry through UMAP's neighborhood preservation. We apply the upgraded UML on I-band images of 99,806 COSMOS galaxies at redshift $0.2<z<1.2$ (to ensure rest-frame optical morphology) with $I_{\mathrm{mag}}<25$. The predefined cluster number is optimized to 20 (reduced from 50 in the original framework), achieving significant computational savings. The 20 algorithmically identified clusters are merged into five physical morphology types. About 51\% of galaxies (50,056) were successfully classified. To assess classification effectiveness, we tested morphological parameters for massive galaxies with $M_{*}>10^{9}~M_{\odot}$. Our classification results align well with galaxy evolution theory. This improved algorithm significantly enhances galaxy morphology classification efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale sky surveys such as those planned with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15129v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dual-coding contrastive learning based on ConvNeXt and ViT models for morphological classification of galaxies in COSMOS-Web</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shiwei Zhu, Guanwen Fang, Chichun Zhou, Jie Song, Zesen Lin, Yao Dai, Xu Kong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In our previous works, we proposed a machine learning framework named \texttt{USmorph} for efficiently classifying galaxy morphology. In this study, we propose a self-supervised method called contrastive learning to upgrade the unsupervised machine learning (UML) part of the \texttt{USmorph} framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of feature extraction in this step. The upgraded UML method primarily consists of the following three aspects. (1) We employ a Convolutional Autoencoder to denoise galaxy images and the Adaptive Polar Coordinate Transformation to enhance the model's rotational invariance. (2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features. (3) We adopt a Bagging-based clustering model to cluster galaxies with similar features into distinct groups. By carefully dividing the redshift bins, we apply this model to the rest-frame optical images of galaxies in the COSMOS-Web field within the redshift range of $0.5 < z < 6.0$. Compared to the previous algorithm, the improved UML method successfully classifies 73\% galaxies. Using the GoogleNet algorithm, we classify the morphology of the remaining 27\% galaxies. To validate the reliability of our updated algorithm, we compared our classification results with other galaxy morphological parameters and found a good consistency with galaxy evolution. Benefiting from its higher efficiency, this updated algorithm is well-suited for application in future China Space Station Telescope missions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15015v1" target="_blank"><h2>Irradiation-Driven Formation of Supersoft X-ray Sources Following Classical Novae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Weitao Zhao, Xiangcun Meng, Yingzhen Cui, Yunlang Guo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages,4 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are characterized by persistent thermonuclear burning on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs).The standard model requires high mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-7}\, {\rm M_{\odot}}\,yr^{-1}$ from massive companions, presenting a theoretical impediment to the observed short-period SSSs, whose orbital periods imply low-mass donors theoretically incapable of sustaining such accretion.To resolve this paradox,we propose and demonstrate through detailed simulations that irradiative feedback following a classical nova (CN) eruption provides a natural formation channel.Through detailed binary evolution simulations with MESA, we reveal that sustained WD irradiation initially from the outburst and subsequently from accretion luminosity triggers significant and stable expansion of the low mass companion.This,in turn,drives mass-transfer rates into the stable hydrogen-burning regime and sustains it beyond $10^4$ years after the initiation of hydrogen burning.This mechanism robustly explains the observed population of short-period SSSs. Moreover,when irradiation-driven mass transfer rate drops below the stable accretion rate,it may lead to the rapid accumulation of sufficient material on shorter time scales to trigger a recurrent nova outburst instead of SSS, thereby also offering an explanation for the origin of short-period recurrent novae.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15010v1" target="_blank"><h2>GRBs and Relativistic Transients in the 2040s</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nikhil Sarin, Andrew Levan, Nial Tanvir, Simone Scaringi, Fabio Ragosta, Andrea Melandri, Paul Groot, Paul O'Brien, Paul Lasky, Samaya Nissanke, Alexander Heger, Steve Schulze<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, White paper for the ESO expanding horizons call<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe. The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up. This white paper demonstrates that without a dedicated large-aperture (10-30 m effective collecting area) time-domain facility with robotic scheduling and optical-NIR spectroscopic capabilities, the transformative potential of relativistic transient science in the 2040s will be considerably limited.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14913v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey(GRAMS) experiment <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14802v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical binary interactions in the 2040s</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nadejda Blagorodnova, Ondřej Pejcha, Tomek Kamiński, Yongzhi Cai, Kishalay De, Nancy Elias-Rosa, Jim Fuller, Hongwei Ge, David Jones, Stephen Justham, Viraj Karambelkar, Jakub Klencki, Elena Mason, Brian Metzger, Andrea Pastorello, Andrea Reguitti Friedrich Röpke, Steven Shore, Giorgio Valerin<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call for White Papers. 1 cover page and 3 pages of text<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dynamical binary interactions such as common envelope (CE) evolution or stellar mergers are a critical phase in the formation of a wide variety of binary phenomena, ranging from blue stragglers to type I supernovae (of all flavours, a, b and c), $γ$-ray bursts to bipolar planetary nebulae, Thorne-Zytkow objects to X-ray binaries. In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14800v1" target="_blank"><h2>White Dwarf Binaries: Probes of Future Astrophysics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anna F.

They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14592v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV scale with the Pierre Auger Observatory <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eva dos Santos<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> data-driven (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extensive air showers produced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays ($E > 10^{18}$ eV) in the Earth's atmosphere provide a challenging yet unique channel to probe hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV center-of-mass energy scale. Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory. With the advent of AugerPrime, we expect to deliver breakthrough results on the 100 TeV-scale hadronic interactions in the next decade.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14546v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy in the 2040s <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Samaya Nissanke, Nikhil Sarin, Chris Copperwheat, Sarah Antier, David Berge, Pablo Bosch, Archisman Ghosh, Paul Groot, Gregg Hallinan, Tanja Hinderer, Kenta Hotokezaka, Theophanes Karydas, Mansi Kasliwal, Yves Kini, Rubina Kotak, Kumiko Kotera, Marek Kowalski, Luke Krauth, Kruthi Krishna, Thomas Kupfer, Paraskevas Lampropoulos, Andrew Levan, Ioannis Liodis, Lea Marcotulli, Kunal Mooley, Silvia Piranomonte, Nanda Rea, Martin Roth, Simone Scaringi, Steve Schulze, Lami Suleiman, Nial Tanvir, Angela Zegarelli, Sylvia J.

White dwarfs provide a uniquely sensitive laboratory for studying the end stages of planetary-system evolution and for probing the bulk composition of both rocky and volatile-rich exoplanetary material. In the 2030s new facilities will transform our ability to carry out \textit{``industrial-scale''} astrophysics, leading to fundamental results and new challenges for the next decade. By combining the volume of data surveyed by the ESA {\em Gaia} mission and Vera C. Rubin Observatory with the next-generation of spectroscopic facilities, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) community will be in a position to obtain an unbiased census of evolved planetary systems, constrain the composition of thousands of disrupted planetesimals, and connect these signatures to Galactic populations and stellar birth environments. Thus, it is now the time for assessing those challenges and preparing for the future. This white paper outlines key science opportunities arising in the next decade and the technological requirements of future ESO facilities in enabling transformative discoveries in the 2040s. These future facilities will have to combine a number of features that are crucial for studying evolved planetary systems at white dwarfs, such as broad optical to near-infrared coverage, a high sensitivity at blue wavelengths, multi-resolution capability, massive multi-plexing, and time-domain reactivity.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14198v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fermi-LAT detections of novae V1723 Sco and V6598 Sgr <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> P.

Numerous classical novae have been observed to emit γ-rays (E > 100 MeV) detected by the Fermi-LAT. The prevailing hypothesis attributes this emission to the interaction of accelerated particles within shocks in the nova ejecta. However, the lack of non-thermal X-ray detection coincident with the γ-rays remains a challenge to this theory. Methods. We performed similar analyses of the Fermi-LAT data for both novae to determine the duration, localization, and spectral properties of the γ-ray emission. These results were compared with optical data from the AAVSO database and X-ray observations from NuSTAR, available for V1723 Sco 2024 only, to infer the nature of the accelerated particles. Finally, we used a physical emission model to extract key parameters related to particle acceleration. Results. V1723 Sco 2024 was found to be a very bright γ-ray source with an emission duration of 15 days allowing us to constrain the spectral index and the total energy of accelerated protons. Despite early NuSTAR observations, no non-thermal X-ray emission was detected simultaneously with the γ-rays. However, unexpected γ-ray and thermal hard X-ray emission were observed more than 40 days after the nova outburst, suggesting that particle acceleration can occur even several weeks post-eruption. V6598 Sgr 2023, on the other hand, was detected by the Fermi-LAT at a significance level of 4σover just two days, one of the shortest γ-ray emission durations ever recorded, coinciding with a rapid decline in optical brightness. Finally, the high ratio of γ-ray to optical luminosities and γ-ray to X-ray luminosities for both novae, as well as the curvature of the γ-ray spectrum of V1723 Sco below 500 MeV, are all more consistent with the hadronic than the leptonic scenario for γ-ray generation in novae.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13791v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the origins of high-velocity features in SNe Ia with the spectral synthesis code TARDIS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Luke Harvey, Kate Maguire, Alexander Holas, Joseph P.

The frequency and ubiquity of these components in silicon and calcium features specifically indicates that the mechanism through which they form must be common occurrence among the majority of SNe Ia. Here we present modelling of the HVF evolution in a sample of six well observed SNe Ia with the radiative-transfer code tardis. A base model is derived for each of the SNe to reproduce the photospheric velocity components, followed by a grid of simulations with Gaussian enhancements to the density profile at high velocities. We train a set of neural networks to emulate the impact of these density enhancements upon the simulated silicon line profile. These networks are subsequently used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to infer the density enhancement parameters that most closely reproduce the HVF evolution. While we obtain good matches for the silicon profile, we find that a single density enhancement alone cannot simultaneously produce the observed silicon and calcium HVF evolution. Our findings indicate that neither the delayed-detonation mechanism, nor the double-detonation mechanism can produce these HVFs, suggesting that something may be missing from the models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13688v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identification of periodicities with arbitrary shapes in AGN light curves <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lorenzo Bertassi, Maria Charisi, Riccardo Buscicchio, Fabio Rigamonti, Jessie Runnoe, Massimo Dotti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 14 figures, submitted to A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Massive black hole binaries are expected to be observable as periodic AGN in time-domain photometric surveys. Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13544v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Adam Smith, Maria Mylova, Carsten van de Bruck, C.

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $Λ$CDM cosmology, with the $χ^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3σ$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13395v2" target="_blank"><h2>Multiband neural network classification of ZTF light curves as LSST proxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tamás Szklenár, Attila Bódi, Róbert Szabó<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract), neural network (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this project we use data obtained by Zwicky Transient Facility to develop and test a neural-network-based, multiband classification algorithm to classify periodic variable stars (i.e. pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries). The aim is to utilize the algorithm on LSST data once they become available. Phase-folded light curve images and period information were used from five different variable star types: Classical and Type II Cepheids, δ Scuti stars, eclipsing binaries, and RR Lyrae stars. The data is taken from the 17th data release of ZTF, from which we used two passbands, g and r in this project.

For the training and testing process a supervised machine learning method was created, the neural network contains Convolutional Neural Networks concatenated with Fully Connected Layers.
  During the training-validation process the training accuracy reached 99% and the validation accuracy peaked at 95.6%.

We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ due to scatter. Our approach offers a fast, transparent alternative to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy for the bulk of the galaxy population.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13353v1" target="_blank"><h2>Super-resolving Herschel -- a deep learning based deconvolution and denoising technique <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dennis Koopmans, Lingyu Wang, Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Antonio La Marca, Matthieu Bethermin, Laura Bisigello, Zhen-Kao Gao, Claudia del P.

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $μ$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$μ$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$μ$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.
  We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $μ$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\lesssim$ 1" vs 12" pixel scale). Reliability is $\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $μ$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 25 papers (15 new, 10 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
