  Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Philipp Denzel, Yann Billeter, Frank-Peter Schilling, Elena Gavagnin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS, 21 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> attention (abstract), galaxy formation (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the first systematic study of multi-domain map-to-map translation
in galaxy formation simulations, leveraging deep generative models to predict
diverse galactic properties. Using high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical
simulation data, we compare conditional generative adversarial networks and
diffusion models under unified preprocessing and evaluation, optimizing
architectures and attention mechanisms for physical fidelity on galactic
scales. Our approach jointly addresses seven astrophysical domains - including
dark matter, gas, neutral hydrogen, stellar mass, temperature, and magnetic
field strength - while introducing physics-aware evaluation metrics that
quantify structural realism beyond standard computer vision measures. We
demonstrate that translation difficulty correlates with physical coupling,
achieving near-perfect fidelity for mappings from gas to dark matter and
mappings involving astro-chemical components such as total gas to HI content,
while identifying fundamental challenges in weakly constrained tasks such as
gas to stellar mass mappings. Our results establish GAN-based models as
competitive counterparts to state-of-the-art diffusion approaches at a fraction
of the computational cost (in training and inference), paving the way for
scalable, physics-aware generative frameworks for forward modelling and
observational reconstruction in the SKA era.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24087v1" target="_blank"><h2>CSST Slitless Spectra: Target Detection and Classification with YOLO</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yingying Zhou, Chao Liu, Hao Tian, Xin Zhang, Nan Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 12+6 figures. For high-resolution figures, please see the published version</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Addressing the spatial uncertainty and spectral blending challenges in CSST
slitless spectroscopy, we present a deep learning-driven, end-to-end framework
based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models. This approach directly detects,
classifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing
traditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both
compact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded
fields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy)
and discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins),
showcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing.
Our framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial
features holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection
precision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned
redshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a
paradigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification,
and preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will
concentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from
raw spectral traces.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24015v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing Cloud Formation and Evolution Through 3D Magnetic Field Mapping</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mehrnoosh Tahani, Laura Fissel, Enrique Lopez Rodriguez, Kate Pattle</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 2 Figures, GO PRIMA Submission</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose to use the unprecedented polarization sensitivity of PRIMA's
PRIMAger Polarization Imager and its high resolution in Band 1 (92 $\mu$m) to
map magnetic fields across two contrasting molecular cloud environments: the
well-studied Perseus cloud and the isolated Musca filament. This comparative
study will leverage the existing VLA radio observations that provide
line-of-sight magnetic field component of the Perseus cloud, along with
upcoming POSSUM survey results for Musca, to construct the first detailed 3D
magnetic field vector maps at sub-parsec resolution. Perseus, with its known
formation history through interstellar structure (e.g., bubble) interactions,
will reveal how magnetic fields evolve during active star formation phases,
while Musca, an isolated filament with lower star-formation activity, will show
magnetic field morphology in early evolutionary stages. With PRIMA's resolution
of 0.01 pc for Perseus and $<0.01$ pc for Musca, we will resolve magnetic field
structures at scales necessary for understanding cloud fragmentation and star
formation efficiency, and the roles that magnetic fields play in these
processes. Our survey will require approximately 1438 hours to cover 42 deg$^2$
of Perseus and 12 deg$^2$ of Musca. With this, we aim to provide the first
comprehensive view of how environment and evolutionary state may influence
magnetic field evolution in molecular clouds and how magnetic fields influence
cloud formation, fragmentation, and star formation.</p></br></body>
