  Astrophysics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fabian Schüssler, B. Cornejo, M. Costa, I. Jaroschewski, W. Kiendrébéogo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Proceedings of the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The detection of transient phenomena such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast
Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares, novae, and supernovae, alongside novel
cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, has
transformed astrophysics in recent years. Maximizing the discovery potential of
multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as
serendipitous detections, requires a tool that rapidly compiles and
contextualizes relevant information for each new event. We present
Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.
  Astro-COLIBRI integrates a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a
cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly clients (a website and mobile apps
for iOS and Android). It processes astronomical alerts from multiple streams in
real time, filtering them based on user-defined criteria and placing them in
their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context. The platform offers
intuitive data visualization, a quick summary of relevant event properties, and
an assessment of observing conditions at numerous observatories worldwide.
  We here describe its architecture, data resources, and main functionalities.
We highlight the automatic collection of photometric data from a variety of
large scale optical surveys, a recently added feature that significantly
improves the capabilities of the Astro-COLIBRI platform.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06688v1" target="_blank"><h2>Denoising radio pulses from air showers using machine-learning methods</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aurélien Benoit-Lévy, Zhisen Lai, Oscar Macias, Arsène Ferrière</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023). 10 pages, 6 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> convolutional (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect radio
signals from extensive air showers (EAS) caused by ultra-high-energy (UHE)
cosmic particles. Galactic, hardware-like, and anthropogenic noise are expected
to contaminate these signals. To address this problem, we propose training a
supervised convolutional network known as an encoder-decoder. This network is
used to learn a coded representation of the data and remove specific features
from it. This denoiser is trained using high-fidelity air shower simulations
specifically tailored to replicate the characteristics of signals detected by
GRAND. In this contribution, we describe our machine-learning model and report
initial results demonstrating the sensitivity enhancement resulting from our
denoising algorithm when applied to realistically simulated GRAND signals with
varying signal-to-noise ratios.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06357v1" target="_blank"><h2>Differentiable Stellar Atmospheres with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiadong Li, Mingjie Jian, Yuan-Sen Ting, Gregory M.

addressing a critical bottleneck in differentiable stellar spectroscopy. By
incorporating hydrostatic equilibrium as a physical constraint during training,
Kurucz-a1 creates a differentiable atmospheric structure solver that maintains
physical consistency while achieving computational efficiency. Kurucz-a1 can
achieve superior hydrostatic equilibrium and more consistent with the solar
observed spectra compared to ATLAS-12 itself, demonstrating the advantages of
modern optimization techniques. Combined with modern differentiable radiative
transfer codes, this approach enables data-driven optimization of universal
physical parameters across diverse stellar populations-a capability essential
for next-generation stellar astrophysics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06666v1" target="_blank"><h2>Using End-to-End Optimized Summary Statistics to Improve IceCube's
  Diffuse Galactic Fits</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Oliver Janik, Christian Haack</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Characterizing the astrophysical neutrino flux with the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory traditionally relies on a binned forward-folding likelihood
approach. Insufficient Monte Carlo (MC) statistics in each bin limits the
granularity and dimensionality of the binning scheme. A neural network can be
employed to optimize a summary statistic that serves as the input for data
analysis, yielding the best possible outcomes. This end-to-end optimized
summary statistic allows for the inclusion of more observables while
maintaining adequate MC statistics per bin. This work will detail the
application of end-to-end optimized summary statistics in analyzing and
characterizing the galactic neutrino flux, achieving improved resolution in the
likelihood contours for selected signal parameters and models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06516v1" target="_blank"><h2>Instance-Wise Monotonic Calibration by Constrained Transformation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yunrui Zhang, Gustavo Batista, Salil S. Kanhere</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> cs.LG, stat.ML</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> neural network (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Deep neural networks often produce miscalibrated probability estimates,
leading to overconfident predictions. A common approach for calibration is
fitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms
predicted probabilities. A key desirable property of the calibration map is
instance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability
outputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee
monotonicity. Previous monotonic approaches either use an under-parameterized
calibration map with limited expressive ability or rely on black-box neural
networks, which lack interpretability and robustness. In this paper, we propose
a family of novel monotonic post-hoc calibration methods, which employs a
constrained calibration map parameterized linearly with respect to the number
of classes. Our proposed approach ensures expressiveness, robustness, and
interpretability while preserving the relative ordering of the probability
output by formulating the proposed calibration map as a constrained
optimization problem. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance
across datasets with different deep neural network models, outperforming
existing calibration methods while being data and computation-efficient. Our
