F. Mingarelli</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Pulsar Timing Array experiments are rapidly approaching the era of
gravitational wave background anisotropy detection. The timing residuals of
each pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across
all angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars,
current analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the
background at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the
integrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a
previously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map
reconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale
leakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at
scales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into
large-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred
angular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of
scales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry
of the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of
different regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the
quality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of
small-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and
characterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical
formalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this
systematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25596v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining baryonic feedback and cosmology from DES Y3 and Planck PR4
  6$\times$2pt data. I. $Λ$CDM models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiachuan Xu, Tim Eifler, Elisabeth Krause, Vivian Miranda, Jaime Salcido, Ian McCarthy</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), feedback (title, abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We combine weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB)
lensing, and their cross-correlations (so-called 6$\times$2pt) to constrain
cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios using data from the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) Y3 Maglim catalog and the Planck satellite PR4 data release. We
include all data points in the DES Y3 cosmic shear two-point correlation
function (2PCF) down to 2.$^\prime$5 and model baryonic feedback processes via
principal components (PCs) that are constructed from the ANTILLES simulations.
We find a tight correlation between the amplitude of the first PC $Q_1$ and
mean normalized baryon mass fraction
$\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}=\bar{f}_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/\Omega_\mathrm{m})$
from the ANTILLES simulations and employ an independent $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$
measurement from Akino et al. (2022) as a prior of $Q_1$. We train a neural
network $6\times2$pt emulator to boost the analysis speed by
$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, which enables us to run an impressive number of simulated
analyses to validate our analysis against various systematics. For our
6$\times$2pt analysis, we find $S_8=0.8073\pm0.0094$ when including a $Q_1$
prior from $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ observations. This level of cosmological
constraining power allows us to put tight constraints on the strength of
baryonic feedback. We find $Q_1=0.025^{+0.024}_{-0.029}$ for our 6$\times$2pt
analysis and $Q_1=0.043\pm{0.016}$ when combining with external information
from Planck, ACT, DESI. All these results indicate weak feedback, e.g., the
tensions to Illustris ($Q_1=0.095$) and OWLS AGN T8.7 ($Q_1=0.137$) are
2.9$\sigma$-3.3$\sigma$ and 4.7$\sigma$-5.9$\sigma$, respectively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24159v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-supervised Synthetic Pretraining for Inference of Stellar Mass
  Embedded in Dense Gas</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Keiya Hirashima, Shingo Nozaki, Naoto Harada</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, accepted for NeurIPS 2025 ML4PS workshop</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> transformer (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and
evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions
is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions
are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable.
Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass,
but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution
magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive.
We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic
fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying
the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results
demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression
stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better
than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal
component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically
meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised
segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or
fine-tuning.</p></br></body>
