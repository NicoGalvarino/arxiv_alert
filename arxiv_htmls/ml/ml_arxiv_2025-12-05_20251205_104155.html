From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $ζ[ζ_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $δN$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04946v1" target="_blank"><h2>MALLORN: Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dylan Magill, Matt Nicholl, Vysakh Anilkumar, Sjoert van Velzen, Xinyue Sheng, Thai Son Mai, Hung Viet Tran, Ngoc Phu Doan, Thomas Moore, Shubham Srivastav, David R.

Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04804v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with MUSE <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alessandro Veutro, Irene Di Palma, Marco Drago, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Robin van der Laag, Melissa López, Fulvio Ricci<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract), convolutional (abstract), neural network (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life can give rise to one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe. Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope. Among the three detector geometries considered here, the 2L with a relative inclination of $45^\circ$ is the one achieving the best results, thus being able to detect a Kuroda2016-like waveform with an efficiency above $90\%$ at 50 kpc.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04508v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chlorine and Potassium Enrichment in the Cassiopeia A Supernova Remnant <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> XRISM collaboration<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$σ$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04378v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mini-supernovae from white dwarf-neutron star mergers: Viewing-angle-dependent spectra and lightcurves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yacheng Kang, Jin-Ping Zhu, Lijing Shao, Jiahang Zhong, Jinghao Zhang, Bing Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.SR<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under final review at A&A after minor revisions, 14 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> VAE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Unstable mass transfer may occur during white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) mergers, in which the WD can be tidally disrupted and form an accretion disk around the NS. Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation.
  We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using "mini-supernovae" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04327v1" target="_blank"><h2>A distance measurement for blazar TXS 0506+056 using its radio variability and very long baseline images</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chanwoo Song, Sang-Sung Lee, Sincheol Kang, Whee Yeon Cheong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> causality (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the results of constraining the angular diameter distance to blazar TXS 0506+056. We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $Λ$CDM model within 1$σ$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $Λ$CDM distance of $948.2\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $Λ$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04145v1" target="_blank"><h2>Minuet: A Diffusion Autoencoder for Compact Semantic Compression of Multi-Band Galaxy Images</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alexander T.

Rubin Observatory is slated to observe nearly 20 billion galaxies during its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z<1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04031v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large Language Models for Limited Noisy Data: A Gravitational Wave Identification Study <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yixuan Li, Yuhao Lu, Yang Liu, Liang Li, R.

Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04010v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hydrogen-Rich to Stripped-Envelope:Observational Continuity and Biases in CCSNe <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anjasha Gangopadhyay, Priscila J.

We discuss the physical processes-stellar winds, binary interaction, eruptive outbursts, and circumstellar interaction-that may produce graded outcomes across classes, while highlighting where observational evidence supports or challenges smooth transitions. We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries.

We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $λ$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $θ$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 10 papers (3 new, 7 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
