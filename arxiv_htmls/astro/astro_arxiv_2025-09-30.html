absorption lines (AALs) in quasars. We present a case study of the quasar
J014741-030247 at $z \sim$ 4.75, which hosts complex intrinsic absorption lines
revealed by the high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectrum obtained from the
HIERACHY program. We focus on one of the strongest absorption systems ($z$
$\sim$ 4.7804) and determine the column densities of multiple ionization
species. We find that the Apparent Optical Depth method may significantly
underestimate the column densities of high ions. Decomposing the absorption
into multiple components yields a better fit and reveals clear evidence of
partial coverage. The variation in covering fractions among different ions
suggests that high ions are distributed more extensively in this system. We
estimate electron densities of different components ($630 - 4070 \
\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), these are based on the column densities of \ion{Si}{2}* and
\ion{C}{2}*. By combining these with the hydrogen number density and ionization
parameter derived from photoionization modeling, we infer that the different
components are located at distances of 2.3 to 9.5 kpc from the quasar. The
derived $N_{\mathrm H} / n_{\mathrm e}$ and the partial coverage observed in
low ions all require cloud sizes smaller than 1 pc, even down to 0.01 pc.
Finally, the low kinetic luminosity of the gas ($< 0.5\% L_\mathrm{bol}$)
indicates that it is insufficient to drive significant AGN feedback and may
only suppress star formation via `multistage' mechanism.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24270v1" target="_blank"><h2>Collisional Baryon-Dominated Dwarf Galaxies: A New Probe of Bursty
  Feedback and Dark Matter Physics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yi-Ying Wang, Daneng Yang, Keyu Lu, Yue-Lin Sming Tsai, Yi-Zhong Fan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 9 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> feedback (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a
promising formation channel for baryon-dominated dwarf galaxies (BDDGs). Using
hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding
energy, $|E_{\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential
fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\rm
bind}|$ by $\approx 15\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive BDDGs.
By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter produces comparable cores
without lowering $|E_{\rm bind}|$, resulting in negligible effect. This
provides a novel way to distinguish between two leading galactic core formation
channels, i.e., the baryon feedback and elastic dark matter self-interaction.
Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher BDDG masses in the
weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $>100\%$ mass enhancements.
The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to
sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational
signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and
kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24939v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGN hosting jets. I: A semi-analytical model for the evolution of radio

understand the evolution of jets and radio galaxies in detail. However,
computationally demanding as they are, their use is limited to a relatively
small number of representative cases. When comparing to the distribution of
large samples of objects in the luminosity-distance plane (P-D plane), the most
efficient approach is to use analytical or semi-analytical models that
reproduce the evolution of the main parameters governing the dynamics and radio
luminosity of the sources. Our aim is to build a semi-analytical model that
allows us to produce mock samples of radio galaxies to be compared with real
populations and use this approach to constrain the general properties of active
galaxies with jets in a cosmological context. In this work, we present a new
model for the evolution of radio galaxies based on the resolution of ordinary
differential equations and inspired both by previous experience on numerical
simulations of jets across several orders of magnitude in power, and by
observational evidence. Our results show remarkable agreement between the
results given by the semi-analytical model and those obtained by both 2D and 3D
relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets ranging from 1.e35 W to 1.e39 W.
From the derived trajectories of powerful radio galaxies through the P-D
diagram (powers greater than 1.e36 W), our model agrees with typical lifetimes
of galactic activity of < 500 Myr. We also compare our results with previous
models in the literature. In a follow-up paper, we use this model to generate
mock populations of radio galaxies at low redshifts and compare them to the
LoTSS sample.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23549v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of Cosmic Filaments on Galaxy Morphological Evolution and

large-scale cosmic web shapes galaxy morphology and to forecast the early
cosmic web structure that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal. In
the hydrodynamic TNG50 and $N$-body TNG50-Dark runs, we reconstruct the cosmic
web at redshifts $z=0$, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the Monte Carlo Physarum
Machine density estimator and the DisPerSE structure identification framework.
We confirm that dark matter halos start out predominantly prolate (elongated)
and their shapes are aligned with their nearest filaments; prolate galaxies
retain strong shape-alignment with their outer halos to later times. The
fraction of prolate galaxies and halos increases toward lower stellar mass,
higher redshift, and lower-density filaments. Oblate and spheroidal galaxies
show weaker trends with filament density, but spheroidal halos preferentially
reside in higher-density filaments. We also find that higher-density filaments
favor extended rotationally-supported disks, whereas lower-density filaments
more often host smaller dispersion-supported systems. Then, generating mock
galaxy samples from TNG100 and TNG50, we predict the early cosmic web
accessible to Roman. We find that the spectroscopic emission-line depth planned
for the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey (HLWAS) yields a highly incomplete
galaxy sample that does not accurately trace the $z=1$ cosmic web. A survey
$\geq2.5\times$ deeper over a few square degrees would enable a proper
reconstruction and reveal qualitatively correct filament-galaxy morphology
relationships. Nevertheless, the planned HLWAS Deep field should still identify
most galaxy overdensities; targeted deeper spectroscopy of these regions would
efficiently and adequately map the early filamentary structure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24211v1" target="_blank"><h2>Far-infrared lines hidden in archival deep multi-wavelength surveys:

in star-forming galaxies, and hence an excellent tracer of the evolution of
cosmic star formation. Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter
surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\mu$m, hidden in the much
brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\mu$m
line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by
tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep
maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after
subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED).
  We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\mu$m signal from the
three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\pm10.2$, $11.0\pm8.7$, $9.6\pm9.8$, and
$9.2\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\sim 0.65$, $\sim1.3$, $\sim2.1$, and
$\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\sigma$ significance in each
bin. Our $3\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\sim2.6$ results
from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and
indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\sim\times7.5$) of mean [CII]
intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation
models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We
discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys
(TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having
demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology
to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods
can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place
upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24881v1" target="_blank"><h2>The first GLIMPSE of the faint galaxy population at Cosmic Dawn with

gravitational lensing of the AbellS1063 cluster, we investigate the faintest
galaxies ever observed in the redshift range z~9 to z~15. We identify 105
galaxy candidates within this range, spanning absolute ultraviolet (UV)
magnitudes from M_UV~-18 to M_UV~-13 mag, about three magnitudes fainter, on
average, than prior JWST studies. We place strong constraints on the
ultra-faint end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF), finding minimal evolution
in the faint-end slope, which varies from $\alpha=-2.01\pm0.20 at z=9 to
\alpha=-2.10\pm0.19$ at z=13. This behaviour contrasts with the rapid evolution
of the faint-end slope observed from z~0 to z~9. By integrating the UVLF down
to M_UV=-16, we derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD)from z=9 to
z=13, revealing a best-fit redshift evolution that follows
$\propto(1+z)^{-2.94^{+0.06}_{-0.10}}$. This slope is significantly shallower
than predictions from most theoretical models. Extending the integration limit
to M_UV=-13, we find that galaxies fainter than M_UV=-16 contribute more than
50% of the total cosmic SFR density at z~12. The observed excess in the cosmic
SFRD at these high redshifts may suggest an enhancement in the star formation
efficiency during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. Alternatively, this
could result from other physical mechanisms, such as bursty star formation
histories; minimal dust attenuation; or an evolving initial mass function.
However, existing models that incorporate these scenarios fail to fully
reproduce the observed redshift evolution of SFRD. Finally, we acknowledge the
potential impact of low-redshift contamination and cosmic variance, as the
small survey volume may not represent the broader galaxy population. Similar
observations in different fields and spectroscopic confirmation are required to
validate these findings</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22783v1" target="_blank"><h2>A New Sample of Dwarf Galaxies with X-ray-Selected AGN Candidates from

dwarf galaxy positions in the NASA-Sloan Atlas with X-ray sources from eRASS
and apply rigorous criteria to remove contaminants such as background sources,
galaxies with dubious stellar masses, and X-ray binaries. Potential
contamination from ultraluminous X-ray sources is also assessed. We ultimately
assemble a sample of 27 X-ray-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with
stellar masses $M_{*} = 10^{7.5-9.5} M_{\odot}$ and redshifts $z<0.15$. An
analysis of the host galaxy properties reveals that the AGN candidates are
predominantly situated in systems with $g-r$ colors, star formation rates, and
concentrations typical of the broader dwarf galaxy population. Detailed
examination of the X-ray sources indicates that most AGN candidates in our

our methodology identifies 15 previously unreported AGNs candidates,

  Using Semi-Supervised Methods</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhijian Luo, Jianzhen Chen, Wenxiang Pei, Hubing Xiao, Shaohua Zhang, Qifan Cui, Chenggang Shu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract), dust (title, abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dust-lane spheroidal galaxies (DLSGs) are unique astrophysical systems that
exhibit the morphology of early-type galaxies (ETGs) but are distinguished by
prominent dust lanes. Recent studies propose that they form through minor
mergers between ETGs and gas-rich dwarf galaxies, offering a window into the
interstellar medium (ISM) of ETGs and star formation triggered by small-scale
interactions. However, their rarity poses a challenge for assembling large,
statistically robust samples via manual selection. To overcome this limitation,
we employ GC-SWGAN, a semi-supervised learning method developed by
\citet{2025ApJS..279...17L}, to systematically identify DLSGs within the DESI
Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS). The methodology involves training a
generative adversarial network (GAN) on unlabeled galaxy images to extract
morphological features, followed by fine-tuning the model using a small dataset
of labeled DLSGs. In our experiments, despite DLSGs constituting only $\sim$
3.7\% of the test set, GC-SWGAN achieves remarkable performance, with an 87\%
recall rate, 84\% accuracy, and an F1 score of 86\%, underscoring its efficacy
for DLSG detection. Applying this model to $\sim$ 310,000 DESI-LS galaxies that
meet the criteria $m_r < 17.0$ and $0.01 < z < 0.07$ we compile the largest
catalog of DLSG candidates to date, identifying 9,482 dust-lane ETGs. A
preliminary analysis reveals that these DLSGs exhibit significantly redder
$g-r$ colors and higher specific star formation rates compared to non-DLSGs.
This catalog enables future studies of ISM properties in ETGs and the role of
minor mergers in driving star formation in the nearby universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23066v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-wavelength probes of the Milky Way's Cold Interstellar Medium:

(KI) absorption from the radio and optical surveys, GASKAP and GALAH, to study
the physical and kinematic properties of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in
the Milky Way foreground towards the Magellanic Clouds. By comparing GASKAP HI
absorption with interstellar KI absorption detected in GALAH spectra of nearby
stars (within 12 arcmin angular distance or a spatial separation of ~0.75 pc),
we reveal a strong kinematic correlation between these two tracers of the cold
neutral ISM. The velocity offsets between matched HI and KI absorption
components are small, with a mean (median) offset of -1.3 (-1.2) km s-1 and a
standard deviation of 2.3 km s-1. The high degree of kinematic consistency
suggests a close spatial association between Ki and cold HI gas. Correlation
analyses reveal a moderate positive relationship between HI and KI
line-of-sight properties, such as KI column density with HI column density or
HI brightness temperature. We observe a ~63% overlap in the detection of both
species towards 290 (out of 462) GASKAP HI absorption lines of sight, and
estimate a median KI/HI abundance ratio of ~2.3 x 10^(-10), in excellent

the unique conditions at "Cosmic Dawn," which are set by the underlying
cosmological model and early baryonic physics. Observations suggest that
high-$z$ star clusters reached stellar surface densities above $10^5 M_\odot$
pc$^{-2}$, suggesting scenarios where models predict that the ability of
stellar feedback to counter gravitational collapse is severely limited. We
investigate the first star clusters in a suite of AREPO simulations, which
explore the capacity for $\Lambda$CDM halos to maximally form high-density
systems without feedback. We include the effects of the supersonic baryon-dark
matter streaming velocity, an effect that impacts gas density and distribution
in early minihalos. We show that early star clusters can reach high densities
even in regions of strong supersonic streaming, provided feedback is weak. We
analyze the interplay of the stream velocity and the dynamical processes of
structure formation, finding that JWST has the opportunity to detect the
brightest, most massive objects in our computational box. The detection of
individual $z\geq12$ Pop III star clusters below $10^7M_\odot$ is challenging,
although lensing could reveal these objects in rare configurations, especially
if a top-heavy IMF is present. We find that accounting for baryonic clusters
separately from dark matter halos complicates predictions for the faint-end of
the high-$z$ UVLF, with competing effects from the stream velocity and low-mass
clusters outside of halos. Finally, we explore clustering of star clusters as a
promising probe of the stream velocity in these systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23897v1" target="_blank"><h2>Aligned Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN disks revealed by GWTC-4</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yin-Jie Li, Yuan-Zhu Wang, Shao-Peng Tang, Yi-Zhong Fan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 8 figures, comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for

and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation
characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass

spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution
is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events
account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation,
corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3}

Survey data of over four thousand galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2

40 to 60 kpc from the CG center, with a mild dependence on cluster richness.
This feature resembles the density transition caused by the splashback effect
at the outskirts of galaxy clusters, when accreted matter reaches the apocenter
for the first time. We turn to the IllustrisTNG hydro-dynamic simulation to
gain theoretical insights. Density bumps, shells and accretion streaks are
identified in the diffuse stellar content of the CGs and intra-cluster light
which relate to the recent history of disruption and accretion. These features
occur at the outskirts of the CGs, up to several hundred kiloparsecs from the

barred galaxies across the three different galaxy environments in terms of
color and magnitude, the median bar radii were found to be 2.54 +/- 0.34 kpc,
3.29 +/- 0.38 kpc, and 4.44 +/- 0.81 kpc in the cluster, filaments, and field
environments, respectively. In addition, the median bar radii scaled by the
disk scale lengths was found to be 1.26 +/- 0.09, 1.72 +/- 0.11, and 2.57 +/-
0.21 in the cluster, filaments, and field environments, respectively. These
results indicate that the galaxy environment has a significant influence on the
structural parameters of bars, with bars in high-density environments being
shorter and less prominent than those in the field. Conclusions. Our findings
can be interpreted in terms of a slowing of the secular evolution of bars in
dense galaxy environments. Barred galaxies located in clusters could experience
a reduced rate of bar secular evolution due to various physical processes that
occur in high-density environments, such as gas stripping, strangulation, or
tidal interactions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22789v1" target="_blank"><h2>Masses, Star-Formation Efficiencies, and Dynamical Evolution of 18,000

regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies by combining data from JWST,
HST, MUSE, ALMA, VLA, and MeerKAT from the multi-wavelength PHANGS survey. We
report 10 pc-scale measurements of the mass of young stars, ionized gas, and
older disk stars coincident with each HII region, as well as the initial and
current mass of molecular gas, atomic gas, and swept-up shell material,
estimated from lower resolution data. We find that the mass of older stars
dominates over young stars at $\gtrsim10\rm\,pc$ scales, and ionized gas
exceeds the stellar mass in most optically bright HII regions. Combining our
mass measurements for a statistically large sample of HII regions, we derive 10
pc scale star-formation efficiencies $\approx6{-}17\%$ for individual HII
regions. Comparing each region's self-gravity with the ambient ISM pressure and
total pressure from pre-supernova stellar feedback, we show that most optically
bright HII regions are over-pressured relative to their own self-gravity and
the ambient ISM pressure, and that they are hence likely expanding into their
surroundings. Larger HII regions in galaxy centers approach dynamical
equilibrium. The self-gravity of regions is expected to dominate over
pre-supernova stellar feedback pressure at $\gtrsim130\rm\,pc$ and $60\rm\,pc$
scales in galaxy disks and centers, respectively, but is always sub-dominant to
the ambient ISM pressure on HII region scales. Our measurements have direct
implications for the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions and the
efficiency of stellar feedback in ionizing and clearing cold gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22800v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing the star cluster populations in Stephan's Quintet using

significant star formation activity. A history of tidal interactions between
its four member galaxies and a recent collision between an intruder galaxy and
the original group are associated with active star formation, particularly in
many shocked regions in the intra-group medium. Using an existing star cluster
candidate (SCC) catalog constructed from HST UV/optical images, we integrate
flux measurements from five near-infrared filters (F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W,
F356W) obtained from JWST NIRCam observations in 2022. Leveraging the extended
photometric baseline from HST and JWST, spanning ~300 nm to ~3500 nm, we
perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the CIGALE code to
derive reliable estimates of age, mass, and extinction for the 1,588
high-confidence SCCs. We confirm earlier results that very young SCCs (~a few
Myr) are predominantly located along previously identified shock regions near
the merging galaxies, while older (>100 Myr) and globular clusters are more
widely distributed. Our analysis shows that NIR photometry helps break the
age-extinction degeneracy, reclassifying many SCCs from older to younger,
moderately dust-extincted clusters when added to HST-based SED fits. We also
observe a strong spatial correlation between young clusters and CO-traced
molecular gas, although active star formation is present in several regions
with no detectable CO. We find that the two prominent epochs of star formation,
around 5 Myr and 200 Myr, correspond to the two major interaction events in SQ
that gave rise to the observed extended tidal features.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22871v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the Star Formation Main Sequence down to 10$^{7} M_\odot$ at $1

scaling relation that provides a global framework for studying galaxy formation
and evolution, as well as insight into the complex star formation histories
(SFHs) of individual galaxies. In this work, we combine large-area pre-JWST
surveys (COSMOS2020, CANDELS), which probe high-$M_\star$ sources
(${>10^9\,M_\odot}$), with SHARDS/CANDELS FAINT and JWST data from CANUCS,
CEERS, JADES, and UNCOVER, to obtain a high-$z$, star formation rate (SFR) and
stellar mass ($M_\star$) complete sample spanning both high- and low-$M_\star$
regimes. Completeness in both $M_\star$ and SFR is key to avoiding biases
introduced by low-mass, highly star-forming objects. Our combined data set is
80% complete down to $10^{7.6}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim1$ ($10^{8.8}\,M_\odot$ at
$z\sim9$). The overall intrinsic MS slope (based on the SFR$_{100}$ and
$M_\star$ derived with Dense Basis and nonparametric SFHs) shows little
evolution up to $z\sim5$, with values $\sim0.7 - 0.8$. The slope in the
low-$M_\star$ regime becomes steeper than that in the high-$M_\star$ end at
least up to $z\sim5$, but the strength of this change is highly dependent on
the assumptions made on the symmetry of the uncertainties in $M_\star$ and SFR.
If real, the steepening suggests reduced star formation efficiency or declining
gas content with decreasing $M_\star$. The transition between the low-$M_\star$
regime and the canonical MS occurs around $10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, independent of
$z$. This critical value may coincide with the assembly of galaxies' disks,
which can provide a mechanism for self-regulation that stabilizes them against
feedback. The intrinsic scatter is compatible with canonical estimates, also at
low-$M_\star$, ranging from $0.2-0.3$ dex. This is indicative of rapid
variations in star formation being averaged out over $\lesssim100$ Myr.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22797v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the origin of the X-ray and optical emission in the z=3.1

lensed into four images and was discovered with the second Data Release of the

The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the
Milky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on
the initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models
tailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in
the Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of
Praesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the
mass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model,
we investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail.
Methods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of
Praesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents
one star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and
the initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based
on this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars
in the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes.
Results. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated
star formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion,
adopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially
7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass
segregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the
self-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular
momentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping
is about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc,
where tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift
of the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect
is not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23298v1" target="_blank"><h2>The origin of double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies in MaNGA

unique galaxies in MaNGA survey. These DPGs show double-peaked Balmer lines and
forbidden lines in the spectra. We use a double Gaussian model to separate the
double-peaked profiles of each emission line into blue and red components
($\lambda_\text{blue}$ < $\lambda_\text{red}$), and analyze the spatially
resolved kinematics and ionization mechanisms of each component. We find that
in 35 out of 36 DPGs, the flux ratio between the blue and red components varies
systematically along the major axes, while it keeps roughly a constant along
the minor axes. The blue and red components of these DPGs exhibit similar
distributions in both the value of line-of-sight velocity and the velocity
dispersion. Additionally, 83.3% DPGs have both blue and red components located
in the same ionization region in the [SII]-BPT diagram. Combining all these
observational results, we suggest that the double-peaked emission line profiles
in these 35 DPGs primarily originate from rotating discs. The remaining one
galaxy shows clear outflow features. 8 out of 35 DPGs show symmetric line
profiles that indicate undisturbed rotating discs, and the other 27 DPGs
exhibit asymmetric profiles, suggesting dynamic disturbances in the rotating
discs. Furthermore, we find that 58.3% DPGs experienced external processes,
characterized by tidal features, companion galaxies, as well as gas-star
misalignments. This fraction is about twice as much as that of the control
sample, suggesting the origin of double-peaked emission line profiles is
associated with external processes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24904v1" target="_blank"><h2>Graph-based Analysis for Revealing the Stochastic Gravitational Wave

information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs)
are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency
range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar
timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its
parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and
analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and
geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic
datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and
the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our
results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection
consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation.
The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then
exclusion of non-Hellings \& Downs templates is performed by the second
cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim
40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our
graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim
1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of
$\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$,
respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the
$3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav

astrometric measurements of the maser sources by very long baseline
interferometer (VLBI) observations and the GAIA result. We combined them to
construct a unified RC from $R=0$ to $\sim 25$ kpc and decomposed the curve
into bulge, disc and dark halo components with high precision. The dark matter
density near the Sun is estimated to be $0.107 \pm 0.003$ GeV cm$^{-3}$. We
present the RC as ascii tables for the solar constants of $(R_0,V_0)=(8.178

eastern ($l\ge 0^\circ$) and western ($< 0^\circ$) RCs in the HI and CO lines,
which allowed the creation of an E/W asymmetry curve of the velocity
difference. The E/W asymmetry is fitted by a sinusoidal function of the radius

or major axis alignment, we use spin as a direct, dynamically motivated probe.
To match the limitations of observational data, the group spin, central-galaxy
spin, and alignment angle are defined and measured in projection on the sky
plane. By applying two novel spin estimators for galaxy groups, we find strong
statistical evidence for a preferential alignment, with a mean projected angle
of $34.17^\circ \pm 0.29^\circ$, significantly deviating from random
expectation at $37.77\sigma$. This alignment signal persists across a wide
range of group and galaxy properties, but its strength is modulated by mass,
morphology, and color. Specifically, we find that more massive groups and more
massive central galaxies exhibit stronger alignment. Furthermore, elliptical
central galaxies show stronger alignment than spirals, and bluer central
galaxies are more strongly aligned than redder ones. Our results suggest a
close dynamical link between the spin of central galaxies and their host
groups, modulated by their physical properties and star formation history.
These results provide new insights into the dynamical connection between

with the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers -
unavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars.
However, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a
third of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs
in giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could
explain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major
merger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a
gravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two
competing effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become
bound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil
velocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls
back due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities.
At intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become
important, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background
stellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the
galaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have
realistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to
observed systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing
SMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable
colors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low
ellipticities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24543v1" target="_blank"><h2>A machine learning approach to axion-like particle searches in CTAO

spectra of blazars: a superimposition of energy-dependent "wiggles" on the
spectral shape, and a hardening at high (multi-TeV) energies, due to the ALP
beam eluding absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). The
enhanced energy resolution of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO)

samples at $z \in [2,6]$ derived from the COSMOS2020 and SC4K catalogs, we
trained gradient-boosting machine-learning algorithms (LGBM, XGBoost, and
CatBoost) using optical and near-infrared broadband photometry. To ensure
balanced performance, the models were trained on carefully selected datasets
with similar redshift and i-band magnitude distributions. Additionally, the
models were tested for robustness by perturbing the photometric data using the
associated observational uncertainties. Our classification models achieved
F1-scores of $\sim 87\%$ and successfully identified about $7,000$ objects with
an unanimous agreement across all models. This more than doubles the number of
LAEs identified in the COSMOS field compared with the SC4K dataset. We managed
to spectroscopically confirm 60 of these LAE candidates using the publicly

of machine learning in efficiently identifying LAEs candidates. This lays the
foundations for applications to larger photometric surveys, such as Euclid and
LSST. By complementing traditional approaches and providing robust preselection
capabilities, our models facilitate the analysis of these objects. This is
crucial to increase our knowledge of the overall LAE population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24010v1" target="_blank"><h2>Search for Distant Hypervelocity Star Candidates Using RR Lyrae Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Haozhu Fu, Yang Huang, Huawei Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), LLS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars with velocities exceeding their local
escape velocities. Searching for HVSs and studying their origins can be an
important way to study the properties of the Milky Way. In this paper, we
utilize precise distances for RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) derived from the
period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) relation, along with proper motions
from Gaia DR3, to conduct a large-volume search for HVSs. Our sample consists
of a catalog with 8,172 RRLs with metallicity, distance and radial velocities
estimated from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopic data, and an extended catalog of
135,873 RRLs with metallicity and distance estimated from Gaia photometry.
After careful quality cuts, 165 hypervelocity RRL candidates were found. We
performed further checks on their light curves, and selected the most reliable
87 hypervelocity RRLs. All of them exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity in
the tangential component. Among them, 7 stars have tangential velocity over 800
km s^-1. We identified two spatially distinct distributions of hypervelocity
RRLs: one concentrated toward the Galactic Center and another localized around
the Magellanic Clouds, suggesting that their origins are likely associated with
these regions through the Hills or other mechanisms. Furthermore, we detected a
significant number of RRLs associated with dwarf galaxies that exceed the Milky
Way's escape velocity, likely ejected from their host systems. Future Gaia
releases and spectroscopic follow-up observations will provide further insight
into their ejection origin.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23345v1" target="_blank"><h2>Closure Relations of Synchrotron Self-Compton from Reverse shock and
  Fermi-LAT GRBs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nissim Fraija, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, Antonio Galván Gámez, Maria G. Dainotti, Hermes León Vargas</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 34 pages, 10 figures, Accepted in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Synchrotron radiation from the reverse- and forward-shock regions typically
describes the evolution of temporal and spectral features given by the closure
relations (CRs) during the late and long-/short-lasting emission in the
afterglow phase of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Although synchrotron photons are
restricted to keV and a few MeV energies, the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
mechanism can disperse them above hundreds of MeV energies. We present the CRs
of the SSC process radiated from the reverse-shock region for the case of a
thick and thin shell, considering that the reverse shock lies in the adiabatic
regime and evolves in an environment with a homogeneous and stratified medium.
We analyze these CRs with the spectral and temporal characteristics of the
bursts described in the second \textit{Fermi}-LAT GRB catalog (2FLGC) and found
that i) the thin shell case is preferred over a thick shell and a
constant-density medium over a stellar-wind environment, ii) bursts with an
atypical and hard spectral index could be successfully described by this
scenario in different cooling conditions, iii) the early optical flash and GeV
emission exhibited in GRB 160625B and 180720B were generated from the same
accelerated region and electron population, concluding that LAT emission
originated during the early afterglow, and iv) the maximum synchrotron energy
radiated from the reverse-shock scenario could explain only a few photons with
the exception of a pair of bursts, so that scattered photons by the SSC process
must be required.</p></br></body>
