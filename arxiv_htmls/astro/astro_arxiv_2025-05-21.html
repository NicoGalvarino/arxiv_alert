  system along the line-of-sight to a background galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fuga Komori, Akio K. Inoue, Ken Mawatari, Yuma Sugahara, Hideki Umehata, Rhythm Shimakawa, Satoshi Yamanaka, Takuya Hashimoto, Jorryt Matthee, Toru Misawa</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The H~{\sc i} gas distribution in damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) has
remained elusive due to the point-source nature of background quasar emission.
Observing DLAs against spatially extended background galaxies provides a new
method for constraining their size and structure. Using the Keck Cosmic Web
Imager, we present the first ``silhouette'' image of a DLA at $z=3.34$,
identified in the spectrum of a background galaxy at $z=3.61$. Although the
silhouette remains unresolved due to limited spatial resolution, this
represents a successful proof-of-concept for studying DLA morphology using
extended background sources. Possible residual emission in the DLA trough
suggests an optical depth contrast exceeding $10^7$ in the internal structure,
implying a sharp edge or patchy structure. A Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at
$z_{\rm LAE}=3.3433\pm0.0005$, consistent with the DLA redshift, is detected at
an angular separation of $1.''73\pm0.''28$ ($12.9\pm2.1$ kpc). The DLA is
surrounded by three galaxies within 140 kpc in projected distance and 500 km
s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity, indicating that it resides in the
circumgalactic medium of the LAE or within a galaxy group/protocluster
environment. An O~{\sc i} $\lambda1302$ absorption at $z_{\rm
OI}=3.3288\pm0.0004$ is also detected along the line of sight. This absorber
may trace metal-enriched outflow from the LAE or a gas-rich galaxy exhibiting
the highest star formation activity among the surrounding galaxies. Future
large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies will expand such a DLA sample, and
three-dimensional spectroscopy for it will shed new light on the role of
intergalactic dense gas in galaxy formation and evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11919v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Cosmic Evolution and Spatial Distribution of Multiphase Gas

lines (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, C\,\textsc{iv}, Fe\,\textsc{ii}, Mg\,\textsc{ii},
etc.) in the stacked spectra of background sources, using the early data
release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Our analysis reveals
that the equivalent width (\( W \)) of metal absorption lines decreases with
increasing redshift, following an overall trend described by $W \propto
(1+z)^{-4.0\pm 2.2}$. This indicates cosmic enrichment of the gas associated
with QSOs, with a more pronounced enrichment observed at larger scales (a few
Mpc), reflecting a rapid metal enrichment of cosmic web. Additionally, the \( W
\) of these absorption lines decreases with distance ($D$) from QSOs, which can
be effectively characterized by a two-halo model. Compared to the projected two
point correlation function of galaxies at similar redshifts, low-ionization
ions exhibit similar clustering scales, while high-ionization ions show a
significantly more extended spatial distribution. We also find that
$W_{\text{FeII}}/W_{\text{MgII}}$ increases towards lower redshifts and larger
scales, which can be attributed to evolving star formation histories and/or
changes in initial mass function for galaxies. By leveraging multiple
absorption tracers, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of
diffuse, multiphase gas from the circumgalactic medium to cosmological scales,
offering new insights into baryon cycles and the transport of metals throughout
cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13593v1" target="_blank"><h2>The High-redshift Blazar MG3 J163554+3629: Physical Properties and the
  Enigma of Its Unexpected Supermassive Black Hole Growth</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jose Maria Sanchez Zaballa, Eugenio Bottacini, Andrea Tramacere</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> There is general consensus that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) derive their
radiating power from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that accretes matter.
Yet, their precise powering mechanisms and the resulting growth of the SMBH are
poorly understood, especially for AGNs at high redshift. Blazars are AGNs
pointing their jet toward the observer, thus being detectable from radio
through gamma rays at high redshift due to Doppler boosting. The blazar MG3
J163554+3629 is located at redshift z=3.65 and it is a flat spectrum radio
quasar (FSRQ). In this work, we show the results of the modeling of its
spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to gamma rays with a one-zone
leptonic model. We estimate the uncertainties through a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo approach. As a result, we infer the black hole mass M_BH = 1.1(+0.2,-0.1)
x 10^9 Msun and a modest magnetic field of B = 6.56(+0.13,-0.09) x 10^-2 G in
line with the Compton dominance observed in high-redshift FSRQs. The emitting
region is outside the broad line region but within the region of the dust torus
radius. The rather small accretion efficiency of eta=0.083 is not solely
inferred through the SED modeling but also through the energetics. An evolution
study suggests that in an Eddington-limited accretion process the SMBH did not
have time enough to grow from an initial seed mass of ~10^6 Msun at z~30 into a
mass of M_BH ~ 10^9 Msun at z=3.65. Faster mass growth might be obtained in a
super-Eddington process throughout frequent episodes. Alternative scenarios
propose that the existence of the jet itself can facilitate a more rapid
growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11263v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Cosmic Miracle: A Remarkably Luminous Galaxy at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44$

Comments greatly appreciated and warmly welcomed!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly
early epochs, $z>10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the
most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous
($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS legacy field at
$z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier
to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with
NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and
$\approx3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density
of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\approx14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or
Miracle" survey spanning $\approx350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $>100\times$ larger
($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV
lines (${\approx}15{-}35$ \AA) signal a rising star-formation history, with a
${\approx}10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr
($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is
extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet
resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV
slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a
young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate
that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift
where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\approx100\%$ neutral
fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$>1$ hint at an
abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted
luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among
the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the
formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across
the entire sweep of cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12867v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift
  Quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ruancun Li, Luis C. Ho, Chang-Hao Chen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 38 pages, 20 figures, submitted to ApJ. Comments greatly appreciated and warmly welcomed!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises
critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular
resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31
quasars at $4\lesssim z\lesssim7$ drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new
multi-band forward-modeling code (\textsc{GalfitS}) that incorporates
physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission
in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy
distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are $\sim 0.3$~dex
more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking
dichotomy emerges: luminous ``blue'' quasars ($L_{5100}\gtrsim10^{45}\,{\rm
erg\,s^{-1}}$) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies ($n \approx 5$) and exhibit a
narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median $\beta_{\rm UV} \approx
-1.4$), while fainter ``red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts ($n\approx 1$)
and display a broad range of slopes ($\beta_{\rm UV}\approx-2$ to 4). These two
populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with
high-luminosity quasars showing $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\ast = 1.2\%$ compared to
$4.7\%$ for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively $\sim$0.6~dex
above the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\ast$ relation. This offset likely reflects
rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the
active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion.
Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic
spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution
of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13597v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining cosmic ray transport models using circumgalactic medium

Comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic rays (CRs) are a pivotal non-thermal component of galaxy formation and
evolution. However, the intricacies of CR physics, particularly how they
propagate in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), remain largely unconstrained. In
this work, we study CGM properties in FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic
Environments) simulations of the same Milky Way (MW)-mass halo at $z=0$ with
different CR transport models that produce similar diffuse $\sim$ GeV
$\gamma$-ray emission. We study the gas morphology and thermal properties, and
generate synthetic observations of rest-frame UV ion absorption columns and
X-ray emission. CRs lower galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFRs) while
supporting more cool CGM gas, which boosts the HI and OVI column densities in
the CGM, bringing simulations more in line with observations, but there can be
large differences between CR transport models and resolution levels. X-ray
emission within and close to galaxies is consistent with thermal (free-free and
metal-line) emission plus X-ray binaries, while more extended ($\sim 100\,$kpc)
CGM emission is potentially dominated by inverse Compton (IC) scattering,
motivating future work on the spatially resolved X-ray profiles. Although
comparisons with observations are sensitive to sample selection and mimicking
the details of observations, and our analysis did not result in strong
constraints on CR models, the differences between simulations are significant
and could be used as a framework for future studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11734v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust Evolution in Simulated Multi-phase Galactic Outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Helena M. Richie, Evan E. Schneider</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the first large-scale, high-resolution simulations of dusty, star
formation feedback-driven galactic outflows. Using the Cholla hydrodynamics
code, we investigate dust sputtering in these environments for grains ranging
in size from $1-0.001~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$. We compare results for two feedback
models: one representative of low-redshift nuclear starburst galaxies and one
similar to high-redshift main sequence galaxies. In general, our simulations
show that multi-phase outflows are capable of safely transporting a vast
majority of their dust to large distances ($\sim10~\textrm{kpc}$) from the
disk. This work also shows that environmental shielding in cool gas clouds
boosts dust survival rates significantly. The evolutionary path of dust depends
strongly on grain size. Large grains ($a\geq0.1~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$) can be
transported efficiently in all phases. Smaller grains, however, experience
significant destruction in the hotter phases. $0.001~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$ grains in
particular are quickly sputtered in all but the coolest gas, resulting in these
grains strongly tracing the cool phase in outflows. These results may also
indicate the importance of in-situ formation mechanisms, such as shattering,
for the small dust grains and PAHs observed in emission throughout outflows in
nearby galaxies. Surprisingly, we find that the hot phase dominates the
transport of dust that survives to populate the CGM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14025v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quasar identifications from the slitless spectra: a test from 3D-HST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuxuan Pang, Xue-Bing Wu, Yuming Fu, Rui Zhu, Tao Ji, Qinchun Ma, Xiaotong Feng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 15 figures, accepted by MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Slitless spectroscopy is a traditional method for selecting quasars. In this
paper, we develop a procedure for selecting quasars (QSOs) using the 3D-HST
G141 slitless spectra. We initially identify over 6,000 sources with emission
lines broader than those typically found in emission line galaxies (ELGs) by
analyzing the 1D spectra. These ``broad'' emission lines may originate from
actual QSO broad lines ($\rm FWHM\geq1200~\rm km/s$) or the convolved narrow
lines ($\rm FWHM = 200\sim 300\rm km/s$) in ELGs with effective radii
$\geq$0.3" (2.5Kpc at z=1). We then propose a criterion based on the
reliability of the QSO component in the forward modeling results. Using the
known QSOs, ELGs, and simulation spectra, we find that our criterion
successfully selects about 90\% of known QSOs with H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ line
detection and point-like structures, with an ELG contamination rate of about
5\%. We apply this method to emission line sources without significant
contamination and select 19 QSO candidates at redshift $z=0.12-1.56$. 12 of
these candidates have Chandra X-ray detections. This sample covers a broader
range of the rest-frame UV colors and has redder optical slopes compared to the
SDSS QSOs, yet it is more likely to be composed of normal QSOs rather than
little red dots. Through spectral analysis, the estimated black hole masses of
the sample are $10^{6.9}-10^{8.3} M_{\odot}$. Our new candidates improve the
completeness of the QSO sample at $z=0.8-1.6$ in the 3D-HST field. The proposed
method will also be helpful for QSO selections via slitless spectroscopy in
Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10701v1" target="_blank"><h2>Origins of Carbon Dust in a JWST-Observed Primeval Galaxy at $z\sim$6.7</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ambra Nanni, Michael Romano, Darko Donevski, Joris Witstok, Irene Shivaei, Michel Fioc, Prasad Sawant</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> JADES-GS-z6-0, a high-redshift galaxy ($z \sim 6.7$) recently observed as
part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic
Survey (JADES), exhibits a distinct bump in its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)
spectrum indicative of a large quantity of hydrocarbon grains, a sign of rapid
metal and dust enrichment in its interstellar medium (ISM). This galaxy serves
as an ideal case for examining rapid dust formation processes in the early
universe.
  We investigated diverse dust production channels from a possible maximal
formation redshift of $z_{\rm form} \approx 17$, enabling dust contributions
from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars over the longest possible timescale.
Our model simultaneously reproduces key spectral features of JADES-GS-z6-0 such
as its Balmer decrement, UV slope, and UV bump. The match is obtained by
adopting a star-formation history in which a burst at $\sim 600$~Myr accounts
for approximately 30\% of the galaxy's final stellar mass.
  Our findings indicate two pathways for the formation of hydrocarbon grains,
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): (1) efficient dust accretion
within the ISM, necessitating a low depletion of metals into dust grains from
Type II supernovae ($\approx 10$\%), or (2) dust production predominantly by
Type II supernovae, requiring a high depletion fraction ($\approx 73$\%)
without dust accretion. We further demonstrate that PAHs are unlikely to
originate solely from AGB stars or from shattering of large grains in the ISM.
The evolution of the UV slope with redshift points to a complex and bursty star
formation history for galaxies observed by JADES.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13677v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling Electron Density Profile in Nearby Galaxies using SDSS MaNGA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shivam Burman, Sunil Malik, Suprit Singh, Yogesh Wadadekar</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Most observational studies of galactic-scale magnetic fields using Faraday
rotation rely on estimates of thermal electron densities in galaxies and their
radial variations. However, the spatial distribution of electrons in the
interstellar medium (ISM) is not clearly known. In this study, we propose and
utilize collision-excited doublet emission line ratios of [S\,\textsc{ii}]
$\lambda\lambda$ 6716, 6731 \AA~and [O\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726,
3729 \AA \ to estimate the electron densities ($n_e$). To map their
distribution in the galaxies, we employ Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic
observations from the SDSS Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory
(MaNGA) survey, utilising data products from both the \texttt{Pipe3D} and MaNGA
Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We present a spatially resolved analysis of $13$
face-on galaxies (inclination, $i \leq 10^\circ$), including $9$ star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) and $4$ Non-SFGs. Azimuthally averaged radial profiles of $n_e$
are obtained using two different binning schemes: linear and non-linear. For
the \texttt{Pipe3D} case, both SFGs and non-SFGs exhibit $n_e$ gradients, with
higher densities of $n_e$(S\,\textsc{ii}) = $165.6 \pm 20.8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the
inner disk region (r/R$_e$ $\leq$ 1.5), which decrease to $31 \pm 4.5$
cm$^{-3}$ in the outer disk region (r/R$_e$ $>$ 1.5). We also translate $n_e$
to the electron column density $N_e$ assuming an evenly distributed thin disk
profile, fairly excluding the central bulge regions. These electron density
estimates at different radii provide valuable insights for resolving
ambiguities in current and future studies of magnetic fields in galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13056v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modelling the evolution and influence of dust in cosmological

physics and observation of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, explicit
modelling of this ISM constituent remains uncommon in large cosmological
simulations. In this work, we present a model for the life-cycle of dust in the
ISM that couples to the forthcoming COLIBRE galaxy formation model, which
explicitly simulates the cold ISM. We follow 6 distinct grain types: 3 chemical
species, including carbon and two silicate grains, with 2 size bins each. Our
dust model accounts for seeding of grains from stellar ejecta, self-consistent
element-by-element metal yields and depletion, grain size transfer and
destruction of dust in the ISM. We detail the calibration of this model,
particularly the use of a clumping factor, to account for unresolved gas clouds
in which dust readily evolves. We present a fiducial run in a 25$^3$~cMpc$^3$
cosmological volume that displays good agreement with observations of the
cosmic evolution of dust density, as well as the $z=0$ galaxy dust mass
function and dust scaling relations. We highlight known tensions between
observational datasets of the dust-to-gas ratio as a function of metallicity
depending on which metallicity calibrator is used; our model favours
higher-normalisation metallicity calibrators, which agree with the observations
within 0.1~dex for stellar masses $>10^9 \; {\rm M_\odot}$. We compare the
grain size distribution to observations of local galaxies, and find that our
simulation suggests a higher concentration of small grains, associated with
more diffuse ISM and the warm-neutral medium (WNM), which both play a key role
in boosting H$_2$ content. Putting these results and modelling approaches in
context, we set the stage for upcoming insights into the dusty ISM of galaxies
using the COLIBRE simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11072v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Giant Arc -- Filament of Figment?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Till Sawala, Meri Teeriaho</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, 2 figures.

the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We
previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its
discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions,

that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational

which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove
these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are
indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13595v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revealing the intricacies of radio galaxies and filaments in the merging

filaments surrounding radio galaxies, especially in galaxy cluster
environments. The morphology and spectral characteristics of these thin
structures require the combination of high-resolution and low frequency
observations, which is best obtained using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR)
international stations. In this paper, we aim to detect and characterize
non-thermal filaments observed close or as part of the radio galaxies in Abell
2255 using deep, LOFAR-VLBI observations at 144 MHz. These structures can be
used to disentangle possible scenarios for the origin of the non-thermal
filaments and connection to the motion of the host galaxy within the dense and
turbulent intracluster medium (ICM), and consequent interaction between the ICM
and radio jets. Combining multiple observations, we produced the deepest images
ever obtained with LOFAR-VLBI targeting a galaxy cluster, using 56 hours of
observations, reaching $0.3-0.5"$ resolution. We detailed throughout the paper
the calibration and imaging strategy for the different targets, as well as the
multitude of morphological features discovered. Thanks to the high-sensitivity
of LOFAR-VLBI, we revealed unprecedented details for the main cluster radio
galaxies, recovering in most cases also their more extended structure observed
only at such low frequencies. In particular, we focused on the Original Tailed
Radio Galaxy (Original TRG) where we distinguished many filaments constituting
its tail with varying lengths ($80-110$ kpc) and widths ($3-10$ kpc). The final
radio images showcase the potential of deep, high-resolution observations for
galaxy clusters. With such approach, we enabled the study of these thin,
elongated radio filaments: after being discovered, these filaments now require
spectral studies to determine their formation mechanisms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14258v1" target="_blank"><h2>3D matter power spectrum correspondence to 1D Lyman-alpha flux power

about the nature of dark matter and other fundamental physics. A prominent
probe of such scales outside galaxies is the Lyman-alpha forest, which studies
absorption features in the spectra of high-redshift quasars caused by neutral
hydrogen. The measured quantity is the power spectrum of the absorbed flux,
which indirectly traces the underlying matter distribution. However, the
connection between the measured flux power spectrum and the underlying 3D dark
matter power spectrum is highly nontrivial. The flux power spectrum (i)
represents a one-dimensional projection of the density field; (ii) traces only
neutral hydrogen, subject to thermodynamic pressure; and (iii) is a nonlinear
function of local matter density. Additionally, thermal broadening and
redshift-space distortions-determined not only by the hydrogen distribution but
also by its thermal state and local velocity field-further complicate
interpretation. To robustly constrain dark matter properties using the
Lyman-alpha forest, these systematics must be carefully modeled and controlled.
In this paper, we present a simple phenomenological recipe for mapping the 3D
matter power spectrum to the flux power spectrum. We first motivate our
approach in the linear regime, then extend it to later times and into the
nonlinear regime. We validate our model against a broad suite of warm and cold
dark matter simulations, demonstrating that our recipe yields consistent and
accurate estimates across a wide parameter space.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12591v1" target="_blank"><h2>First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XIX:

expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers
occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of
SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this
work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a
suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers
at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers
in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{seed} \approx 1.5
\times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9} M_{\odot}$,
resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim
1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the
comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{merger} =
10^{-3.80} (1 + \delta)^{4.56}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with
higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift
range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{tot} /
M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a
detection rate of 0.030 $yr^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio $SNR
\geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high
redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for
improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's
scientific return.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11616v1" target="_blank"><h2>Carbon-rich dust injected into the interstellar medium by Galactic WC

White</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from
dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion
star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind
speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms
around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as
well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds.
Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed at least 17 concentric
dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four
additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in
2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, surviving for at
least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration
measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features
confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to
binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust,
finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion
comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we
observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps
shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These
results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted
for in galactic dust budgets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11606v1" target="_blank"><h2>The evolution of the halo occupation distribution in cosmic voids</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ignacio G. Alfaro, Facundo Rodriguez, Andrés N. Ruiz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The halo occupation distribution is a cornerstone in understanding galaxy
formation within the large-scale structure.On the other hand, in the context of
the large-scale structure of the Universe, voids are regions with singular
characteristics, given their extension, the low number of objects that inhabit
their interior and their own dynamics. Furthermore, the HOD of these regions
exhibits significant deviations from the average, as shown by several studies
in semi-analytical models, hydrodynamic simulations, and observations. This
paper investigates the temporal evolution of the HOD in cosmic voids from
redshift z = 0.5 to the present day. We aim to understand how the void
environment shapes galaxy occupation over time and to identify the factors
driving the unique HOD observed in these underdense regions. We use the
MDPL2-SAG semi-analytic galaxy catalog and identify spherical cosmic voids at
different redshifts. We analyze the HOD within voids across ten simulation
snapshots, comparing it with the global HOD. Furthermore, we trace the
evolution of z = 0 void galaxies and their host halos back in time, examining
their formation times and local density evolution. Our results reveal that the
HOD within voids is consistently lower than the average HOD at all redshifts
considered. Tracking z = 0 void galaxies, we find that their HOD remains lower
than average throughout the redshift range, with no significant redshift
evolution in this relative difference. Analysis of halo formation histories
shows that lower-mass void halos are younger, while massive void halos are
older compared to the average. Spatially, lower-mass halos are found in the
inner void regions, whereas massive halos are located closer to void
boundaries. The local density of massive void halos decreases significantly
towards z = 0, contrasting with the relatively stable local density of
lower-mass void halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12505v1" target="_blank"><h2>Connecting JWST discovered N/O-enhanced galaxies to globular clusters:
  Evidence from chemical imprints</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xihan Ji, Vasily Belokurov, Roberto Maiolino, Stephanie Monty, Yuki Isobe, Andrey Kravtsov, William McClymont, Hannah Übler</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent JWST observations have revealed a growing population of galaxies at
$z>4$ with elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. These "N/O-enhanced" galaxies
(NOEGs) exhibit near- to super-solar N/O at sub-solar O/H, clearly deviating
from the well-established scaling relation between N/O and O/H observed in
local galaxies. The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly,
local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose
origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance
patterns of 22 known NOEGs at $0\lesssim z\lesssim 12$ -- primarily discovered
with JWST -- to those observed in local globular clusters. We find striking
similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two
populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which
globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments -- similar to
those traced by NOEGs -- that were self-enriched. Indeed, the enhancement in
N/O in early galaxies appears to be only found in dense stellar environments
with $\Sigma _{\star}\gtrsim 10^{2.5}~M_\odot~{\rm pc^{-2}}$, as expected for
the progenitors of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and similar to those of
star clusters identified in strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies.
Furthermore, we find a tentative positive correlation between N/O ratios and
stellar mass among NOEGs. The apparent high occurrence rate of NOEGs at high
redshift is consistent with the picture of cluster-dominated star formation
during the early stages of galaxy evolution. Measuring chemical abundances
across diverse stellar environments in high-redshift galaxies will be crucial
for elucidating the connection between NOEGs and globular clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10821v1" target="_blank"><h2>The link between galaxy structure properties and star formation in local
  galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhimin Zhou, Wenwen Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables, Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> To investigate the role of morphology in galaxy evolution, we analyze the
relationships between galaxy structure, star formation, and HI gas content.
Using multi-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, we perform
detailed structural decompositions on a representative local galaxy sample from
xGASS. Structural components and color properties are examined as functions of
deviations from the star formation main sequence ($\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$) and HI
gas deficiency ($\rm \Delta f_{HI}$). We find that bulge fractions decrease
with higher $\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$ and lower stellar mass, indicating that
star-forming galaxies are predominantly disc-dominated, while quiescent
galaxies are bulge-dominated. The slope of the color ($g-r$) versus $\rm \Delta
SFR_{MS}$ relationship decreases from low to high stellar masses and from outer
to inner regions, with greater color variation in massive galaxies. Color
gradients are predominantly negative, becoming shallower in lower-mass galaxies
and in the outer disk regions. We also identify inflection points in the color
gradient and bulge fraction relations with $\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$, with
main-sequence galaxies having the lowest bulge fractions and steepest color
gradients. At fixed stellar mass, we observe only a slight correlation between
bulge fraction and HI deficiency. However, outer disk colors show a stronger
dependence on HI content than inner regions, and color gradients flatten as
$\rm \Delta f_{HI}$ increases. These results suggest that HI gas is more
closely linked to star-forming, disc-dominated systems, supporting the idea
that gas accretion fuels star formation primarily in galaxy disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11187v1" target="_blank"><h2>PRIMAGAL: a PRIMAger Galactic Plane Far-IR polarization survey to

typical quasars and those with single-peaked velocity-offset broad lines).
whose broad H$\beta$ lines are significantly offset (by ~< a few hundred km/s)

younger stellar bulges from recent interactions than those of control quasars.
After careful subtraction of the central quasar light, our candidate BSBH hosts
show a statistically undifferentiated distribution of host asymmetry,
indicative of a similar fraction of recent mergers. While a significantly
larger sample is needed to place this result on a much firmer statistical
ground, it opens questions as to the timescale differences between galaxy

  Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Harsh Mehta, Suvodip Mukherjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 13 figures, 3 Tables, to be submitted in JCAP</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their
signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP
resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective
mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion
can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial
and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be
measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new
technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment
LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile
of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale
non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial
template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show
that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from
LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $
g_{a\gamma} < 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below
$10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better
than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma}
< 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of
future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space

  /[C II] Ratios from a Sub-parsec Resolution Radiative Transfer Simulation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yurina Nakazato, Kazuyuki Sugimura, Akio K. Inoue, Massimo Ricotti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ, Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both
ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift ($z>6$) galaxies. In this
work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 $\mu$m and
[CII]158 $\mu$m emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of
dwarf-galaxy progenitors at $z=9-13$. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly
radiative transfer at sub-pc ($\sim$ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve
the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking
into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength,
column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII]
predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures
of $\sim (1-5)\times 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ and high ionization parameters of $\log
U_{\mathrm{ion}} \simeq -1.5$. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the
surrounding dense neutral regions at $\sim 5\times 10^3\,\mathrm{K}$, which are
heated by strong FUV radiation from the central stellar clusters. This spatial
arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from
$\sim$ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio
[OIII]/[CII]$\sim5-30$, consistent with recent ALMA detections at $z>6$ without
invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII]
linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas,
$M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ and $n_{\rm HII}/n_{\rm HI}$ and show that the
[OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For
future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived $M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ for
observed $z >6$ galaxies using ${\rm H}\beta$ and [CII] and show the validity
of our scaling relations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13619v1" target="_blank"><h2>SALT spectroscopic follow-up of the G4Jy Sample</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sarah V.

radio sources in the southern sky (Declination < 30 deg), as measured at 151
MHz (S > 4.0 Jy) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), through the GaLactic
and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey. In addition to flux-density
measurements, the G4Jy catalogue provides host-galaxy identifications (through
careful visual-inspection) and four sets of spectral indices. Despite their
brightness in the radio, many of these sources are poorly-studied, with the
vast majority lacking a spectroscopic redshift in published work. This is
crucial for studying the intrinsic properties of the sources, and so we conduct
a multi-semester observing campaign on the Southern African Large Telescope
(SALT), with optical spectroscopy enabling us to provide new redshifts to the
astronomical community. Initial results show that not all of the host galaxies
exhibit emission-line spectra in the optical (~4500-7500 Ang), which
illustrates the importance of radio-frequency selection (rather than optical
selection) for creating an unbiased sample of active galactic nuclei. By
combining SALT redshifts with those from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey
(6dFGS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we calculate radio
luminosities and linear sizes for 299 G4Jy sources (which includes one
newly-discovered giant radio-galaxy, G4Jy 604). Furthermore, with the highest

potentially supplying gas to the disk and triggering star formation. In this
study, we focus on the nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy M83, where high
spatial resolution, high-sensitivity CO (1-0) data are available. We identified
molecular clouds and searched for clouds with velocities deviating by more than
50km/s from the disk velocity field as HVCs. A total of 10 HVCs were detected
-- nine redshifted and one blueshifted -- clearly highlighting an asymmetry in
their velocity distribution. These HVCs have radii of 30-80 pc, masses on the
order of $10^5 M_\odot$, and velocity dispersions of 3-20 km/s, displaying a
tendency toward higher velocity dispersion compared to disk molecular clouds in
M83. Most of the HVCs do not overlap with the candidates of supernova remnants,
and the energy needed to drive HVCs at such high velocities exceeds single
supernova energy. Together with the asymmetry in their velocity distribution,
we thus conclude that most of the HVCs found in this study are inflow from
outside the M83's disk.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12141v1" target="_blank"><h2>The dust emissivity index beta in infrared-bright galaxies at 1.5 < z <

the high end of the range of values that had previously been measured in many

Yamamoto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> During the early stages of star formation, accretion processes such as infall
from the envelope and molecular streamers, and ejection of matter through winds
and jets take place simultaneously. The Class 0/I binary [BHB2007] 11 shows
evidence for accretion and ejection at the scales of the circumbinary disk and
the inner close binary. Recent H$_2$CO observations showed two elongated
structures with hints of outflowing motion almost perpendicular to the main CO
outflow, which is launched from the circumbinary disk. With the aim of
verifying the nature of these elongated structures, we analyze the line
emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ and SiO observed with ALMA within
the Large Program FAUST. These molecules trace material moving at velocities
close to the ambient cloud velocity. The images of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH,
c-C$_3$H$_2$ show the elongated structures, whose gas kinematics are consistent
with outflowing motions and with rotation in the opposite sense to the main CO
outflow. The derived mass loss rate from these large-scale structures is
$(1.8\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}M_{\odot}\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with those
measured in outflows driven by Class 0/I protostars. The SiO image reveals
compact emission close to the binary system, with a slight elongation aligned
with the larger-scale structures. This suggests that SiO is released from the
sputtering of dust grains in the shocked material at the base of the potential
new outflow, with a relative abundance of $\geq(0.11-2.0)\times10^{-9}$.
However, higher angular and spectral resolution observations are needed to
accurately estimate the outflow launching radius and its powering source. Given
the location and the abundance of the SiO emission, we propose that the second
outflow may be launched from inside the circumbinary disk, likely by the less
massive companion, which is actively accreting material from its surroundings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10706v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black holes as dark matter candidates: Multi-frequency
  constraints from cosmic radiation backgrounds</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  C. Casanueva-Villarreal, N. Padilla, P. B. Tissera, B. Liu, V. Bromm</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted in A&A. Acceptance date: 13 May 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Aims. This study investigates the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in
shaping cosmic radiation backgrounds--the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), the
Lyman-Werner background (LWB), and the cosmic radio background (CRB)--and
evaluates their viability as dark matter (DM) candidates based on observational
constraints and theoretical limits. Methods. PBH accretion is modelled using
analytical frameworks that include electron advection-dominated accretion flows
(eADAF), standard advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF), luminous hot
accretion flows (LHAF), and thin disks. Emission from PBHs in both dark matter
halos and the intergalactic medium (IGM) is computed. We assess the impact of
variations in model assumptions, such as halo gas density profiles, gas
velocities, and emission models. The results are compared with observational
limits and theoretical thresholds to constrain the PBH fraction as DM for
masses between 1 and 100 solar masses Results. PBHs may contribute up to 99,
93, 80, and 91 per cent of the unresolved soft X-ray background for masses of
1, 10, 33, and 100 solar masses, respectively, and about 33-39 per cent of the
hard X-ray background. These contributions limit the PBH DM fraction to 7e-3,
6e-4, 6e-4, and 7e-4, respectively, in our baseline model. These constraints
are consistent with those from the LWB, ensuring molecular cooling and early
star formation are preserved. However, explaining the radio background excess
and the EDGES signal would require PBH fractions well above these limits. For 1
solar mass, excluding ADAF subregimes relaxes the constraint to 3e-2,
highlighting the sensitivity to accretion physics. Variations in model
assumptions introduce only minor differences in the predicted backgrounds.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13591v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Galaxy Surveys with Hybrid SBI</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gemma Zhang, Chirag Modi, Oliver H.

D</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys deep into the
non-linear regime. Despite its great promise, its application is limited by the
computational cost of running simulations that can describe the
increasingly-large cosmological datasets. Recent work proposed a hybrid SBI
framework (HySBI), which combines SBI on small-scales with perturbation theory
(PT) on large-scales, allowing information to be extracted from high-resolution
observations without large-volume simulations. In this work, we lay out the
HySBI framework for galaxy clustering, a key step towards its application to
next-generation datasets. We study the choice of priors on the parameters for
modeling galaxies in PT analysis and in simulation-based analyses, as well as
investigate their cosmology dependence. By jointly modeling large- and
small-scale statistics and their associated nuisance parameters, we show that
HySBI can obtain 20\% and 60\% tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$ and

limited due to a scarcity of samples. Recently, Large Sky Area Multi-Object
Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), as the most efficient spectroscopic
telescope, has provided new opportunities for related research. In this study,
based on approximately 70,000 main-sequence early-type stars from the LAMOST
survey, we investigated the IMF of Galactic field stars at the high-mass end
(1.5 < M/Msun < 7.1). First, we derived the slope of the present-day mass
function (PDMF), finding after correcting for selection effect in the observed
sample. We then accounted for the effects of stellar evolution and unresolved
binaries to correct the PDMF back to the IMF, resulting in {\alpha}ini = 2.70 -
2.82. Notably, we corrected both stellar evolution and unresolved binary
effects simultaneously by using binary-Star evolution code, which enhances the
robustness of our results. Additionally, we investigated how different
mass-ratio (q) distributions of binaries and different star formation histories
of the Milky Way impact the IMF. Finally, we tested samples across different
spatial scales and found that {\alpha}ini may exhibit a decreasing trend as the
spatial scale increases, which could be attributed to variations in
metallicity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13301v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gamma Analytical Modeling Evolution (GAME) I: The physical implications

various scientific disciplines and scales to depict growth. It has been
demonstrated that the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) can also be
described broadly by this pattern, i.e. $\frac{dM(T)}{dT} = M_{z,0}\, \times
\frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \, T^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta \, T }$
M$_{\odot}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, where $M_{z,0}$ is the stellar mass at $z$ = 0, $\alpha
= 3.0$, $\beta = 0.5 $ Gyr$^{-1}$ and $T$ describes time. We use the identical
$\Gamma$ growth pattern given by the CSFRD to extend the present day (z = 0)
stellar mass bins $M_{\ast}(T)$ of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) and
investigate if we are able to reproduce observations for the high redshift
GSMFs. Surprisingly, our scheme describes successfully the evolution of the
GSMF over 13.5 Gyrs, especially for objects with intermediate and low masses.
We observe some deviations that manifest {\it solely} at very high redshifts
($z > 1.5$, i.e. more than 9.5 Gyr ago) and {\it specifically} for very small
and exceedingly massive objects. We discuss the possible solutions (e.g.
impacts of mergers) for these offsets. Our formalism suggests that the
evolution of the GSMF is set by simple (few parameters) and physically
motivated arguments. The parameters $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are theoretically
consistent within a multi-scale context and are determined from the dynamical
time scale ($\beta$) and the radial distribution of the accreting matter
($\alpha$). We demonstrate that both our formalism and state-of-the-art
simulations are consistent with recent GSMFs derived from JWST data at high
redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13961v1" target="_blank"><h2>WALLABY pilot survey: Spatially resolved gas scaling relations within

attributed to differences in how HI and stellar properties are measured, with
HI reservoirs typically extending beyond the inner regions of galaxies where
star formation occurs. Using pilot observations from the WALLABY survey, we
present the first measurements of HI mass enclosed within the stellar-dominated
regions of galaxies for a statistical sample of 995 local gas-rich systems,
investigating the factors driving its variation. We examine how global HI
scaling relations change when measurements are restricted to R25 and R24 -- the
isophotal radii at 25 and 24 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the i-band -- and explore how
the fraction of HI mass and HI surface density within these radii correlate
with other galaxy properties. On average, 68% of the total HI mass is enclosed
within R25 and 54% within R24, though significant variation exists between
galaxies. The fraction of HI mass within R25 shows a mild correlation with
stellar properties, with galaxies of higher stellar mass, greater stellar
surface density, or redder colours enclosing a larger fraction of their HI
reservoirs. These correlations do not significantly strengthen when considering
R24. Conversely, global HI surface densities show no significant correlation
with stellar mass or stellar surface density, but trends start emerging when
these are measured within the inner regions of galaxies. The strongest
correlation is observed with optical colour, with bluer galaxies having higher
average HI surface densities within R25. This trend strengthens when we
restrict from R25 to R24, suggesting a closer connection between inner HI
reservoirs and star formation. This study underscores the value of (at least
marginally) resolved HI surveys of statistical samples for advancing our
understanding of the gas-star formation cycle in galaxies.

information from the Balmer decrement (BD) and the dust mass ($M_d$). While
there is no explicit correlation between these two properties, they jointly
probe different aspects of the dust present in galaxies. We explore two new
parameters that link BD with $M_d$ by using star formation rate sensitive
luminosities at several wavelengths (ultraviolet, H$\alpha$, and far-infrared).
This analysis shows that combining the BD and $M_d$ in these ways provides new
metrics that are sensitive to the degree of optically thick dust affecting the
short wavelength emission. We show how these new ''dust geometry'' parameters
vary as a function of galaxy mass, star formation rate, and specific star
formation rate. We demonstrate that they are sensitive probes of the dust
geometry in galaxies, and that they support the ''maximal foreground screen''
model for dust in starburst galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10908v1" target="_blank"><h2>The impact of spiral arms on the star formation life cycle</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andrea Romanelli, Mélanie Chevance, J.

role in regulating galaxy evolution through feedback mechanisms. In turn, the
local and global galactic environments shape the interstellar medium and
provide the initial conditions for star formation, potentially affecting the
properties of this small-scale matter cycle. In particular, spiral arms have
been proposed to play a pivotal role in the star formation life cycle, by
enhancing the gas density and triggering star formation. However, their exact
role is still debated. In this paper, we investigate the role of spiral arms in
the giant molecular cloud evolutionary life cycle and on the star formation
process in a sample of 22 nearby spiral galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We
measure the cloud lifetime, the feedback timescale, the typical distance
between independent regions and the star formation efficiency in spiral arms
and inter-arm regions separately. We find that the distributions of the cloud
lifetime as well as the feedback timescale are similar in both environments.
This result suggests that spiral arms are unlikely to play a dominant role in
triggering star formation. By contrast, the star formation efficiency appears
to be slightly higher in inter-arm regions compared to spiral arms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10721v1" target="_blank"><h2>First JWST/NIRSpec Spectroscopy of O Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Armin Mang Román, Peter Zeidler, Wolf-Rainer Hamann, Lidia M.

understanding massive star evolution and feedback. However, traditional
spectroscopic diagnostics in the UV and optical are not sensitive enough to
characterize weak stellar winds of OB stars in low-metallicity environments. A
new tool to access weak stellar winds is provided by spectroscopy in the
infrared (IR). Stellar atmosphere models indicate that the hydrogen Br$\alpha$
line at $\lambda$\,4.05\,$\mu$m is a useful mass-loss rate indicator,
particularly at low metallicity. The unprecedented capabilities of the NIRSpec
spectrograph on board of the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) allow us
to measure this line in spectra of massive stars in other galaxies. In this
work, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of O-type stars in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which has a metallicity of only 20\% Solar. Our sample
consists of thirteen stars with spectral types ranging from O2 to O9.5
including supergiants, giants, and dwarfs. The stars belong to NGC\,346, the
most massive young cluster in the SMC. We describe the observing strategy and
data reduction, highlighting the treatment of the nebular background emission.
The spectra cover the 2.8--5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, and we detect the
Br$\alpha$ line in emission in each of our sample stars. Using a combination of
spectral and photometric data ranging from the UV to the IR, we improve the
measurements of stellar luminosity and reddening. A first qualitative
comparison of the observed Br$\alpha$ line with stellar atmosphere models shows
its potential as a wind diagnostic for weak-winded stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13167v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially resolved stellar populations and emission lines properties in

tools for understanding the physical properties and evolutionary stages of
galaxies. We aim to characterize the spatially resolved stellar population and
emission line properties of galaxies in the M101 group using Javalambre
Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) data. The datacubes first go through
pre-processing steps, which include masking, noise suppression, PSF
homogenization, and spatial binning. The improved data are then analyzed with
the spectral synthesis code \alstar, which has been previously shown to produce
excellent results with the unique 12 bands filter system of J-PLUS and S-PLUS.
We produce maps of stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$), mean stellar
age and metallicity, star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$),
dust attenuation, and emission line properties such as fluxes and equivalent
widths of the main optical lines. Relations among these properties are
explored. All galaxies exhibit a well-defined age-$\Sigma_\star$ relation,
except for the dwarfs. Similarly, all of the galaxies follow local
$\Sigma_\star$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ star-forming MS relations, with specific star
formation rates that grow for less massive systems. A stellar
$\Sigma_\star$-metallicity relation is clearly present in M101, while other
galaxies have either flatter or undefined relations. Nebular metallicities
correlate with $\Sigma_\star$ for all galaxies. This study demonstrates the
ability of J-PLUS to perform IFS-like analysis of galaxies, offering robust
spatially resolved measurements of stellar populations and emission lines over
large fields of view. The M101 group analysis showcases the potential for
expanding such studies to other groups and clusters, contributing to the
understanding of galaxy evolution across different environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10976v1" target="_blank"><h2>Automated quasar continuum estimation using neural networks: a

increasing the number of observed quasar spectra, requiring the development of
fast and accurate automated methods to estimate spectral continua. Aims. This
study evaluates the performance of three neural networks (NN) - an autoencoder,
a convolutional NN (CNN), and a U-Net - in predicting quasar continua within
the rest-frame wavelength range of $1020~\text{\AA}$ to $2000~\text{\AA}$. The
ability to generalize and predict galaxy continua within the range of
$3500~\text{\AA}$ to $5500~\text{\AA}$ is also tested. Methods. The performance
of these architectures is evaluated using the absolute fractional flux error
(AFFE) on a library of mock quasar spectra for the WEAVE survey, and on real
data from the Early Data Release observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) and the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS).
Results. The autoencoder outperforms the U-Net, achieving a median AFFE of
0.009 for quasars. The best model also effectively recovers the Ly$\alpha$
optical depth evolution in DESI quasar spectra. With minimal optimization, the
same architectures can be generalized to the galaxy case, with the autoencoder
reaching a median AFFE of 0.014 and reproducing the D4000n break in DESI and
VIPERS galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11120v2" target="_blank"><h2>Search for dwarf galaxies in the southwestern sector of the Local cosmic

the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, $\textit{Horizon Run 5}$. To this
end, early-type galaxies are selected from the simulated galaxy catalogs based
on stellar mass and kinematic morphology. The shapes of galaxies and subhalos
are computed using the reduced inertia tensor derived from mass-weighted
particle positions. We find that the misalignment between galaxies and their
corresponding dark-matter subhalos decreases over time. We further analyze the
two-point correlation between galaxy or subhalo shapes and the large-scale
density field traced by their spatial distribution, and quantify the amplitude
using the nonlinear alignment model across a wide redshift range from $z =
0.625$ to $z = 2.5$. We find that the intrinsic alignment amplitude, $A_{\rm

matter subhalos exhibits moderate redshift evolution, with a power-law slope
that deviates from zero at a significance level exceeding $3\sigma$.
Additionally, $A_{\rm NLA}$ is found to depend on both the stellar mass and
kinematic morphology of galaxies. Notably, our results are broadly consistent
with existing observational constraints. Our findings are in good agreement

(SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field
spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a
resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the
photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild
orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the
black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our
axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} =
3.6^{+0.6}_{-0.6} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly
more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account
for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent
a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13%
of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in
NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster,
our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped
remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is
insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival
ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides
some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively
weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with
$M_{DM}/M_{*} < 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The
inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14686v1" target="_blank"><h2>HDO ice detected toward an isolated low-mass protostar with JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Katerina Slavicinska, Łukasz Tychoniec, María Gabriela Navarro, Ewine F. van Dishoeck, John J.

system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains
poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links
between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to
physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1
$\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward L1527 IRS, an isolated low-mass
protostar that may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice
HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported
error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band
strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in
the warm ($>$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and
protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a
similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in
these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice
sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water
ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer
protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times
higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass
protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to
either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and
protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated
dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to
the environment in which our Sun formed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13605v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deep galaxy stellar mass functions as a function of star formation rate

$\alpha=-1.35^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ which is similar to or steeper than typical
field values. Using deep \ha{} data from the Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing
Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) we separate out star-forming galaxies, quiescent
galaxies with no ongoing star formation, and low-SFR galaxies that are
intermediate between these two populations. For each of these populations, the
shape of the SMF is found to be universal throughout the cluster, from the core
to the outskirts. The star-forming and quiescent SMFs show stark differences
with values seen in field galaxies. The relative fraction of quiescent galaxies
is highest in the core of the cluster, with low-SFR and star-forming galaxies
more significant in the outer regions of the cluster. At low stellar masses
($M_*\lesssim10^9~{M}_{\odot}$), the quiescent fraction in the main cluster is
significantly higher than that of the field and even satellites of massive
groups. At high stellar masses, the quiescent fraction is similar to other
studies of cluster galaxies. We model the quiescent population in the infall
region of the cluster as a combination of backsplash and field quiescent
galaxies, and find that the backsplash fractions needed to explain the observed

population of low-mass galaxies that are pre-processed outside the virial

astrobiology, tightly linked to galaxy-scale evolution and cosmological
processes. Using IllustrisTNG, we revisit the proposed local peak in the
mass-metallicity relation for small, metal-rich, star-forming galaxies
(Cloudlet) as an indicator of enhanced galactic habitability. We refine the
earlier analysis by applying updated filtering criteria to identify a more
refined sample, further selecting objects based on their history. This process
resulted in a confirmed sample of 97 dwarf galaxies, alongside 519 additional
structures of uncertain origin, potentially comprising both numerical artefacts
and unrecognised physical systems. Under these stricter conditions, the
proposed bimodality in galactic habitability is strongly diminished. However,
the astrobiological potential of metal-rich dwarfs, most of which are compact
remnants of more massive galaxies that underwent tidal stripping, is a
thrilling area of exploration. Although dense stellar environments are
traditionally seen as inhospitable, recent studies highlight the role of
dynamic environments in enhancing the distribution of biological material.
Furthermore, the potential habitability of tidal structures formed in the
aftermath of galactic interactions is a fascinating possibility. Our findings
suggest that non-traditional structures support conditions favourable for life,
opening up exciting new avenues for astrobiological research. This research
underscores the need for a holistic approach to studying habitability that
moves beyond planetary and stellar-focused frameworks to incorporate the
broader galactic environment. Understanding the interactions between galaxies,
their evolution, and the influence of their surroundings is essential to
developing a more comprehensive model of how and where life might emerge and
persist across the Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10734v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disrupted and surviving satellites of Milky-Way-mass galaxies:

distinct stellar populations that exist over 6 times half-light radius from its
center. The results are obtained by applying a newly developed algorithm to the
deep and wide-field photometric dataset taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the
Subaru Telescope. The algorithm employs the genetic algorithm and the simulated
annealing to minimize a $\chi^{2}$ value between the observed color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) and synthetic CMD generated from the stellar isochrones. The age
and metallicity resolutions are set to $0.5$ Gyr and $0.1$ dex, respectively.
The accuracy assessment with mock galaxies shows that it returns the peaks of
metallicity distributions and star formation period within 1 $\sigma$ of input
value in the case of a single population. In tests with two populations, two
distinct metallicity peaks are identified without an offset from the input
values, indicating the robustness of this algorithm. The detected two
populations in the UMi dSph have the metallicity peaks of [Fe/H] = $-2.2$ and
$-2.5$; the metal-rich population started its star formation about 1 Gyr later
than the metal-poor one. The SFH of both metal-rich and metal-poor populations
varies with distance from the center of the UMi dSph, without any
age-gradients. These results suggest that the UMi dSph underwent a complex
formation process, contrary to the simple formation history of dwarf galaxies
previously thought.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13596v1" target="_blank"><h2>FAUST XXIV. Large dust grains in the protostellar outflow cavity walls

Accepted Letter in Astronomy & Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust
grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations
have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of
young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still
lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows.
We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary
L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational
signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index
($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution
(50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in
the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST
Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO
outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density
$>2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm
mm}$<1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the
typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational
evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest
that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by
protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by
gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for
grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13590v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation and evolution of boxy/peanut bulges in the Auriga cosmological

Grand, Facundo Gómez, Federico Marinacci</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables - Accepted for publication on MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Boxy/peanut (b/p) or X-shaped bulges have been extensively explored with
theory and numerical simulations of isolated galaxies. However, it is only
recently that advances in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations have made it
possible to explore b/p bulges in a cosmological setting, with much remaining
to be understood about their formation and evolution. By using the Auriga
magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, we characterise the
structural parameters of b/p bulges and how they form and evolve throughout
cosmic history. We develop a method for estimating the b/p strength that allows
us to identify the formation time and size of these structures. We find that
b/p bulges in Auriga form between $\sim 1.1-1.6\, \mathrm Gyr$ after bar
formation, following a `buckling' episode; some galaxies undergo multiple
bucklings and events of b/p growth, with some b/p structures `dissolving'
between buckling events. We find that at $z=0$, the b/p bulges have an extent
of almost half the bar length. Finally, we analyse the evolution of the b/p
fraction over redshift, finding that at $z=0$, two thirds of galaxies host a
bar, and of these, $45$ per cent have a b/p. This b/p fraction is within the
observed range at $z=0$, although on the low end as compared to some
observational studies. The b/p fraction decreases to $20$ per cent at $z=0.5$,
and falls to zero at $z \sim 1$; this is in line with the observed trend of
declining b/p fraction with redshift. We discuss possible culprits for the
apparent mismatch in b/p occurrence between observations and cosmological
simulations, what causes them to form (or not) in these simulations, and what
this might reveal about models of galaxy formation and evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14073v1" target="_blank"><h2>Zangetsu: A Candidate of Isolated, Quiescent, and Backsplash
  Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy in the COSMOS Field</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Leyao Wei, Song Huang, Jiaxuan Li, Zechang Sun, Mingyu Li, Jiaxin Tang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Deep imaging surveys have changed our view of the low surface brightness
(LSB) Universe. The "renaissance" of the low surface brightness dwarf galaxy
population, as the prime example of such recent development, continues to
challenge our understanding of galaxy formation. Here, We report the
serendipitous discovery of Zangetsu, an isolated, quiescent, and distorted
ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the COSMOS field, using images from the
Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Zangetsu exhibits an
extremely low central surface brightness ($\mathrm{\mu_{0,g}}=26.60\pm0.01$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$), a very shallow inner surface brightness profile
($\mathrm{n}_{\rm Sersic}=0.40\pm0.01$), and a large angular size
($\mathrm{R_e}\approx 10.44$ arcsec). Surprisingly, Zangetsu also has a
quiescent stellar population ($\mathrm{g-i}=0.96$), an unusually elongated
shape ($\mathrm{b/a}\sim 0.25$), and mild morphological asymmetry, making it a
rare case among known UDGs. Surface brightness fluctuation analysis of HSC and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images only provides a distance lower limit of
$D>25.4$ Mpc (thus $\mathrm{R_e}>1.38$ kpc). However, Zangetsu remains an
extreme outlier in the luminosity-size relation of known LSB galaxies,
suggesting that it could be an exceptionally large and/or diffuse system.
Classic internal or external UDG formation mechanisms alone struggle to explain
such a system. A backsplash origin may account for its isolation and quiescent
nature. This finding also raises the possibility that current works may
overlook similarly extreme, elongated systems that could further our
understanding of the LSB Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14644v1" target="_blank"><h2>Minimizing Contaminant Leakage in Internal Linear Combination Maps Using
  a Data-Driven Approach</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kristen M. Surrao, Shivam Pandey, J. Colin Hill, Eric J. Baxter</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11+9 pages, 7+9 figures, code available inthis https URL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, the inverse-Compton scattering
of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off high-energy electrons, is a
powerful probe of hot, ionized gas in the Universe. It is often measured via
cross-correlations of CMB data with large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to
constrain gas physics and improve cosmological constraints. The largest source
of bias to these measurements is the leakage of poorly understood thermal dust
emission from star-forming galaxies -- the cosmic infrared background (CIB) --
into the tSZ maps. This CIB contamination is difficult to clean via
multifrequency component separation methods, such as internal linear
combination (ILC), due to uncertainty in its spectral energy distribution
(SED), which exhibits spatial and line-of-sight variation and decorrelation.
Thus, improved ILC-based techniques have been developed to null ("deproject")
both the CIB and its first moment with respect to the emissivity index $\beta$
in order to robustly remove the CIB despite the lack of first-principles
knowledge of its SED. While decreasing the bias, such procedures can
significantly increase the noise in the resulting ILC maps. In this paper, we
develop a data-driven algorithm for determining the optimal CIB SED to
deproject when measuring a tSZ-LSS cross-correlation, obviating the need to
deproject the first moment in the ILC map used for such a measurement. Our
method gives an unbiased cross-correlation with increased signal-to-noise. We
demonstrate its efficacy on simulations, finding a 60% improvement in the
signal-to-noise ratio for an example tSZ cross-correlation with a halo sample
at redshifts $0.8 < z < 1.8$, as compared to moment deprojection approaches.
Though used here for CIB removal in tSZ cross-correlations, our method is
broadly applicable to minimizing contaminant leakage in ILC maps. Our code is
available in CIB-deproj.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13713v1" target="_blank"><h2>CHANG-ES: XXXVI. The thin and thick radio discs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  V.

halo, which envelops these galaxies. The radio halos are caused by extra-planar
cosmic-ray electrons that emit synchrotron emission in magnetic fields. Aims.
We aim to study the origin of radio halos around galaxies and infer the role of
cosmic-rays in supporting the gaseous discs. We would like to test the
influence of star formation as the main source of cosmic rays as well as other
fundamental galaxy properties such as mass and size. Methods. We present a
study of radio continuum scale heights in 22 nearby edge-on galaxies from the
CHANG-ES survey. We employ deep observations with the Jansky Very Large Array
in the S-band (2-4 GHz), imaging at 7" angular resolution. We measure scale
heights in three strips within the effective radio continuum radius, correcting
for the influence of angular resolution and inclination angle. We include only
galaxies where a distinction between the two disc components can be made in at
least one of the strips, providing us with robust measurements of both scale
heights. Results. We find a strong positive correlation between scale heights
of the thin and thick discs and star-forming radius as well as star-formation
rate (SFR); moderately strong correlations are found for the mass surface
density and the ratio of SFR-to-mass surface density; no correlation is found
with SFR surface density alone. Yet the SFR surface density plays a role as
well: galaxies with high SFR surface densities have a rather roundish shape,
whereas galaxies with little star formation show only a relatively small
vertical extent in comparison to their size. Conclusions. Thick gaseous discs
are partially supported by cosmic-ray pressure. Our results are a useful
benchmark for simulations of galaxy evolution that include cosmic rays.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13611v1" target="_blank"><h2>INSPIRE: INvestigating Stellar Populations In RElics. IX. KiDS

majority of their stars in the early Universe and lived untouched until today,
completely missing any subsequent size-growth caused by mergers and
interactions. They provide the unique opportunity to put constraints on the
first phase of mass assembly in the Universe with the ease of being nearby.
While only a few relics have been found in the local Universe, the {\tt
INSPIRE} project has confirmed 38 relics at higher redshifts ($z \sim
0.2-0.4$), fully characterising their integrated kinematics and stellar
populations. However, given the very small sizes of these objects and the
limitations imposed by the atmosphere, structural parameters inferred from
ground-based optical imaging are possibly affected by systematic effects that
are difficult to quantify. In this paper, we present the first high-resolution
image obtained with Adaptive Optics Ks-band observations on SOUL-LUCI@LBT of
one of the most extreme {\tt INSPIRE} relics, KiDS~J0842+0059 at $z \sim 0.3$.
We confirm the disky morphology of this galaxy (axis ratio of $0.24$) and its
compact nature (circularized effective radius of $\sim 1$ kpc) by modelling its
2D surface brightness profile with a PSF-convolved S\'ersic model. We
demonstrate that the surface mass density profile of KiDS~J0842+0059 closely
resembles that of the most extreme local relic, NGC~1277, as well as of
high-redshift red nuggets. We unambiguously conclude that this object is a
remnant of a high-redshift compact and massive galaxy, which assembled all of
its mass at $z>2$, and completely missed the merger phase of the galaxy
evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12720v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cluster optical depth and pairwise velocity estimation using machine
  learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yulin Gong, Rachel Bean</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We apply two machine learning methods, a CNN deep-leaning model and a
gradient-boosting decision tree, to estimate individual cluster optical depths
from observed properties derived from multiple complementary datasets. The
models are trained and tested with simulated N-body derived halo catalogs and
synthetic full-sky CMB maps designed to mirror data from the DESI and Simons
Observatory experiments. Specifically, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) and
CMB lensing convergence, along with cluster virial mass estimates are used as
features to train the machine learning models. The predicted optical depths are
combined with kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements to estimate
individual cluster radial peculiar velocities. The method is shown to recover
an unbiased estimate of the pairwise velocity statistics of the simulated
cluster sample. The model's efficacy is demonstrated for halos with mass range
$10^{13} M_{\odot} < M_{200} < 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ over a redshift range
$0<z<1$, and validated in the presence of primary CMB, instrument noise,
lensing convergence noise, and potential uncertainties in halo virial mass
estimates. We apply the method to ACT CMB data, using ACT DR4
component-separated maps for tSZ and CMB lensing and ACT DR5 maps for kSZ, in
conjunction with galaxy clusters observed in the SDSS DR15 spectroscopic
survey. We demonstrate that the machine learning approach is an effective one
to analyze data from current and upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons
Observatory and CCAT, and galaxy surveys, such as DESI and Roman, for which the
pairwise velocity statistics can provide valuable insights into the properties
of neutrinos and gravity on cosmic scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13653v1" target="_blank"><h2>UGC 10043 in Depth: Dissecting the Polar Bulge and Subtle LSB Features</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S.

Mosenkov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies with polar structures -- of which polar-ring galaxies (PRGs) are a
prominent subclass -- contain components that are kinematically decoupled and
highly inclined relative to the host galaxy's major axis. Modern deep optical
surveys provide a powerful means of detecting low surface brightness (LSB)
features around galaxies, offering critical insights into the formation and
evolution of galaxies with polar structures. UGC 10043 is an edge-on galaxy
notable for its prominent bulge, which extends orthogonally to the disk plane.
In addition, the galaxy displays a well-defined integral-shaped disk warp and
multiple dust features crossing the bulge along the minor galaxy axis. In this
work, we present new deep optical photometry of UGC 10043 down to 29.5 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ and perform a detailed analysis of its LSB and polar structures.
The observations reveal a stellar stream aligned along the polar axis,
alongside other signatures of tidal interaction, including a flat, tilted LSB
envelope that extends toward the neighboring galaxy MCG +04-37-035, with which
UGC 10043 is connected by an HI bridge. Our results suggest that the polar
component of UGC 10043 comprises and older, triaxial polar bulge and a younger,
forming polar structure, likely originating from the ongoing disruption of a
dwarf satellite galaxy, while also participating in active interaction with MCG
+04-37-035.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11587v2" target="_blank"><h2>Young stars discovered in dwarf spheroidal galaxies confirm their recent

galactic nucleus (LLAGN), making it vital to understand this mode of black hole
accretion. However, the presence or absence of Seyfert-like geometries - an
accretion disk close to the black hole, an optical broad line region (BLR), and
a molecular torus - remains uncertain owing to the low flux levels of sources
within this class. Herein, we present an analysis of a XRISM/Resolve spectrum
of M81*, the LLAGN in the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy M81. A weak,
neutral Fe K emission line is detected and resolved into K$_{\alpha,1}$ and
K$_{\alpha,2}$ components. It shows a negligible velocity shift, and weak
broadening (FWHM$=460^{+260}_{-160}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) that corresponds to
an inner emission radius of ${\rm r} \geq 2.7\times 10^{4}~GM/c^{2}$ for likely
inclinations. The Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line likely traces a torus. The upper limit
on additional splitting of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line components translates to a
limit on the local magnetic field of ${\rm B} \leq 3.5\times 10^{8}$ Gauss,
assuming Zeeman splitting. The spectra also reveal ionized plasma(s) through
He-like Fe XXV and H-like Fe XXVI emission lines. These can be fit equally well
assuming photoionization and collisional excitation. The H-like Fe XXVI line is
better described when a second component is included with a red-shift of ${\rm
v} = 1600~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, but this addition is of marginal statistical
significance. We discuss these results in the context of radiatively
inefficient accretion flow models, magnetically arrested disks, and possible
links to the Fermi bubbles in the Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10901v1" target="_blank"><h2>Manifold dynamics and orbital properties in a two-dimensional galactic

on the properties of the escape of orbits from the central regions of the

evolutions, like the time an orbit needs to escape from the central region, the
total time it spends at the exterior areas of the galaxy, as well as the number
of its escapes and reentries from and to the central region. Furthermore, we
follow the past and future evolution of orbits keeping track of the regions

Robberto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A, comments welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> To fully understand the star formation process, we are compelled to study it
in a variety of environments. Of particular interest are how star formation and
the resulting initial mass function (IMF) vary as a function of metallicity. We
have observed an embedded young cluster in Sh2-284 (hereafter S284), the HII
region associated with the open cluster Dolidze 25 using JWST/NIRCam with the
aim to study star formation in a metal-poor, i.e., about 1/3 of solar,
environment. In particular, we aim to measure the peak of the IMF. Using JWST
NIRCam photometry, we identified the embedded cluster S284-EC1 and resolved its
low-mass content. By comparison with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks we
determine the mass and extinction for the individual cluster members.
Extinction limited samples are created based on the distribution of extinction
and the completeness of the data. For the region with a completeness of 50% or
higher, we have fitted a log-normal distribution to the IMF. Adopting a
fiducial age of 1 Myr of the members, the peak of the IMF is found to be at mc
= 0.16+-0.02Msun, which is significantly smaller than the peak mass measured in
local young clusters, such as mc = 0.26+0.11-0.07 Msun in the Orion Nebula
Cluster (Gennaro & Robberto 2020), or the local Galactic disk value of mc =
0.25 Msun (Chabrier 2005). We have found evidence for IMF variation as a
function of metallicity, i.e., the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses as
one goes from solar to 1/3 solar metallicity. However, we caution that the
result is sensitive to the assumed age of the stellar population, i.e., with
peak mass rising if an age older than 1 Myr is adopted. This study further
motivates the need for expanded samples of low-metallicity regions and their
content to enable more comprehensive measures of the IMF in such environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13242v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA observation of evolving magnetized corona in the radio-quiet

the mm continuum variability of a CSAGN using archival ALMA band 6 ($\sim 230$
GHz) observations of NGC 1566 obtained in 2014-2023. We find a positive
correlation between the mm and X-ray flux with an intrinsic scatter of 0.05 dex
($1\sigma$), suggesting a common origin. The mm spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm
mm}$) is found in the range of $0.13\pm0.38$ to $-0.26\pm0.53$, consistent with
a compact optically thick synchrotron source. No significant correlation was
found between the $\alpha_{\rm mm}$ and the mm flux. The mm/X-ray ratio also
shows no clear link to the Eddington ratio but is higher in the low-accretion
state. We discuss several scenarios about the origin of the mm emission in NGC
1566. We find that synchrotron emission in the magnetized X-ray corona appears
to be the most probable origin of mm emission, confirming that mm emission can
be used as a tracer of AGN activity in RQAGNs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13756v1" target="_blank"><h2>OGHReS: Star formation in the Outer Galaxy II ($\ell =

paper, we analysed 3584 clumps between $\ell = 250^\circ$ and $280^\circ$.
Here, we cover a further 3122 clumps ($180^\circ < \ell < 250^\circ$) and
determine reliable velocities for \withVLSR\ of these, finding good agreement
with the previously assigned velocities ($\sim$80 percent within 5 \kms). We
update velocities for 288 clumps and provide new values for an additional 411.
Combining these with the previous results, we have velocities and physical
properties for 6193 clumps (92.3 percent). The \allnonDetections\
non-detections are low surface density clumps or likely contamination by
evolved stars and galaxies. Key findings: i) improved correlation between
clumps and spiral arm loci, and the discovery of clumps beyond the outer arm
supports the existence of a new spiral structure; ii) decreasing trend in the
$L/M$-ratio consistent with less high-mass star formation in the outer Galaxy;
iii) increase in the star formation fraction (SFF) in the outer Galaxy,
suggesting that more clumps are forming stars despite their lower mass; iv)
discrepancies in velocity assignments across different surveys that could
affect $\sim$10000 clumps, especially in the fourth quadrant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13290v1" target="_blank"><h2>Type Ia supernova growth-rate measurement with LSST simulations:

supernovae (\sns) will improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy
and enable tests of general relativity. In this paper, we generate simulations
of the 10 year \sn\ dataset of the Rubin-LSST survey, including a correlated
velocity field from a N-body simulation and realistic models of \sns\
properties and their correlations with host-galaxy properties. We find, similar
to SN~Ia analyses that constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameters
$w_0w_a$, that constraints on $\fsig$ can be biased depending on the intrinsic
scatter of \sns. While for the majority of intrinsic scatter models we recover
$\fsig$ with a precision of $\sim13 - 14\%$, for the most realistic dust-based
model, we find that the presence of non-Gaussianities in Hubble diagram
residuals leads to a bias on $\fsig$ of about $\sim-20\%$. When trying to
correct for the dust-based intrinsic scatter, we find that the propagation of
the uncertainty on the model parameters does not significantly increase the
error on $\fsig$. We also find that while the main component of the error
budget of $\fsig$ is the statistical uncertainty ($>75\%$ of the total error
budget), the systematic error budget is dominated by the uncertainty on the
damping parameter, $\sigma_u$, that gives an empirical description of the
effect of redshift space distortions on the velocity power spectrum. Our
results motivate a search for new methods to correct for the non-Gaussian
distribution of the Hubble diagram residuals, as well as an improved modeling
of the damping parameter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13240v1" target="_blank"><h2>Did the Corona Borealis-A2142 supercluster binary-like system originate
  as a proto-cluster binary embedded in a primordial cloud of galaxies?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Baiesi Pillastrini G. Carlo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Research note 6 pag. 1 fig</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The formation of the giant binary-like system composed by the Corona Borealis
and Abell 2142 superclusters is an intriguing conundrum of the formation of
large scale structures since, from the observational point of view, it
represents a rare peculiarity in the distribution of massive galaxy
superclusters. Having a configuration similar to a giant binary system
interconnected by a huge filament, it is likely one if not the unique case to
date observed in the Local Universe. So a question arise: how and when did it
form? Here, the CrB and A2142 system has been hypothesized to be a descendent
of a primordial binary system composed of two close galaxy proto-clusters, the
CrB and A2142, originated from two independent collapsing process within a
dense cloud of galaxies. Then, assuming that at a certain point the decoupling
occurred due to the interplay of gravity-antigravity of DE, they began to move
away in radial motion from each other following the accelerate expansion of the
Universe. In the context of the LCDM model a Newtonian approximation of the two
body motion in presence of DE has been applied using current physical
parameters of the CrB and A2142 system with the aim to calculate the look-back
time at decoupling. Its compatibility with the era of formation of the
primordial galaxy proto-clusters has been tested. The event of the binary
decoupling happened in a time larger than the age of the Universe! Of course,
after such a result the advanced hypothesis on the origins of the CrB-A2142
system can be rejected, but not the test of compatibility since the look-back
time at the error lower limit is 12.5 Gys ( z = 4.5) largely consistent with
observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13267v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio continuum spectra of SFGs in the XMM-LSS Field below-threshold</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  E.

\textit{K}$_{S}$-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the XMM-LSS field
using extensive multiwavelength data. By employing various diagnostics, SFGs
are distinguished from quiescent galaxies and AGN across seven redshift bins
($\rm{0.1\leq\,\textit{z}\,\leq\,3.0}$). The broadband radio frequency spectral
energy distribution is analysed at observer-frame frequencies from 144 to 1500
MHz using median stacking techniques correcting for median flux boosting. We
investigate the relationship between the radio spectral index, $\alpha$ (where
$S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) and redshift ($z$). Our analysis reveals no significant
inverse correlation between $\alpha$ and $z$, indicating that the radio
spectrum remains independent with varying redshift. We fit the stacked median
radio SEDs with a power law (\textit{PL}), curved power law (\textit{CPL}) and
double power law (\textit{DPL}) models. For the \textit{DPL} and \textit{CPL}
models, we observe a consistent steepening of the low-frequency spectral index
across all redshift bins. For the \textit{CPL} model, the curvature term $q$ is
greater than zero in all redshift bins. Model comparisons indicate that spectra
are generally well fitted by all the models considered. At 1500 MHz, SFGs
display both a steep synchrotron component and a flat free-free emission
component, with a thermal fraction consistently around 11$\%$ to 18$\%$.
Further deep radio observations, with higher resolution to better deal with
source blending and confusion noise and wider frequency coverage to better
separate non-thermal and thermal radio emission, are required to reveal the
detailed physical processes, thus clarifying the nature of radio sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11364v1" target="_blank"><h2>APE: An analytical protostellar environment to provide physical

interpret observations, both requiring a knowledge of the physical conditions.
In this paper, we present the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code,
which aims at making chemical simulations and synthetic observations
accessible. APE contains a physical model of protostellar evolution (including
the central object, the envelope, the protoplanetary disk and the outflow) as
well as interfaces to publicly available codes to perform chemical simulations,
radiative transfer calculations, and synthetic interferometry imaging. APE
produces density and temperature maps of protostellar systems. The code can
also follow individual particles throughout their journey in a collapsing core.
APE includes a treatment of the dust grain size-distribution to compute
opacities self-consistently for subsequent radiative transfer. We show an
example of application of APE by computing chemical abundance maps of CO, CN,
CS, H2CO, and CH3OH in a Class I protostellar system. We also performed
synthetic ALMA observations of their molecular emission assuming an edge-on
source inclination. The moment 0 maps of CO, CS, and H2CO display an X-shaped
emission similar to what is observed toward the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11453v1" target="_blank"><h2>EMU/GAMA: A new approach to characterising radio luminosity functions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

AGN using statistical redshift estimation in the absence of comprehensive
spectroscopic data. Sensitive radio surveys over large areas detect many
sources with faint optical and infrared counterparts, for which redshifts and
spectra are unavailable. This challenges our attempt to understand the
population of radio sources. Statistical tools are often used to model
parameters (such as redshift) as an alternative to observational data. Using
the data from GAMA G23 and EMU early science observations, we explore simple
statistical techniques to estimate the redshifts in order to measure the RLFs
of the G23 radio sources as a whole and for SFGs and AGN separately. Redshifts
and AGN/SFG classifications are assigned statistically for those radio sources
without spectroscopic data. The calculated RLFs are compared with existing
studies, and the results suggest that the RLFs match remarkably well for low
redshift galaxies with an optical counterpart. We use a more realistic high
redshift distribution to model the redshifts of (most likely) high redshift
radio sources and find that the LFs from our approach match well with measured
LFs. We also look at strategies to compare the RLFs of radio sources without an
optical counterpart to existing studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12110v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Properties and Velocity Dispersion-Mass Relation of $z \sim 1$

and cluster masses $\mathrm{M}_{200} \gtrsim 2\times 10^{14}$ \hm. Using the
highly effective GalWeight technique for cluster membership assignment
developed by our own team, we derive the dynamical parameters of these clusters
through the virial mass estimator. We examine the velocity dispersion-cluster
mass relation $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ for the GG cluster sample. We find,
$\log{\sigma_{200}} = (2.94\pm0.02) + (0.37\pm0.07)\log{\mathrm{M}_{200}}$ with
an intrinsic scatter of $(\sigma_\mathrm{int} = 0.02 \pm 0.02)$. Our results
demonstrate that the $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ relation is consistent with
predictions from cosmological simulations, highlighting the reliability of the
GalWeight technique for cluster membership assignment. Furthermore, the
$(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ validates the robustness of the virial mass estimator in
accurately recovering cluster masses and associated parameters. Importantly,
our findings confirm that velocity dispersion can be used directly to estimate
cluster mass without relying on dynamical mass estimators.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13962v1" target="_blank"><h2>XXII. Accurate stellar velocity dispersions of the SL2S lens sample and

Shajib, Michele Cappellari, Carlo Nipoti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We reanalyze spectra taken as part of the SL2S lens galaxy survey, with the
goal to obtain stellar velocity dispersion with precision and accuracy
sufficient for time-delay cosmography. In order to achieve this goal, we impose
stringent cuts on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and employ recently developed
methods to mitigate and quantify residual systematic errors due to template
libraries and fitting process. We also quantify the covariance across the
sample. For galaxies with spectra with SNR > 20/{\AA}, our new measurements
have average random uncertainty of 3-4%, average systematic uncertainty of 2%,
and covariance across the sample of 1%. We find negligible covariance between
spectra taken with different instruments. The systematic uncertainty and
covariance need to be included when the sample is used as an external dataset
in time-delay cosmography. We revisit empirical scaling relations of lens
galaxies based on the improved kinematics. We show that the SLS2 sample, the
TDCOSMO time-delay lens sample, and the lower redshift SLACS sample follow the
same correlation between effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion and
lensing mass, known as the lensing mass fundamental plane, as that derived by
Auger et al. (2010) assuming isothermal mass profiles for the deflectors. We
also derive for the first time the lensing mass fundamental plane assuming free
power-law mass density profiles, and show that the three samples also follow
the same correlation. This is consistent with a scenario in which massive
galaxies evolve by growing their radii and mass, but staying within the plane.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14378v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards mapping turbulence in the intracluster medium IV. Using
  NewAthena/X-IFU and simulation based inference to constrain turbulence</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alexeï Molin, Simon Dupourqué, Nicolas Clerc, Étienne Pointecouteau, François Pajot, Edoardo Cucchetti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context. The NewAthena mission planned for launch in the mid-2030s will carry
X-IFU, an integral field unit spectrometer that will enable unique insight in
the X-ray hot universe through its combination of spectral and spatial
capabilities. The high spectral resolution will allow a mapping of turbulent
velocities of the hot gas in galaxy clusters, providing an unrivaled way to
study the complex dynamics within galaxy clusters.
  Aims. This is the fourth in a series of papers aimed at forecasting the
ability to investigate turbulence in the intracluster medium through the
observation of the centroid shift caused by turbulent motions of the gas. In
this paper we improve on previous methods by investigating the ability of
simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the underlying nature of velocity
fluctuations through the use of standard observational diagnostics, such as the
structure function.
  Methods. We rely on a complex architecture of neural networks in order to
model the likelihood and posterior distributions relevant to our case. We
investigate its capability to retrieve the turbulence parameters on mock
observations, and explore its capability to use alternative summary statistics.
  Conclusions. Our trained models are able to infer the parameters of the
intracluster gas velocity power-spectrum in independently simulated X-IFU
observations of a galaxy cluster. We evaluated the precision of the recovery
for different models. We show the necessity to use methods such as SBI to avoid
an under-estimation of the sources of variance by comparing the results to our
previous paper. We confirm that sample variance severely impacts the precision
of recovered turbulent features. Our results demonstrate the need for advanced
modeling methods to tackle the complexity of the physical information nested
within future observations expected from X-IFU/NewAthena.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12794v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence that Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch Decreases with
  Metallicity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yaguang Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 12 figures. submitted to AAS journals. comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) influences stellar evolution,
properties of stellar populations, and Galactic chemical enrichment, yet
remains poorly constrained observationally. Current models provide limited
insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass,
affects RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses
the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants
as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution,
allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing
masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler
sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several
points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements
with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB
decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The
average mass loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass
differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also show a similar
trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted
in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the
observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This
highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11597v1" target="_blank"><h2>A luminous and hot infrared through X-ray transient at a 5 kpc offset

Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream that are ${>}10''$ from any galaxy in
public imaging data from the PanSTARRS survey. Here, we present the first
discovery from this search: AT 2024puz, a luminous multiwavelength transient
offset by $5\,$kpc from a ${\sim}10^8\,M_\odot$ galaxy at $z=0.356$ with a
low-moderate star formation rate. It produced luminous $10^{44.79 \pm
0.04}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ optical/UV emission that evolved on a ${\sim}20\,$day
timescale, as well as $10^{44.12\pm0.03}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ X-ray emission
with a photon-index $\Gamma=1.7$. No associated radio or millimeter emission
was detected. We show that the early-time optical emission is likely powered by
reprocessing of high-energy, accretion-powered radiation, with a possible
contribution from a shock in a dense circum-transient medium. If the shock is
dominant at early-times, the circum-transient medium has a mass
${\sim}0.1-1\,M_\odot$, radius $10^{15}\,$cm, and a density profile shallower
than ${\sim}r^{-1}$. A near-infrared excess appears at late-times and is
suggestive of reprocessing within a wind or other circum-transient medium. The
X-rays are most consistent with a central engine. We suggest that AT 2024puz
may be associated with an accretion event onto a $50-10^5\,M_\odot$ BH, where
the lower masses are preferred based on the large projected offset from the
host galaxy. AT2024puz exhibits properties similar to both luminous fast blue
optical transients (LFBOTs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), but is
intermediate between them in its energetics and evolution timescale. This
highlights the need for broader exploration of the landscape of hot optical
transients to trace their origins.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13568v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Luminosity of the Darkness: Schechter function in dark sirens</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Cezary Turski, Maria Lisa Brozzetti, Gergely Dálya, Michele Punturo, Archisman Ghosh</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 9 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a novel avenue for probing the Universe. One
of their exciting applications is the independent measurement of the Hubble
constant, $H_0$, using dark standard sirens, which combine GW signals with
galaxy catalogues considering that GW events are hosted by galaxies. However,
due to the limited reach of telescopes, galaxy catalogues are incomplete at
high redshifts. The commonly used GLADE+ is complete only up to redshift
$z=0.1$, necessitating a model accounting for the galaxy luminosity
distribution accounting for the selection function of galaxies, typically
described by the Schechter function. In this paper, we examine the influence of
the Schechter function model on dark sirens, focusing on its redshift evolution
and its impact on $H_0$ and rate parameters measurements. We find that
neglecting the evolution of the Schechter function can influence the prior in
redshift on GWs, which has particularly high impact for distant GW events with
limited galaxy catalogue support. Moreover, conducting a joint estimation of
$H_0$ and the rate parameters, we find that allowing them to vary fixes the
bias in $H_0$ but the rate parameter $\gamma$ depends on the evolving Schechter
function. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating an evolving
Schechter function to account for changes in galaxy populations over cosmic
time, as this impacts rate parameters to which $H_0$ is sensitive.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13607v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large databases of metal-poor stars corrected for three-dimensional

metal-poor stars. In our Local Group, we can obtain spectra of individual stars
to measure their precise, but not always accurate, chemical abundances.
Unfortunately, stellar abundances are typically estimated under the simplistic
assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This can systematically
alter both the abundance patterns of individual stars and global trends of
chemical enrichment. The SAGA database compiles the largest catalogue of
metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. For the first time, we provide the community
with the SAGA catalogue fully corrected for non-LTE (NLTE) effects, using
state-of-the-art publicly available grids. In addition, we present an
easy-to-use online tool NLiTE that quickly provides NLTE corrections for large
stellar samples. For further scientific exploration, NLiTE facilitates the
comparison of different NLTE grids to investigate their intrinsic
uncertainties. Finally, we compare the NLTE-SAGA catalogue with our
cosmological galaxy formation and chemical evolution model, NEFERTITI. By
accounting for NLTE effects, we can solve the long-standing discrepancy between
models and observations in the abundance ratio of [C/Fe], the best tracer of
the first stellar populations. At low [Fe/H]<-3.5, models are unable to
reproduce the high measured [C/Fe] in LTE, which are lowered in NLTE, aligning
with simulations. Other elements are a mixed bag: some show improved agreement
with models (e.g. Na) and others worse (e.g. Co). Few elemental ratios do not
change significantly (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe]). Properly accounting for NLTE
effects is fundamental for interpreting the chemical abundances of metal-poor
stars. Our NLiTE tool thus enables a meaningful comparison of stellar samples
with stellar and chemical evolution models and low-metallicity gaseous
environments at higher redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10944v1" target="_blank"><h2>Polarimetric insights into a potential binary supermassive black hole

galaxies (ULIRGs) known to date. It displays a unique optical-UV spectrum,
characterized by a strong and perplexing attenuation in the near-UV, associated
with a sudden polarization peak. Building on previous spectro-photometric
modeling, we investigated the hypothesis that the core of Mrk 231 may host a
binary SMBH system. In this scenario, the accretion disk of the primary, more
massive SMBH is responsible for the optical-UV spectrum. The disk of the
secondary, less massive SMBH, would be expected to essentially emit in the far
UV. We applied this model to archival photometric and polarimetric data of Mrk
231 and tried to obtain the best fit possible. To support our findings, we
performed radiative transfer calculations to determine the spatial disposition
of each main component constituting Mrk 231. We find that a binary SMBH model
can reproduce both the observed flux and polarization of Mrk 231 remarkably
well. We infer that the core potentially hosts a binary SMBH system, with a
primary SMBH of about 1.6x10^8 solar masses and a secondary of about 1.1x10^7
solar masses , separated by a semimajor axis of 146 AU.The secondary SMBH
drives a degree of polarization of 3 % between 0.1 and 0.2 {\mu}m, with a
corresponding polarization position angle of about 134{\deg} , which is
consistent with scattering within an accretion disk. The primary SMBH and the
structure around it are responsible for a degree of polarization of 23 %
between 0.3 and 0.4 {\mu}m with a corresponding polarization position angle of
about 96{\deg} , that is possibly attributed to scattering within the quasar's
wind. Finally, our model predicts the existence of a second peak in polarized
flux in the far-ultraviolet, a telltale signature that could definitively prove
the presence of a binary SMBH.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11357v1" target="_blank"><h2>The systemic recoil velocity distribution and the scale height of
  isolated millisecond pulsar systems: Implications on neutron star retention
  fractions in star clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hao Ding</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation and estimating
the retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters, which can potentially be
determined with astrometric studies that take into account MSPs' long-term
dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled
65 isolated (or field) MSP systems (including lone MSPs) that are well
astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar (or space)
velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. We find that the
observed Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$
can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions.
Assuming that 1) $v_\mathrm{l}$ are statistically stable over time (the
"stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption), and 2) $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$
directions are uniformly distributed (the
"isotropic-$\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$" assumption), the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$
distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian
components. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived
$v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption
in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current
Galaxy-wide scale heights of isolated MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.66
kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution,
$\sim13$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster (GC) with the nominal 50
$\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the
$v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of isolated MSP systems may account for the high
number of MSPs discovered in GCs, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may
follow the same formation channel(s) as isolated MSP systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10970v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bullet shooting cloud-cloud collision in MIR bubble N65</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  En Chen, Xi Chen, Min Fang, Xuepeng Chen, Qianru He, Tian Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report that the formation of the twin-bubble system N65 and N65bis may be

with the dynamical ages of the two \HII regions in N65a (0.73 Myr for N65bis
and 1.19 Myr for N65, respectively), indicating their CCC-related origin. A
total of 354 young stellar objects (YSOs) are founded, which are clustered into
eight MST (Minimum Spinning Tree) groups. The distribution of M1 (at the
post-frontal edge) and M2, M3, M4 (at the pre-frontal edge) suggests that the
CCC triggers star formation along the collision path of $b=0^{\circ}.35$, with
younger YSOs present at the pre-frontal edge. Therefore, the bipolar morphology
of the twin-bubble system can be interpreted by the collision of N65a and N65b
along $b=0^{\circ}.35$ about 2 Myr ago.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11609v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ultraviolet variability in Solar-type members of the M67 open cluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Carl Melis, Ekamjot Kaire</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ. 29 pages including 4 main text figures, 3 tables (one quite long), and one appendix featuring 2 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Solar-type members of the rich, nearly Solar-age and Solar-metallicity M67
open cluster are systematically investigated for ultraviolet variability. We
utilize archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) data which features several
imaging observation epochs spanning 5 years. Stars in or suspected of being in
binary systems are avoided as well as stars that are blended in GALEX data,
leading to a sample of 66 Solar-type stars. We assess variability over a
variety of timescales that probe flares and longer-term trends that could be
due to rotation and activity cycles. We do not find conclusive evidence for
variability and determine that Solar-type members of M67 do not display >30%
near-ultraviolet variability over timescales ranging from days to years.
Furthermore, within 50-second cadence lightcurves generated for each of the
imaging epochs we find no near-ultraviolet flares that are >~2x the quiescent
stellar near-ultraviolet emission level; the implied ultraviolet flare rate
derived from this study is in mild tension with that derived for stars observed
by GALEX in the primary Kepler field. This M67 GALEX study presents one of the
most comprehensive ultraviolet datasets currently available for probing
continuum emission variability for old Sun-like stars; the planned NASA UVEX
mission has the potential to dramatically expand upon this work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13399v1" target="_blank"><h2>Filtering out large-scale noise for cluster weak-lensing mass estimation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  C. Murray, C. Combet, C. Payerne, M. Ricci</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Comments and questions welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a new method for estimating galaxy cluster masses using
weak-lensing magnification. The effect of weak-lensing magnification introduces
a correlation between the position of foreground galaxy clusters and the
density of background sources. Therefore, cluster masses can be inferred
through observations of these correlations. In this work, we introduce a method
that allows us to considerably reduce noise correlations between different
radial bins of the cluster magnification signal via a Wiener filtering of our
observed magnification field on large scales. This method can reduce the
uncertainty on the estimated galaxy cluster mass and it can also be applied to
cluster mass estimation for weak-lensing shear. The method was applied to
Hyper-Suprime Cam galaxies and CAMIRA clusters detected within the
Hyper-Suprime Cam survey (HSC). With HSC data, we find that our filtering
method significantly reduces the correlation of noise between radial
magnification bins. The estimated cluster mass is consistent between the
filtered and unfiltered methods, with similar errors between the two methods as
our current measurement errors contain significant contributions from the
irreducible shot-noise. For deeper surveys, the effects of shot noise will be
less important and this method will lead to greater improvements on the
estimated cluster mass.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11328v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the dark matter formation scenario of NGC 4147</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andrés E.

Accepted for publication in Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report results on the radial velocity dispersion profile built out to the
outskirts of NGC 4147, a Milky Way globular cluster with detected strong tidal
tails. The cluster was chosen to probe, from an observational point of view,
recent simulations that suggest that rising velocity dispersion profiles at
large distance from the clusters' centers would be seen in globular clusters
without tidal tails. From GEMINI@GMOS spectra, centered in the infrared CaII
triplet region, of selected stars located along the onset of NGC 4147's tidal
tails, we measured their radial velocities and overall metallicities. The
derived metallicities were used to ultimately assessing on the highly-ranked
cluster candidates of 9 stars, located between ~ 7 and 33 pc from the cluster's
center, suitable for testing the aforementioned simulations. We complemented
the present radial velocities with others available in the literature for
cluster's members, and built a cluster velocity dispersion profile which
suggests a mostly flat or slightly rising profile at large distances from the
cluster's center. This outcome confirms that kinematically hot outermost
cluster's stars are seen in NGC 4147, which disproves the recent model
predictions. Nevertheless, the mean velocity dispersion of the outermost
cluster's stars agrees with NGC 4147 being formed in a 10^8-10^9Mo dwarf galaxy
with a cored dark matter profile that later was accreted on to the Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14400v1" target="_blank"><h2>A New Wavelet Scattering Transform-Based Statistic for Cosmological

tailored data preprocessing strategy--particularly a high-density apodization
technique--and defining a new statistical measure, the WST $m$-mode ratios, we
assess performance using \texttt{CosmicGrowth} N-body simulations across three
datasets: WMAP, mWMAP, and Planck. We find that only the WST ratio $R^{\rm

cosmological parameters $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm cos} \gg 1$ while maintaining
$\chi^2_{\nu, \rm bias} \sim 1$ for tracer bias--a regime unattained by any
other statistic. These results highlight $R^{\rm wst}$ as a promising tool for
future galaxy surveys, offering strong cosmological sensitivity with effective
bias mitigation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11209v2" target="_blank"><h2>The Parameter Dependence of $\mathbf{n_{s}}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ of the

solving both old background problems and new perturbation issues. Single-field
inflation is a candidate to illustrate the picture of the initial universe, and
various potential functions lead to different scenarios during the inflationary
stage. This paper introduces two essential parameters: the spectral index and
the tensor-to-scalar ratio detected from the initial power spectrum, derived
from the action of the scalar field and using approximation that the potential
is flat. A brief overview of the origins of Starobinsky Inflation, Chaotic
Inflation, Small Field Inflation, and Natural Inflation is also presented,
along with their mathematical representations. Finally, the results derived
from various inflation models regarding the index and ratio are tested using
the Planck data, and the deviations in each model are analyzed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13876v1" target="_blank"><h2>The dynamics of the parsec-scale jet in the neutrino blazar PKS 0735+178</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yu-Sik Kim, Jae-Young Kim</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events
suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of
extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and
neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse
Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the
lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical
conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS
0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event
IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories.
We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during
2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux
and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in
the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron
opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening
the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find
that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before
IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the
historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving
feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at
the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically
coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the
location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208.
We discuss the physical implications of these findings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11440v1" target="_blank"><h2>FUOr-Aur 0544+3330: A New YSO Outburst in the Outskirts of Auriga OB1,

reached a peak in early 2021. Suspected young stellar object WISE
J054452.25+333009.6 experienced substantial brightening, in excess of $-5$ mag
at optical wavelengths and $-2.5$ mag at mid-infrared wavelengths. The time
from near-quiescence to peak brightness was approximately 24 months. Optical
and near-infrared spectra confirm that the outbursting source (hereby
designated FUOr-Aur 0544+3330) shows all the hallmarks of the FU Ori class,
including the Li I indicator of stellar youth. The mix of ionized and neutral
atomic lines, alongside prominent molecular absorption features, is consistent
with the expected change in spectral type from earlier in the optical to
later-type in the near-infrared. The closest analog among well-studied FU Ori
objects is V1515 Cyg. Both sources have unusually narrow-lined absorption
spectra that can be explained by a face-on disk orientation, such that
disk-broadening is minimized and wind-induced blueshift (in e.g. H$\alpha$,
NaD, Ca II) is maximized. Both the optical through infrared spectral energy
distribution and high-resolution spectrum are well-fit by a pure-accretion disk
model. Adopting a distance of $d=1.5$ kpc, the accretion and central star
parameters are: $\dot{M} = 10^{-5.48}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_* = 0.17 \
M_\odot$, and $R_\mathrm{inner} = 1.04 \ R_\odot$. Other fitted values are disk
inclination $i=5.9$ deg and source extinction $A_V=1.83$ mag. These parameters
yield accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc} = 8.4\ L_\odot$ and maximum disk
temperature $T_{\rm{max}} = 6218$ K.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11268v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark standard siren cosmology with bright galaxy subsets</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Khuzaifa Naveed, Cezary Turski, Archisman Ghosh</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 4 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this short paper, we investigate the impact of selecting only a subset of

the extensive studies of metal-poor stars. However, the r-process enrichment in
the metal-rich regime is still not well understood. In this study, we examine
the abundance ratios of Th and Eu, which represent the actinides and
lanthanides, respectively, for a sample of metal-rich disk stars. Our sample
covers 89 giant stars in the Kepler field with metallicities $-0.7 \leq
\rm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.4$ and ages from a few hundred Myr to $\sim 14$ Gyr. Age
information for this sample is available from stellar seismology, which is
essential for studying the radioactive element Th. We derive Th and Eu
abundances through $\chi^2$ fitting of high-resolution archival spectra ($R
\sim 80,000$) observed with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) at the
Subaru Telescope. We create synthetic spectra for individual stars using a 1D
LTE spectral synthesis code, Turbospectrum, adopting MARCS model atmospheres.
Our study establishes the use of a less extensively studied Th II line at 5989
angstrom, carefully taking into account the blends of other spectral lines to
derive the Th abundance. We successfully determine Eu abundance for 89 stars in
our sample and Th for 81 stars. For the remaining 8 stars, we estimate the
upper limits of Th abundance. After correcting the Th abundance for the decay,
we find no correlation between $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ and $\rm{[Fe/H]}$, which
indicates that actinides production with respect to lanthanides does not depend
on metallicity. On the other hand, we find a positive correlation of
$\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ with age, with a slope of $0.10 \pm 0.04$. This may hint at the
possibility that the dominant r-process sources are different between the early

dust in the Minimal Exponential Measure (MEMe) model, a theory which modifies
the couplings between gravity and matter without introducing dynamical degrees
of freedom. For a perfect fluid source, the field equations for the MEMe model
can be rewritten as the Einstein field equations sourced by a perfect fluid
with a transformed equation of state, which can endow a sufficiently dense
cloud of dust with an effective pressure. The resulting dust-supported
horizonless compact objects can have masses below $\sim 10^{-11}~M_\odot$,
making them suitable as MACHOs comprising a significant mass fraction for dark
matter. A necessary condition for the existence of these compact object
solutions is that the single free parameter in the MEMe model is
positive-valued. Additionally, we find that this positive sign for the
parameter can provide a mechanism for suppressing the formation of (primordial)
black holes from the gravitational collapse of matter below a certain mass
scale.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13305v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematic dynamos and resolution limits for Smoothed Particle

scales opens up a window into the physics of the early Universe. Numerical
simulations of such fields require a careful treatment to faithfully solve the
equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) without introducing numerical
artefacts. In this paper, we study the growth of the magnetic fields in
controlled kinematic dynamo setups using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics
implementations in the SWIFT code. We assess the quality of the reconstructed
solution in the Roberts flow case against the reference implementation in the
Pencil code and find generally a good agreement. Similarly, we reproduce the
known features of the more complex ABC flow. Using a simple induction-diffusion
balance model to analyse the results, we construct an "overwinding" trigger
metric to locally detect regions where the magnetic diffusion cannot counteract
the expected induction because of limitations in the method's ability to
resolve magnetic field gradients. This metric is then used to identify the
necessary resolution and resistivity levels to counteract the overwinding
problem. We finally apply this metric to adiabatic cosmological simulations and
discuss the resolution requirements needed to resolve the growth of the
primordial fields without artefacts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14047v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JCMT BISTRO-3 Survey: Variation of magnetic field orientations on

clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core
scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field
orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We
estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to
430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest
magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios
across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is
larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to
support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the
magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of
gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow
of material under gravity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12671v1" target="_blank"><h2>Idealized Global Models of Accretion Disks with Strong Toroidal Magnetic

with a strong toroidal magnetic field using an equation of state that fixes the
gas thermal scale height. The disk forms from the inflow of a rotating
magnetized gas cloud with a toroidal magnetic field. We find that the system
maintains a moderately strong mean azimuthal field in the midplane, with
plasma-$\beta\sim1$, trans-Alfv\'enic fluctuations, and large accretion
stresses $\alpha\sim0.1$. The azimuthal field in the disk is continuously
escaping along the vertical direction but is also replenished via a local
dynamo. The inflowing gas initially forms a strongly magnetized Keplerian disk
with $\beta\ll1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. The disk gradually collapses from the
inside out over $\sim 50-80$ orbits to form a moderately magnetized disk with
$\beta\sim1$ and $\alpha\sim0.1$. Radial advection of azimuthal magnetic field
can maintain $\beta\lesssim1$ exterior to the circularization radius but not
inside of it. Inclusion of a net initial vertical magnetic field can lead to an
even more strongly magnetized disk midplane, consistent with previous work.
When the gas thermal scale is not resolved ($\lesssim 4$ cells per thermal
scale height), however, the disk remains highly magnetized with $\beta \ll 1 $.
We discuss our results in the context of related shearing box simulations and
other global disk simulations. The level of angular momentum transport found
here is consistent with that inferred observationally in dwarf novae and X-ray
transient outbursts, unlike simulations of weakly magnetized accretion disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14077v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Hubble constant estimation with dark standard sirens and galaxy

D</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Oscillations in the primordial bispectrum are sourced by a range of
inflationary phenomena, including features in the inflaton potential and
interactions with massive fields through the Cosmological Collider scenario.
These signatures offer a powerful window into early-universe physics. In this
work, we study how oscillations of the form $\lim_{q\ll k}B(q,k)\propto
\cos(\mu \ln(q/k))$ impact the non-linear squeezed matter bispectrum. Using a
suite of $N$-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, we show
that non-linear evolution significantly damps these oscillations, effectively
erasing the signal on scales $k \gtrsim 0.3~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at redshift $z=0$.
This damping is well-described by the Zel'dovich approximation and can be
modeled deep into the non-linear regime using non-perturbative separate
universe simulations. Promisingly, we show that reconstruction techniques
developed for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analyses can largely undo this
damping, improving constraints on the amplitude (phase) of oscillations in the
primordial squeezed bispectrum by up to a factor of five (four) at $z=0$. We
also discuss several challenges with modeling the non-linear evolution of the
squeezed bispectrum in the Cosmological Collider scenario, where the bispectrum
is suppressed by a factor of $(q/k)^{3/2}$ relative to the template studied
here. Our findings pave the way for future searches for oscillatory bispectra

Gaia DR3 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys, such as LAMOST DR11,
APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR4. We selected 130 open clusters with well-defined
main sequences within 500 pc of the solar neighborhood as a benchmark sample to
estimate the reference atmospheric parameters of the members from the best-fit
isochrones of those clusters. By comparing the atmospheric parameters provided
by different spectroscopic surveys to the theoretical parameters, we found that
the atmospheric parameter deviation and the corresponding dispersions exhibit
different variations. The atmospheric parameter deviations of F, G, and K-type
stars are smaller than those of B, A, and M-type stars for most surveys. For
most samples, the dispersion of Teff decreases as temperature decreases,
whereas the dispersion of logg shows the opposite trend.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13626v1" target="_blank"><h2>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sean J.

Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to
explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS
35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the
context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a
new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this
framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow,
questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future
radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind
scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat
and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind
should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of
$\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted
mass-loss rate.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13209v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quantum confinement and carbon nanodots: A conceptual view for the
  origin of diffuse interstellar bands</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A. P. Jones</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, quant-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The nature of the Diffuse Interstellar Band (DIB) carriers is perhaps the
most studied, longest standing, unresolved problem in astronomy. While four
bands have been associated with the fullerene cation (C^+_60) the vast majority
(> 550) remain unidentified. This works is an attempt to provide a conceptual
framework for the typical energy transitions that are central to explaining the
origin of DIBs, however, it does not make an association between these
transitions and any particular DIBs. The effect of quantum confinement on
excitons is used, including charge transfer excitons, to construct a generic
basis for the electronic transitions that could, in principle, be coherent with
the energies associated with DIBs. In this model the carriers are carbon
nanodots (CNDs) modelled as nanodiamonds and a-C(:H) nanoparticles. These
preliminary results seem to show that particle size dependent effects in
nanodiamond and a-C(:H) CNDs could be consistent with the positions of, and
intervals between, some of the DIBs. One particular strength of the model is
that predicts single bands from the majority of single-size particles and, at
most, two bands from some of these same carriers. In the latter case the two
bands come from different transitions and may or may not inter-correlate,
depending upon the local environment. This generic framework indicates that the
size dependent fundamental transitions in CNDs could provide a viable scenario
for the origin of some DIB-type bands. While this work does not identify a
single DIB, it furnishes a conceptual view for the DIB origin, and suggests
that a more refined exploration of quantum confinement size effects, and
exciton physics within the astronomical domain might prove fruitful. This work
also hints at the requirement for stable configurations for particular size
domains in order to explain DIB wavelength stability.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13624v1" target="_blank"><h2>Viability of post-inflationary freeze-in with precision cosmology</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anirban Biswas, Sougata Ganguly, Dibyendu Nanda, Sujit Kumar Sahoo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Prediction of inflationary observables from the temperature fluctuation of
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can play a pivotal role in predicting the
reheating dynamics in the early universe. In this work, we highlight how the
inflationary observables, in particular the spectral index $n_s$, can play a
potential role in constraining the post-inflationary dark matter (DM)
production. We demonstrate a novel way of constraining the non-thermal
production of DM via UV freeze-in which is otherwise elusive in terrestrial
experiments. We consider a scenario in which DM is produced from this thermal
plasma via a dimension-five operator. The mutual connection between $n_s$ and
relic density of DM via the reheating temperature, $T_{\rm RH}$, enables us to
put constraints on the DM parameter space. For the minimal choice of the
inflationary model parameters and DM mass between $1\,\rm MeV$ to $1\,\rm TeV$,
we found that Planck alone can exclude the cut-off scale of the dimension-five
operator $\Lambda \lesssim 10^{12}\,\rm GeV$ which is significantly stronger
than any other existing constraints on such minimal scenario. If we impose the
combined prediction form Planck and recently released data by ACT, the
exclusion limit can reach up to the Planck scale for TeV-scale dark matter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12816v1" target="_blank"><h2>The polynomial potential inflation in light of ACT observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhi-Zhang Peng, Zu-Cheng Chen, Lang Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 2 figures;</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a
higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data,
challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we
investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the
latest ACT data, focusing on the quadratic ($n=2$) and cubic ($n=3$) models. By
exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model
coefficients, we find that the cubic model can provide a good fit to the data,
while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data
and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Our findings show that
higher-order polynomial potentials remain viable for describing cosmic
inflation, demonstrating how recent precision measurements continue to refine
our understanding of the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13623v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Reheating Phase via Non-Helical Magnetogenesis and Secondary
  Gravitational Waves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Subhasis Maiti, Debaprasad Maity, Rohan Srikanth</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in
observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the universe and its
evolutionary processes. However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating
phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional
observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily
provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean
information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to
explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from
electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into
the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies
across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile
and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical
magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled
with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct
spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating
histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\rm re}$). We
identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\rm re}<1/3$ and
$w_{\rm re}>1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO,
LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct
spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of
the reheating phase.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14335v1" target="_blank"><h2>Phase Transitions in Dimensional Reduction up to Three Loops</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mikael Chala, Luis Gil, Zhe Ren</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 14 pages of appendices, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We perform the first computation of phase-transition parameters to cubic
order in $\lambda\sim m^2/T^2$, where $m$ is the scalar mass and $T$ is the
temperature, in a simple model resembling the Higgs sector of the SMEFT. We use
dimensional reduction, including 1-loop matching corrections for terms of
dimension 6 (in 4-dimensional units), 2-loop contributions for dimension-4 ones
and 3-loops for the squared mass. We precisely quantify the size of the
different corrections, including renormalisation-group running as well as
quantum effects from light fields in the effective theory provided by the
Coleman-Weinberg potential, and discuss briefly the implications for
gravitational waves. Our results suggest that, for strong phase transitions,
1-loop corrections from dimension-6 operators can compete with 2-loop ones from
quartic couplings, but largely surpass those from 3-loop thermal masses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14187v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Systems and Superstring Phases in the Early Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Noelia Sánchez González, Joseph P.

exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating, in a
background of cosmic superstring loops. In the context of the LVS potential, we
demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution, in
which 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of
fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the
standard radiation tracker). On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in
the string tension as the volume scalar evolves that makes the loops stable
against decay. For more general non-LVS potentials, mixed radiation-loop
trackers can also occur.</p></br></body>
