  of Ionizing Sources as drivers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Arghyadeep Basu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> PhD.

in the early Universe when the first luminous sources formed and their
radiation transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to ionized.
Understanding this process reveals how the first stars and galaxies formed,
influenced their surroundings, and shaped large-scale structures. The work
traces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that
produced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the
thermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet
luminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies. It shows that different
supernova feedback models drive distinct UVLF variability across mass and
redshift, potentially alleviating the bright-galaxy tension seen by JWST. The
second part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary
stars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active
galactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen
reionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer
simulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how
the timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and
He II Ly-alpha observations. Finally, predictions for the 3.5 cm hyperfine
transition of singly ionized helium-3 offer a novel probe of the
post-reionization IGM. Together, these studies combine galaxy formation,
radiative processes, and IGM evolution to provide a coherent picture of cosmic
reionization and its observable signatures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23568v1" target="_blank"><h2>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results IV.

Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI.
COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular
gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\sim3$. COMAP's Season 2 represents a $3\times$
increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release.
We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit
of $10.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{K\ km\ s^{-1}\ pc^2}$ at 95\% confidence within
an $\sim 18\ \mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the
CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\sim 3 \sigma$) tension
between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite
of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including
quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and
interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a
measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars' wider environment and is
therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With
our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to
confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely,
the stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the
potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are
able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key
goal of COMAP).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23343v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Cosmic Baryon Cycle in IllustrisTNG: flows of mass, energy, and

through the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) of
galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 simulations. We identify the dominant feedback
mechanism in bins of halo virial mass and redshift by computing the integrated
energy input from SNe and the ``kinetic'' and ``thermal'' mode of AGN feedback.
We measure all quantities in a shell at the virial radius (``halo scale'') and
one chosen to be approximately at the interface of the CGM and the interstellar
medium (ISM; ``ISM scale''). We find that galaxies have strong net positive
inflows on halo scales, and weaker but still net positive inflows on ISM
scales, at $z\gtrsim 2$. At later times, partially due to the onset of kinetic
AGN feedback in massive halos, inflows and outflows nearly balance one another,
leading to the familiar effects of the slow-down of galaxy growth and the onset
of quenching. Halos dominated by SN feedback show only weak evidence of
preventative feedback on halo scales, and we see excess ISM scale accretion
indicative of rapid gas recycling. Wind mass loadings decrease with increasing
halo mass, and with increasing redshift, while energy loadings are nearly
independent of both mass and redshift. The detailed catalogs of these mass,
metal, and energy inflow and outflow rates on galaxy and halo scales can be
used to guide empirical and semi-analytic models, and provide deeper insight
into how galaxy growth and quenching is regulated in the IllustrisTNG
simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23548v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole

stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We
employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius
of the $\alpha$-accretion disc ($ < 0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the
interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the
self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of
stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively,
producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included,
fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding
the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the
ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both
radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent:
it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being
replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes
place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling
the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH
growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with
IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy
models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with
future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA,
and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift
supermassive BHs observed by JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22447v1" target="_blank"><h2>Introducing the Seyfert-LINER Index (SLI): High Resolution (< 100pc)

analysis of ESO 137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based
on narrowband {\it HST} imaging in [O III], [S II], H$\alpha$, and H$\beta$
emission lines. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-,
and H II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$
($\sim20$ pc at $z=0.009$). To characterize the fine spatial structure of the {
different excitation mechanism}, we introduce a new parameter: the
Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point
in the BPT diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. The narrowband optical
emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission
observed with \textit{Chandra}. Most of the emission within the bi-cones is
Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with AGN photoionization. The
North-West Seyfert cone is surrounded by a $\sim100$--$200$ pc thick LINER
cocoon with a smooth, monotonic SLI profile, shaped by either AGN wind-ISM
interactions, and/or obscured AGN radiation; three radial SLI peaks suggest
episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$ yrs and
$< 100$ yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a
higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced
soft emission and the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by
line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($>1000$ km s$^{-1}$) induced
excitation. The LINER cocoon in the SE cone appears more irregular, with
inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks.
Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback
mechanisms in the ISM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22403v1" target="_blank"><h2>SHELLQs-JWST: Revealing the Spectra of Extended Emission in 12 z > 6

spectra of extended host galaxy emission in 12 quasars from the Subaru High-z
Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) sample at redshifts 6.0 < z <
6.4. The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two
Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the
quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we
analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12
systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008
emission line, we measure a 132 ${\pm}$ 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system
and 52 ${\pm}$ 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From
the extended narrow H${\alpha}$ emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by
star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates
ranging from ${\sim}$ 7 to 111 M${_\odot}$/yr, the majority of which are
consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ${\approx}$ 6. The
positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/H${\beta}$ vs.
log10[NII]6584/H${\alpha}$ (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram
indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe,
but are consistent with the placement of similar z ${\approx}$ 6 quasar host
galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and
star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts. We conclude from the
consistency between our quasar host sample with z ${\sim}$ 6 galaxies that the
presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the
properties of galaxies at z ${\approx}$ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21918v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM constraints on the velocity power spectrum in the Coma cluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  D.

information on the virialization of infalling material, the dissipation of AGN
energy into the surrounding medium, and the validity of the hydrostatic
hypothesis. The statistical properties of the velocity field are characterized
by its fluctuation power spectrum, which is usually expected to be well
described by an injection scale and a turbulent cascade. Here we propose a
simulation-based inference technique to retrieve the properties of the velocity
power spectrum from X-ray micro-calorimeter data by generating simulations of
Gaussian random fields from a parametric power spectrum model. We forward model
the measured bulk velocities and velocity dispersions by including the most
relevant observational effects (projection, emissivity weighting, PSF
smearing). We then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the
power spectrum parameters and the generated data vectors. Considering a
three-parameter model describing turbulent energy injection on large scales and
a power-law cascade, we found that two XRISM/Resolve pointings are sufficient
to accurately determine the turbulent Mach number and set interesting
constraints on the injection scale. Applying our method to the Coma cluster
data, we obtain a model that is characterized by a large injection scale that
rivals the size of the cluster ($\ell_{inj}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+2.0}$ Mpc). When this
power spectrum model is integrated over the cluster scales ($0<\ell < R_{500}=1.4
$Mpc), the Mach number of the gas motions is
$\mathcal{M}_{3D,500}=0.45_{-0.13}^{+0.18}$, which exceeds the value derived
from the velocity dispersions only. Further observations covering a wider area
are required to decrease the cosmic variance and constrain the slope of the
turbulent cascade.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22779v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio Follow-Up Observations of a Weak-Line Quasar Exhibiting Remarkable

exhibited exceptional X-ray variability in 2019$-$2020, with its X-ray flux
increasing by over 20 times from 2013 to 2019 and subsequently dropping by at
least a factor of nine in 2020. Motivated by the empirical correlations between
X-ray and radio emission in AGN cores, we carried out a follow-up radio study
in the 0.3$-$10 GHz range using GMRT (2020, 2022, 2024) and VLA (2022), and
analyzed archival VLASS 3 GHz data (2017-2023) to investigate the source's
radio properties and potential connection with the X-ray behavior. Our
observations reveal a compact radio source with a spectral index of
-0.65$\pm$0.15 in the frequency range of 0.3$-$1.4 GHz and -1.09$\pm$0.16 in
3$-$10 GHz. While the source was undetected in VLA-FIRST (1994) and VLASS
epochs, the GMRT and VLA observations show no statistically significant
variability over the monitored period. The absence of detectable changes in the
radio flux, despite strong X-ray variability, suggests no direct connection
between the X-ray variability and the radio emission, consistent with the
Thick-Disk plus Outflow (TDO) model for WLQs. However, the sensitivity limit of
the surveys prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions regarding longer
timescale variability between the VLA-FIRST and GMRT epochs. We further explore
possible mechanisms driving the radio emission from this source. Our analysis
rules out small-scale jets and coronal emission as the primary drivers of the
radio emission, suggesting that extended emission from AGN winds and star
formation is the more plausible mechanism.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23406v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIGHTEE-HI: The HI mass-stellar mass relation of massive galaxies and

$M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relation based on a stellar-mass selected sample at
$0.25 < z < 0.5$ and the MIGHTEE-HI DR1 spectral data. Using a powerful
Bayesian stacking technique, for the first time we are also able to measure the
underlying bivariate distribution of HI mass and stellar mass of galaxies with
$M_\star > 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, finding that an asymmetric underlying HI
distribution is strongly preferred by our complete samples. We define the
concepts of the average of the logarithmic HI mass, $\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm

M_{\rm HI}\rangle)$, and find that the difference between
$\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$ and $\log_{10}(\langle M_{\rm
HI}\rangle)$ can be as large as $\sim$0.5 dex for the preferred asymmetric HI
distribution. We observe shallow slopes in the underlying $M_{\rm
HI}-M_{\star}$ scaling relations, suggesting the presence of an upper HI mass
limit beyond which a galaxy can no longer retain further HI gas. From our
bivariate distribution we also infer the HI mass function at this redshift and
find tentative evidence for a decrease of 2-10 times in the co-moving space
density of the most HI massive galaxies up to $z\sim 0.5$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23206v1" target="_blank"><h2>QUEST (Quasar Unsupervised Encoder and Synthesis Tool): A machine

hole (BH) growth and evolution but notoriously difficult to identify. At these
redshifts, machine learning-based selection methods have proven to be
efficient, but require appropriate training sets to express their full
potential. Here, we present QUEST, a Variational Auto-Encoder capable of
generating realistic quasar spectra that can be post-processed for generating
synthetic photometry and for spectral imputation. We start from the SDSS DR16Q
catalogue, pre-process the spectra, and vet the sample to obtain a clean data
set. After training the model, we investigate the properties of its latent
space to understand whether it has learnt relevant physics. We provide a
pipeline to generate photometry from the sampled spectra, compare it with
actual quasar photometry, and showcase the capabilities of the model in
reconstructing and extending quasar spectra. The trained network faithfully
reproduces the input spectrum, both in terms of sample median and variance. By
examining the latent space, we find correlations with continuum and bolometric
luminosity, BH mass, redshift, continuum slope, and emission line properties.
When used to generate photometry, we find results in excellent agreement with
the control sample. The model provides satisfactory results in reconstructing
emission lines: estimates of the BH mass from the reconstructed spectra are in
good agreement with those from the original spectra. Furthermore, when spectra
with broad absorption line features are reconstructed, the model successfully
interpolates over the absorption systems. Compared with previous work, we find
excellent agreement between the spectra sampled from our model and the output
of their results. However, QUEST does not require any ad-hoc tuning, and is
capable of reproducing the full variety of spectra available in the training
set.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23522v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic bars and active galactic nucleus fuelling in the second half of

Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to $z\sim 0.8$. We utilise a Deep
Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify
(strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent
diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE,
quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity
($f_{\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\rm disc}$). We assess the impact
of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against
carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred
control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that
barred disc galaxies host a statistically detectable higher fraction of AGN
compared to their unbarred counterparts, suggesting a contributing role for
bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears
confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host
galaxy's emission ($f_{\rm AGN} < 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant
dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\rm AGN} > 0.75$,
independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred
galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\rm disc}$. Combined
with previous results, we suggest that bars contribute to fuelling the
population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the
principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion
events.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22633v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic magnification on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Marcos M.

offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster
formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF),
quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we
spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional
47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub
the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two
subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with
log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense
environments at z>3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density
2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) >
10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the
color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to
date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent
members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced
quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The
stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact
at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo
mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and
log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis
indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work
reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming
cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive
halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22079v1" target="_blank"><h2>The variability angular diameter distance and the intrinsic brightness

It has recently been suggested that angular diameter distances
derived from comparing the variability timescales of blazars to angular size
measurements with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) may provide an
alternative method to study the cosmological evolution of the Universe. Once
the intrinsic brightness temperature ($T_{\rm int}$) is known, the angular
diameter distance may be found without knowledge of the relativistic Doppler
factor, opening up the possibility of a single rung distance measurement method
from low $(z_{\rm cos}\ll1)$ to high $(z_{\rm cos}>4)$ redshifts. Aims. We aim
to verify whether the variability-based estimates of the intrinsic brightness
temperature of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGNs) converges to a common
value. We also investigate whether the intrinsic brightness temperature changes
as a function of frequency. Methods. We estimated the $T_{\rm int}$ of AGNs
based on the flux variability of the radio cores of their jets. We utilized
radio core light curves and size measurements of 75 sources at 15 GHz and of 37
sources at 43 GHz. We also derived $T_{\rm int}$ from a population study of the
brightness temperatures of VLBI cores using VLBI survey data of more than $100$
sources at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Results. Radio core variability-based estimates
of $T_{\rm int}$ constrain upper limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$< 11.56$
at 15~GHz and $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$< 11.65$ at 43 GHz under a certain set
of geometric assumptions. The population analysis suggests lower limits of
$\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$>9.7$, $9.1$, and $9.3$ respectively at 24, 43, and
86 GHz. Even with monthly observations, variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm
int}$ appear to be cadence-limited. Conclusions. Methods used to constrain
$T_{\rm int}$ are more uncertain than previously thought. However, with
improved datasets, the estimates should converge.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23311v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of supercluster filaments in shaping galaxy clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Raúl Baier-Soto, Yara Jaffé, Alexis Finoguenov, P.

primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the
shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of
galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments,
providing the first observational test of this relationship in large
supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two
dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift
sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the
Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the
alignment between filament directions -- traced by galaxy distributions -- and
the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials -- traced by X-ray
emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that
most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the
optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows
that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments,
providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the
alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($> 1.6
r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main
source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide
evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational

($n_e=10^2-10^9$ cm$^{-3}$), combined with HST and JWST spectroscopy for a

that assuming uniform, low-density conditions ($n_e\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) in
high-density environments ($n_e\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) can bias nebular

$>1$ dex), and underestimating O/H (up to 0.67 dex), while only modestly
inflating N/O. Therefore, robust abundance determinations at high-$z$ require a
multi-phase density model. Using this model, we recalculate O/H and N/O
abundances for our sample and present the first $\log U$ diagnostics and ICFs
for high-ionization UV N lines. We find that the UV tracers systematically
overestimate N/O by $\sim0.3-0.4$ dex relative to the optical benchmark. We
find that N/O increases with redshift, correlating with both $n_e$ and star
formation rate surface density ($\rm\Sigma_{SFR}$), suggesting that N/O is
temporarily enhanced in compact, high-pressure environments. However, the $n_e$
evolution with $z$ is more gradual than the $(1+z)^3$ scaling of virial halo

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain
parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such
as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer
additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and
power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To
address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the
bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level
bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field
theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on
synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the
transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the
bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian
smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the
statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum
prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k <= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the
cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use
a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew
spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally
applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field
in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and
line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory
prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced)
field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function
making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22152v1" target="_blank"><h2>A great diversity of spectral shapes in the ionising spectra of z ~

the stellar mass, and the chemical composition from the nebular emission lines.
We detect stellar LyC emission in seven out of eleven galaxies with escape

for f_esc(LyC) in the remaining galaxies. We discover for the first time
nebular LyC emission as a bump just bluewards of the LyC limit at 912A in two

following the [O III] ionization bicone. With spatially resolved spectral

most readily explained} as from a mixture of photo-ionized gas and shock-heated

feedback. By comparing the morphology of the { X-ray emission in narrow

component on top of the photonized emission of an outflowing wind. A similar
effect is only seen within the inner $1^{\prime\prime}$ ($200$ pc) of the NW

hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution
scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high
spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a
natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where
black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and
undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often
eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical
growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in
giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct
simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally
challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation
performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code,
referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most
massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This
simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur
in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with
masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events
observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation
with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to
extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular

speed distribution. This distribution has been inferred from simulations of
Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no
simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This
motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from
observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the
IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the
dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find
that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent
non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed
distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile,
recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be
traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar
populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark
matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good
alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these
two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter
speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize
stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from
the Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar

formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity. We quantify velocity map morphology
using harmonic expansion and adopt two complementary diagnostics: the global
kinematic asymmetry, which traces non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the
first-order term ratio, which captures axisymmetric radial motions. We find
that galaxies with higher kinematic asymmetry are more likely to deviate from
the scaling relations, typically lying either above or below the star formation
main sequence and systematically below the mass-metallicity relation. In
contrast, the first-order term ratio shows only a correlation with gas-phase
metallicity in the low-mass range and no significant dependence on star
formation rate. Moreover, galaxies below the mass-metallicity relation
generally exhibit higher HI gas fractions. These results suggest that external
gas accretion is the primary driver of the observed phenomena: inflowing
metal-poor gas increases velocity map asymmetry in disk galaxies, dilutes the
metallicity, and triggers enhanced star formation. Feedback-driven outflows,
bar- and spiral-driven inflows, and galaxy mergers may also contribute, but
likely play a secondary role.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21919v1" target="_blank"><h2>Suppressed "lump" EM signature in radiation pressure dominated accreting

of accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations,
using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We model
binaries embedded in a self-gravitating circumbinary disc that evolves
following an adiabatic equation of state, including viscous heating and
black-body cooling. Focusing on binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \,
M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q=1, 0.7$, we find
that radiation pressure significantly affects both the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and the light curves (LCs). The emission from the
mini-discs shifts from the optical towards UV frequencies and with a peak
luminosity orders of magnitude higher, while the circumbinary disc becomes
colder and dimmer as a result of its geometrically thinner configuration.
Temporal variability is affected as well: near UV and soft-X ray fluxes are
higher and more variable. Crucially, radiation pressure suppresses the
characteristic "lump" formation in equal-mass circular systems, while a lump is
formed for higher eccentricities without imprinting any modulation on the flux.
In the circular case we still find a modulation on the cavity edge timescale at
a frequency $0.36 \, f_{\rm K}$, while in eccentric binaries, only robust
orbital period modulations ($f=1,2 \, f_{\rm K}$) are observed, with no
modulation associated with the cavity orbital motion. Moreover, the enhanced
emission from the mini-discs and streams due to radiation pressure, one
redshifted, results in brighter flux in the optical G band, proving
detectability of MBHBs signatures even at higher redshift ($z=0.6-1.0$). Our
results reveal that radiation pressure plays a crucial role in shaping MBHBs
spectral and time-domain features, with implications for their identification
in time-domain surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22211v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ultraviolet Spectral Evidence for Ansky as a Slowly Evolving Featureless

increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the
recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy ("Ansky") appear to be linked to an
active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and
AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding
may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky's
nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a
featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines.
Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power law with an index of
-2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other
featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity
(10^43 erg s^-1) and much longer rise and decay timescales, suggesting a
distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole
is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3
sigma upper limit of 54 pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the
tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black
hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations,
although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future
observational efforts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22934v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting the 150 MHz Radio Luminosity Function of Star-Forming

(LF) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using deep observations from the LOFAR
Two-metre Sky Survey in the ELAIS-N1, Bo\"{o}tes, and Lockman Hole fields. Our
sample comprises $\sim$56,000 SFGs over $0 < z < 5.7$. We first analyze the
deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting
for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel
density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift
and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results
reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE).
Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure
luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full
maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and
constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts
(SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly
favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C)
provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B
balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models
reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges,
whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of
the LF, likely due to residual AGN contamination. This study demonstrates that

data from the FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI). Taking advantage of FAST's blind,
wide-area coverage and uniform sensitivity, we assemble a sample of $230$ group
galaxies and a matched control sample of isolated systems, and apply
censored-data modeling to include both detections and non-detections. At fixed
stellar mass and color, we find that the global median HI fraction of group
galaxies differs from that of controls by only $-0.04$ dex ($95\%$ CI [$-0.18,\
0.16$]), indicating at most a mild average offset. The signal is not uniform
across populations: satellites are HI-poor (median $\Delta
f_{\mathrm{HI}}=-0.12$ dex), whereas centrals are consistent with normal to
mildly HI-rich (median $\Delta f_{\mathrm{HI}}=0.13$ dex). Group galaxies
located within $0.5R_{180}$ and in denser systems (richness $>10$ or local
density $\Sigma>10\ \mathrm{gal\ Mpc^{-2}}$) show stronger negative offsets,
whereas galaxies in the outskirts are statistically indistinguishable from the
controls. These results refine earlier reports of global group HI deficiency:
with deeper blind data and uniform treatment of upper limits, we show that HI
depletion is primarily confined to satellites and compact cores rather than
being ubiquitous across groups.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23582v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic magnification on multi-catalogue Herschel submillimetre galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R.

produced additional sub-mm catalogues, though not optimised for spatial
statistical lensing analyses.} {Our goal is to refine cosmological constraints
from SMG magnification bias by exploiting the full sub-mm sky surveyed by
Herschel.} {We expanded the SMG sample by incorporating other Herschel
catalogues overlapping SDSS spectroscopic lenses. Random catalogues were
generated via kernel density estimation to compute cross-correlations, and
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were applied to infer astrophysical and
cosmological parameters for each catalogue and for the combined dataset.} {We
report the first detection of magnification bias in SMGs beyond H-ATLAS,
reinforcing the robustness of this observable. Individual Herschel catalogues
yield reasonable central values for $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, although with
large uncertainties. The combined analysis, dominated by the more powerful
H-ATLAS sample, gives results consistent with $\Lambda$CDM: $\Omega_m =
0.30^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$, $\sigma_8 = 0.80 (+/- 0.07)$, and $h < 0.80$, in better
agreement with \textit{Planck} 2018 than previous non-tomographic studies.}
{SMGs are promising tracers for magnification bias, but the narrow sub-mm

enable cross-correlations on larger scales, yielding tighter cosmological

spectra, motivating models that learn cross-modal representations. We build a
dataset of 134,533 galaxy images (HSC-PDR2) and spectra (DESI-DR1) and adapt a
Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoder (MMAE) to embed both images and spectra in a
shared representation. The MMAE is a transformer-based architecture, which we
train by masking 75% of the data and reconstructing missing image and spectral
tokens. We use this model to test three applications: spectral and image
reconstruction from heavily masked data and redshift regression from images
alone. It recovers key physical features, such as galaxy shapes, atomic
emission line peaks, and broad continuum slopes, though it struggles with fine
image details and line strengths. For redshift regression, the MMAE performs
comparably or better than prior multi-modal models in terms of prediction
scatter even when missing spectra in testing. These results highlight both the
potential and limitations of masked autoencoders in astrophysics and motivate
extensions to additional modalities, such as text, for foundation models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23533v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of SN 2025wny: a Strongly Gravitationally Lensed Superluminous

spectroscopic classification of this event as the first gravitationally lensed
Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). Deep ground-based follow-up
observations resolves four images of the supernova with ~1.7" angular
separation from the main lens galaxy, each coincident with the lensed images of
a background galaxy seen in archival imaging of the field. Spectroscopy of the
brightest point image shows narrow features matching absorption lines at a
redshift of z = 2.011 and broad features matching those seen in superluminous
SNe with Far-UV coverage. We infer a magnification factor of 20 to 50 for the
brightest image in the system, based on photometric and spectroscopic
comparisons to other SLSNe-I. SN 2025wny demonstrates that
gravitationally-lensed SNe are in reach of ground-based facilities out to
redshifts far higher than what has been previously assumed, and provide a
unique window into studying distant supernovae, internal properties of dwarf

240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of
redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift universe. We prove that the
peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by
structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of
stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation
for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that
characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified
solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation
mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of
progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events
exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index,
suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free
stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than
0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value
of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate
that future observations by EP/SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of
analogous events and further reveil information about progenitors and the
circum-environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23565v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Clustering-redshifts and importance

$3\times2$pt analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6). For DES Y6,
photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps
(SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To
overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete
spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating
clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular
cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We
define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of
SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering
measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The
analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while
mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent
galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal.
While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at
$z>1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with
WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological
constraining power of DES Y6. We estimate an improvement in $S_8$ of
approximately 10\% for cosmic shear and $3\times2$pt analysis, primarily due to
the WZ calibration of the source samples.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23113v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation

Discussions are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Very high energy (VHE) gama rays above 100 GeV are expected to undergo
significant attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with
thr extralactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations -
particulary the tentative detection of gamma ray burst GRB 221009A up to 18 TeV
by LHASSO and up to 251 TeV by Carpet-2, challenge the predictions of classical
EBL absorption models. These exceptionally high-energy photons suggest the
possibility of new physics affecting photon propagation over cosmological
distances. In this context, the gamma-ray spectrum in the tens to hundreds of
TeV range serves as a valuable probe for potential Lorentz invariance violation
(LIV) effects or for modifications to photon attenuation due to axion-like
particles (ALPs) mixing with photons in cosmic magnetic fields. However, both
LIV and ALPs explanations, when considered separately, face certain limitations
in fully accounting for the observed transparency. In this paper, we propose a
unified framework that combines the effects of ALPs and LIV to explain the
unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. Specifically, we
investigate the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this synergistic
scenario, demonstrating that for photons at 18 TeV and 251 TeV, the combined
influence of ALPs with coupling $g_{a\gamma} = 13.353 \times 10^{-11}\
\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass $m_a = 9.492 \times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{eV}$, together
with LIV characterized by energy scales $E_1 = 2.4~E_{\rm Planck}$ for $n = 1$
, can substantially enhance the photon survival probability. This synergy
offers a compelling explanation for the observed VHE gamma-ray transparency in
extreme astrophysical environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22979v1" target="_blank"><h2>A test of Amati relation using HII galaxy distances</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rikiya Okazaki, Shantanu Desai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use model-independent luminosity distances of 186 HII galaxy observations

measurements of IMBH masses using stellar kinematics, which will be observed
with the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral
(HARMONI) field spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) up to the
distance of 20 Mpc. Our sample focuses on both the Virgo Cluster in the
northern sky and the Fornax Cluster in the southern sky. We begin by
identifying dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters, which are thought to
be nurseries for IMBHs in the local universe. As a case study, we conduct
simulations for FCC 119, the second faintest dwarf galaxies in the Fornax
Cluster at 20 Mpc, which is also fainter than most of Virgo Cluster members. We
use the galaxy's surface brightness profile from Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
imaging, combined with an assumed synthetic spectrum, to create mock
observations with the {\tt HSIM} simulator and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM).
These mock HARMONI datacubes are analyzed as if they were real observations,
employing JAM within a Bayesian framework to infer IMBH masses and their
associated uncertainties. We find that ELT/HARMONI can detect the stellar
kinematic signature of an IMBH and accurately measure its mass for $M_{BH}
\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$ out to distances of $\sim$20 Mpc.</p></br></body>
