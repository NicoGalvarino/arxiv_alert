  (APOeGEE): Chemical Abundance Trends for Seven Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies in
  the APOGEE Survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Matthew Shetrone, Rachael L. Beaton, Christian R. Hayes, Sten Hasselquist, Joshua D. Simon, Jon A. Holtzman, Katia Cunha, Steven R.

the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) project observed seven
dwarf spheroidal satellites (dSphs) of the Milky Way: Carina, Sextans,
Sculptor, Draco, Ursa Minor, Bootes 1, and Fornax. APOGEE radial velocities,
stellar parameters, and Gaia EDR3 proper motions are used to identify member
stars in the vicinity of each dwarf. To properly analyze the abundance patterns
of these galaxies, a novel procedure was developed to determine the measurable
upper limits of the APOGEE chemical abundances as a function of the effective
temperature and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the APOGEE
abundance patterns of these galaxies (limited to [Fe/H] $>$ -2.5) agree with
those found in high-resolution optical studies after abundance offsets are
applied. Most of the galaxies studied have abundance patterns that are
distinctly different from the majority of stars found in the MW halo,
suggesting that these galaxies contributed little to the MW halo above [Fe/H]
$>$ -2.0. From these abundance patterns, we find that these dSphs tend to
follow two types of chemical evolution paths: episodic and continuous star
formation, a result that is consistent with previous photometric studies of
their star formation histories. We explore whether mass and/or environment have
an impact on whether a galaxy has an episodic or continuous star formation
history, finding evidence that, in addition to the galaxy's mass, proximity to
a larger galaxy and the cessation of star formation may drive the overall shape
of the chemical evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04202v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hadronic Processes in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow as the Origin
  of TeV Excesses in BL Lac Objects</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ji-Shun Lian, Ze-Rui Wang, Jin Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 6 Figures, 1 Table. Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs)
exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that
surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of
this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs
whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and
successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic
model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV
$\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron
and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons
in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission
resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring
within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a
hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff
energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius.
Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are
likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within
ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump
in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although
the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would
necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared
to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the
observed TeV excess.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03575v1" target="_blank"><h2>Broad Iron Line as a Relativistic Reflection from Warm Corona in AGN</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  P. P. Biswas, A. Różańska, F. H. Vincent, D. Lančová, P. T. Zycki</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables. After first round of revision in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be
explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a
dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an
accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located
above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and
FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona,
can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity
of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying
the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor.
Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using
high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code
TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the
ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray
spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the
disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation
and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized
iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the
black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV.
For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron
lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the
illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona
covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under
strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those
originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total
line profile in AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03394v1" target="_blank"><h2>The subtle statistics of the distance ladder: On the distance prior and
  selection effects</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Harry Desmond, Richard Stiskalek, Jose Antonio Najera, Indranil Banik</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 5 figures; submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Statistical methodology is rarely considered significant in distance ladder
studies or a potential contributor to the Hubble tension. We suggest it should
be, highlighting two appreciable issues. First, astronomical distances are
inferred latent parameters, requiring a prior. We show that the common
assumption of (perhaps implicit) uniform priors on distance moduli biases
distances low due to objects being intrinsically uniformly distributed in
volume. At fixed measured redshifts, this biases the Hubble constant high.
Second, selection effects introduce additional factors in the posterior. These
typically counteract the effect of the volume prior to some extent, but depend
significantly on the nature of the selection. Typical assumptions place $H_0$
at the top of the plausible range, corresponding to a redshift-selected sample.
After a detailed analytic and mock-based study of these effects, we apply them
to the CosmicFlows-4 sample, where introducing the distance prior causes an
approximately 12~per cent increase in distances and $>8$ km/s/Mpc (55
statistical $\sigma$) decrease in the Hubble constant for the case of volume or
magnitude selection. Redshift selection would fully undo this shift and is the
more likely scenario, as a phenomenological model shows. We also investigate
the SH0ES sample, where the volume-prior effect is modest ($1.6\sigma$) and is
likely already accounted for within the SH0ES pipeline. Our work highlights the
crucial need to model both the distance prior and selection accurately for
robust distance ladders and derived parameters. The latter requires samples
with known, homogeneous selection criteria, which should be prioritised in
future surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03543v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radiative transfer modeling of the low-mass proto-binary system, IRAS
  4A1 and 4A2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bratati Bhat, Ankan Das, Prasanta Gorai, Dipen Sahu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), outflow (abstract), dust (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> NGC 1333 IRAS4A is a well-studied low-mass sun-like proto-binary system. It
has two components, A1 and A2, which are diverse according to their physical
and chemical properties. We modeled this hot corino using the RATRAN radiative
transfer code and explained different spectral signatures observed towards A1
and A2, specifically for CH3OH and H2CO. Our main goal is to understand the
kinematical and chemical differences between A1 and A2 and to classify their
dust emission and absorption properties. We considered a simple 1D spherical
infalling envelope consisting of collimated outflow in the source. Recent
high-resolution interferometric observations of ALMA shed new light on why the
same molecular transitions towards A1 and A2 show different spectral profiles.
The significant difference between spectral profiles observed towards A1 and A2
is mainly due to the dust opacity effect. Dust continuum emission toward A1 is
optically thick, causing the transitions observed in absorption. Meanwhile, A2
is optically thin, leading to the observed emission profiles, and an inverse
P-Cygni profile suggests the presence of an infalling envelope. Using
high-resolution observations from ALMA and VLA, we expanded our model from the
millimeter wavelength range to the centimeter wavelength range. This expansion
demonstrates the opacity effect, which is reduced in the centimeter wavelength
range, causing us to observe the lines in emission. Using our model, we
reproduced the population inversion causing maser emission of methanol 44 GHz
and 95 GHz transitions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03262v1" target="_blank"><h2>The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave
  Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger
  Rate</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mohit Raj Sah, Suvodip Mukherjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 9 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries
(BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and
primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic
Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on
the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying
source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution.
However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian
in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the
high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this
work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data
from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of
the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral
correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from
the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the
range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates
to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between
$2.4\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\times10^{2} \rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\rm z} = 1 $
) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20
~M_{\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the
PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH
formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the
future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the
high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03785v1" target="_blank"><h2>Igniting galaxy formation in the post-reionization universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jorge Moreno, Coral Wheeler, Francisco J.

epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies.
Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing
satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume
cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments
(FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy
ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited
halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr) to halos that failed to form any
stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration
help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\%$
of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to
their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\%$ display
enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration
($c_{\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\sim17\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas
content and suppressed $c_{\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests
that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to
observationally catch this process `in the act' in the forseeable future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03978v1" target="_blank"><h2>SOFIA FEEDBACK Survey: The Eagle Nebula in [C II] and Molecular Lines</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ramsey L.

stars in the $\sim 10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ NGC 6611 cluster powering this H II

an expanding photodissociation region shell towards N19, and traces of a thin,
fragmented expanding shell towards M16. Our [C II] observations are resolved to
0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 15.5$^{\prime\prime}$ and analyzed alongside similarly
resolved CO J=3$-$2 observations as well as archival data ranging from the
radio to X-ray tracing a variety of gas phases spanning dense $\sim$10 K
molecular gas, $10^{4}$ K photoionized gas, and million-K collisionally ionized

NGC 6611 and the O9 V star within N19 to the surrounding gas. Winds from NGC
6611 have blown a 20 pc radius cavity constrained in size along the major axis
of the natal giant molecular filament, and much of the mechanical wind energy

younger than M16 by $\gtrsim 10^6$ yr, is driven by a combination of mechanical
wind energy and thermal pressure from photoionized gas and has swept up $\sim
10^{3}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ into neutral atomic and molecular shells.</p></br></body>
