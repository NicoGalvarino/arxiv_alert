Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $σ$ allows for the coupling $N S σ$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\rightarrow Sσ$), and (ii) for $T_{\rm EW}<T_{\rm rh}\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $σ-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\langleσ\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $σ-h$ coupling is small, then $σ$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($σ\rightarrow Sν$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21627v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence For A Correlation Between Astrophysical Neutrinos and Radio Flares</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yjan A.

We find an excess number of associations between flaring radio sources and neutrinos that were detected between the first and second VLASS observations at $>2σ$ confidence. This excess is consistent with radio flares contributing $\sim13\,\%$ of the astrophysical neutrinos observed by IceCube. Notably $>80\,\%$ of the radio flares associated with neutrinos are not detected at either $γ$-ray or X-ray wavelengths, highlighting the importance of radio observations for identifying potential electromagnetic counterparts to astrophysical neutrinos. No excess in the number of associations between the wider radio-variable population and the IceCube neutrinos is seen when no time constraint is placed on the neutrino detection. We predict that data from future VLASS epochs will see an excess number of associations between radio flares and neutrinos at the $>3σ$ level, and expected improvements to the positional constraints on the neutrinos may increase that confidence to $>5σ$, should our results be representative.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21618v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Super-Eddington, Lensing-Magnified Quasar at $z=5.07$ observed with JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Katherine Panebianco, Minghao Yue, Anna-Christina Eilers, Xiaohui Fan, Feige Wang, Jinyi Yang, Robert A.

Existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging does not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine whether the background quasar is multiply imaged. Exploiting the sharp PSF of the F070W band, we confirm that the background quasar can be well-described by a single point spread function (PSF), essentially ruling out the existence of multiple lensed images. We do not detect the quasar host galaxy in either the F070W or the F480M band. Using the HST and JWST photometry, we fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the foreground galaxy. The estimated mass ($\log(M_{*} / M_{\odot}) = 11.15 \pm 0.16$) and redshift ($z_{\text{phot}} = 3.62_{-0.04}^{+0.06}$) of the foreground galaxy are consistent with a single-image lensing model. We estimate the maximum possible magnification of the quasar to be $μ_{\text{max}} = 3.2$, which implies that the intrinsic Eddington ratio of the quasar is at least $λ_{\text{Edd}}^{\text{intrinsic}} > 4.9$. Therefore, J0025-0145 has one of the highest Eddington ratios among $z>5$ supermassive black holes known so far, suggesting the viability of super-Eddington growth for supermassive black holes in the early universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21585v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large-Scale Galaxy Correlations from the DESI First Data Release</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Francesco Sylos Labini, Tibor Antal<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages 12 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We quantify galaxy correlations using two distinct three-dimensional samples from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI): the Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) and the Luminous Red Galaxy Sample (LRGS). Specifically, we measure the conditional average density, defined as the average density of galaxies observed around a typical galaxy in the sample. To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\langle n(r) \rangle \propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \sim 400$~\text{Mpc}/$h$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21567v1" target="_blank"><h2>Enhanced antineutrino emission from $β$ decay in core-collapse supernovae with self-consistent weak decay rates</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> T.

Despite their importance, most studies to date on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have focused primarily on the effects of electron captures, generally neglecting $β$ decay contributions. In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $β$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $β$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $β$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21512v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime.

However, observational measurements of this `burst mass fraction' are scant. Here, we assemble a large (~14,000) sample of post-coalescence galaxies that have recently completed their merger-induced star formation, and compare various measurements of central stellar mass with a matched control sample. Specifically, we quantify (at fixed redshift, star formation rate and total stellar mass) the stellar mass enhancement within a fixed angular aperture (Delta M_{star,fibre}) and in the galactic bulge (Delta M_{star,bulge}), finding burst mass fractions of 10 -- 20 %. 61 galaxies in our sample are at z<0.05 and have integral field unit data from the Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) survey, allowing further kpc-scale assessment of excess stellar mass and radial gradients. Again, we find a ~15 -- 20 % excess of stellar mass in the central regions of the post-mergers compared with matched controls. However, contrary to previous works, which have inferred very compact, centralized merger-induced mass growth, we find a 15 % stellar mass excess out to ~7 kpc (1.4 R_e for the stellar masses in our sample). Our work represents the first direct measurement of merger-induced stellar mass that is independent of stellar population modelling, or fitting light profiles, demonstrating significant and extended mass build-up in late stage post-mergers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21501v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Feasibility of Using Fe XXIII Metastable Transitions as a Density Diagnostic for LMXB Disk Winds</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> D.

Studying these outflows can inform the understanding of the geometry of the systems, as well as the dynamics and energetics of accretion. One key variable for determining the location of these disk winds is the density of the outflowing material. In this paper we explore a density diagnostic based upon the absorption of ionizing photons by density-sensitive metastable states of Fe XXIII. This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX~13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission. For each of these, we find that the regime where Fe XXIII can be used as a density diagnostic is with an ionization parameter $\log{(ξ/{\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})}\sim2-3$ and an outflow density $\log{(n_H/{\rm cm^{-3})}}\gtrsim14$. The typical range of ionization parameters for LMXBs indicates that this technique is more feasibly achieved with BH LMXBs than their NS counterparts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21499v1" target="_blank"><h2>The relativistic tidal tensor: general solutions for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes and the Hills mass of naked singularities</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Wenkang Xin, Andrew Mummery<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 7 figures.

Resubmitted after review to PRD<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21479v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scalable and Robust Multiband Modeling of AGN Light Curves in Rubin-LSST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Weixiang Yu, John J.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor tens of millions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for a period of 10 years with an average cadence of 3 days in six broad photometric bands. This unprecedented dataset will enable robust characterizations of AGN UV/optical variability across a wide range of AGN physical properties. However, existing tools for modeling AGN light curves are not yet capable of fully leveraging the volume, cadence, and multiband nature of LSST data. We present EzTaoX, a scalable light curve modeling tool designed to take advantage of LSST's multiband observations to simultaneously characterize AGN UV/optical stochastic variability and measure interband time delays. EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of $\sim 10^2-10^4 \times$ on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST -- both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields -- thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries. In addition, EzTaoX's multiband capability allows robust characterization of AGN stochastic variability down to hourly timescales, facilitating the identification of accreting low-mass AGNs -- such as those residing in dwarf galaxies -- through their distinctive variability signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21468v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing modified gravity with 3x2pt analyses in galaxy mocks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marc Alemany-Gotor, Cristian Viglione, Pablo Fosalba, Isaac Tutusaus<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract), halo (abstract), haloes (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stage-IV surveys will enable unprecedented tests of gravity on cosmological scales. However, assuming General Relativity in the analysis of large-scale structure could introduce systematic biases if gravity deviates from GR at these scales. Modified gravity theories, such as the Hu-Sawicki formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, offer an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant, while remaining consistent with Solar System tests through screening mechanisms. In this work, we quantify the cosmological parameter biases that arise when using a combination of galaxy clustering and weak-lensing data-vectors, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, from an $f(R)$ galaxy mock under the incorrect assumption of GR, using for the first time high-fidelity full-sky galaxy mock catalogues. We employ a pair of twin simulations: one with GR and one with Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$. The mocks are built using an HOD method to populate the dark matter haloes with galaxies, calibrated against SDSS observations at low redshift. Using conservative scale cuts to minimise modelling uncertainties, we perform 3x2pt analyses and infer cosmological parameters through nested sampling, validating our pipeline with the GR mock. Our results show that when analysing the $f(R)$ galaxy mock assuming GR, the recovered cosmological parameters are very significantly biased, even when considering conservative scale cuts: the Figure of Bias reaches $\sim12σ$ for both $\{Ω_{\rm m}, σ_8\}$ and $S_8$. These biases persist even when marginalising over the galaxy bias and baryonic feedback, demonstrating that nuisance parameters cannot absorb the effects of modified gravity. We conclude that incorrectly assuming GR in a universe governed by $f(R)$ gravity leads to severe and detectable biases in cosmological inference for Stage-IV surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21463v1" target="_blank"><h2>Compton-induced $γ$-ray Cascade Emissions in Radio Galaxy NGC 1275</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mfuphi Ntshatsha, Markus Böttcher, Soebur Razzaque<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, conference<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Among active galactic nuclei (AGNi), blazars are the brightest emitters of high-energy (HE, $E \geq 100$ MeV) to very-high-energy (VHE, $E \geq 100$ GeV) $γ$-rays from their jets. Radio galaxies, being the misaligned parent population of the blazar class, were historically not detected at these frequencies.

The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds. While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $γ$-ray detectability threshold. In this paper, we propose a magnetar as the central engine of GRB 250114A by fitting the X-ray light curve, and infer a magnetic field strength $B_{\rm p}=13.24^{+1.73}_{-5.84} \, \times10^{15}\ \mathrm{G}$ and an initial spin period $P_{0}=14.31^{+0.93}_{-3.16} \, \mathrm{ms}$ of magnetar, with a jet correction, fall within a reasonable range.

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $δN$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21362v1" target="_blank"><h2>Weak gravity at micron scales from dark bubble cosmology and its cosmological consequences</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ulf Danielsson, Suvendu Giri<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-th, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16+1 pages<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future.

Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $Ω_c \approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant.

Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}=10^{42.31\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21190v1" target="_blank"><h2>Molybdenum and ruthenium in the Galactic disk: A closer look at their nucleosynthesis components</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tamara Mishenina, Teresa Kurtukian-Nieto, Tatiana Gorbaneva, Anish M.

Studying their abundances provides valuable insights into nucleosynthesis processes and the broader evolution of neutron-capture elements. We presented new observations of Mo and Ru, together with nearby neutron-capture elements strontium (Sr) and zirconium (Zr) for a new sample of 154 giant stars, located in the Galactic disk with metallicities -1 < [Fe/H] < +0.3. The abundances were determined under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium by fitting synthetic spectra. The abundances of Mo were derived from the Mo I lines at 5506 and 5533 A, the abundances of Ru were determined from Ru I lines at 4584, and 4757 A. For most of the giant stars observed in this work, Mo and Ru abundances were determined for the first time. We compare our observations with the signatures from different nucleosynthesis processes. Both the [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] in our stars show a decreasing trend with respect to increasing [Fe/H]. This pattern is similar to that of [Zr/Fe], whereas [Sr/Fe] exhibits a relatively flat trend with metallicity. Compared to the s-process ratios, all stars show a lower [Zr/Mo] and a higher [Ru/Mo], as expected from classical nucleosynthesis. Still, it is unclear if additional contributions from neutrino-wind components or the i-process is needed to explain the observed scatter of [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] in the Milky Way disk. Indeed, such a dispersion is consistent with the variations also seen in r-II stars at low metallicity and could therefore result from the combined contributions of r-process and s-process to galactic chemical evolution. The observed [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] scatter in r-II stars should be constrained by future investigations to define if any contributions of additional nucleosynthesis components are needed.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21187v1" target="_blank"><h2>Molecular Gas and Star Formation in Dwarf Galaxies Observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kijeong Yim, Soo-Chang Rey<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), molecular gas (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a spatially resolved analysis of the molecular star formation law (SFL) and gravitational instability in a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies (NGC 1035, NGC 4310, NGC 4451, NGC 4701, NGC 5692, and NGC 6106), using high-resolution $^{12}$CO ($J=1\rightarrow0$) data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We estimate the star formation rate (SFR) by combining the Galaxy Evolution Explorer near-ultraviolet and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 12 $μ$m imaging data to examine the relationship between molecular gas and SFR densities on scales of several hundred parsecs. We find that the power-law slope of the molecular SFL ranges from 0.62 to 1.08, with an average value of N$=0.81\pm0.18$, increasing to N$=0.87\pm0.05$ when excluding galaxies with poorly constrained CO data. These results are roughly consistent with values observed in massive spiral galaxies, suggesting a universal molecular SFL when analyzed with sufficient resolution and sensitivity. Radial profiles of the Toomre $Q$ parameter remain close to unity across the disks, with minimal radial variation, consistent with a self-regulated star formation model. Our results suggest that, despite their lower mass and metallicity, star formation in dwarf galaxies is governed by the same fundamental physical processes as in larger systems. This highlights the significance of high-resolution molecular gas observations in low-mass galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21182v1" target="_blank"><h2>Broad-band temporal and spectral study of TeV blazar TXS 0518+211</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Avik Kumar Das, Pankaj Kushwaha, Veeresh Singh, Goldy Ahuja, Deekshya R.

Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands. Overall, our study reveals several changes in the flux states and complex nature of jet dominated emission processes. In all the epochs, two-zone leptonic model provides a better description of the broad-band emission in this TeV BL Lac source.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21154v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of Cosmic Ray Distribution on the Growth and Saturation of Bell Instability</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Saikat Das, Siddhartha Gupta, Prateek Sharma<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, physics.plasm-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables; To be submitted; Comments are welcome!<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic rays (CRs) streaming in weakly magnetized plasmas can drive large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations via nonresonant streaming instability (NRSI), or Bell instability. Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21134v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing Bump in the Cosmological Power Spectrum Using Dwarf Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Maxim Zabelkin, Sergey Drozdov, Oleg Skorikov, Sergey Pilipenko<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyze the possibility of using observational data on nearby dwarf galaxies -- their luminosity functions and spatial distributions -- to constrain deviations of the cosmological power spectrum from the standard one.

Such a spectrum is motivated by observations of an excess number of galaxies at high redshifts. The bump leads to a noticeable increase in the luminosity function in the range $-13 > M_B > -17$ at $z=0$. Comparison with observations constrains the bump amplitude to $\mathcal{A} < 0.25$ at a 3-sigma significance level for a wavelength of 1.3~Mpc.

Traditional spectral line analysis relies heavily on manual intervention, which becomes impractical when handling the massive datasets produced by modern facilities like ALMA. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to automate spectral line fitting. Using observational data from ALMA, we train a neural network that maps both molecular spectroscopic data and observed spectra to physical parameters such as excitation temperature and column density. The neural network predictions can serve as initial estimates and be further refined using a local optimizer. Our method achieves consistent fitting results compared to global optimization with multiple runs, while reducing the number of forward modeling runs by an order of magnitude. We apply our method to pixel-level fitting for an observation of the G327.3-0.6 hot core and validate our results using XCLASS. We perform the fitting for CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$CN, and C$_2$H$_3$CN. For a 100 $\times$ 100 region covering 5 GHz bandwidth, the fitting process requires 4.9 to 41.9 minutes using a desktop with 16 cores and one consumer-grade GPU card.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20999v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): First Data Release Covering The D10 (COSMOS) Region</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> L.

The survey covers $\sim4.5$deg$^{2}$ over three extragalactic fields to Y$_{AB}<21.2$mag and probes sources at $0<z<1.2$, with a median redshift of $z=0.53$. Here we describe the DEVILS spectroscopic observations, data reduction and redshift analysis. We then describe and release to the community all DEVILS data in the 10h (D10, COSMOS) region including: i) catalogues of redshifts, photometry, SED fitting for physical properties, visual morphologies, structural decompositions and group environments/halo masses, ii) matched imaging in 28 bands from x-rays to radio continuum, and iii) reduced 1D spectra. All data are made publicly available through Data Central. Within D10 we obtain 5,442 new high-quality spectroscopic redshifts. When combined with existing, lower-quality, redshift information ($i.e.$ photometric redshifts) this is increased to 7,946. Of these, 3,122 have a spectroscopic redshift from another source (many that was not available at the time of the DEVILS observations). As such, DEVILS provides new unique high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for 4,824 faint sources in COSMOS. This increases the spectroscopic completeness at Y-mag$\sim$21 from $\sim$50% in other samples to $\sim$90% in DEVILS. Finally, we show the power of this dataset by exploring the suppression of star formation in over-dense environments, split by morphology and stellar mass, and highlighting the ubiquitous nature of environmental quenching.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20952v1" target="_blank"><h2>Oscillations of dark matter halos in galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> V.

Collisions of galaxies may create an offset between the centers of mass of these two components. Ignoring internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and Keplerian rotations of stars in the galaxy, we focus on possible relative oscillations of the visible matter in the dark matter halo. This two-fluid model is somewhat similar to the ``giant dipole resonances'' in nuclei. We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations. These matter -- dark matter oscillations may affect direction and magnitude of the dark matter wind coming to Earth.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20945v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Intermediate Mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri: Constraints on Accretion from JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Steven Chen, Jeremy Hare, Oleg Kargaltsev, Hui Yang, Denis Cioffi, Maximilian Häberle, Anil Seth<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyze JWST observations of the central region of the globular cluster $ω$ Centauri (NGC 5139, $ω$ Cen hereafter), around the position of the candidate IMBH inferred by Haberle et al. (2024a) from the motion of fast-moving stars in multi-epoch HST observations. We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses $\lesssim 20,000 M_{\odot}$. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20900v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping the Galaxy Color-Star Formation Rate Relation with Manifold Learning and Infrared Image Stacking</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yu-Heng Lin, Daniel Masters, Andreas L.

Galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) are difficult to estimate accurately without spectroscopic diagnostics or far-infrared (FIR) photometry, both of which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for large numbers of faint, high-redshift galaxies. Here we present the empirical relation between SFR and broadband optical-to-NIR colors learned from Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS/SPIRE imaging using an innovative stacking analysis that bins galaxies with similar optical-to-NIR spectral energy distributions using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Stacking based on optical-to-NIR colors ensures that our FIR stacks are built from galaxies with similar intrinsic physical properties as opposed to stacking simply by stellar mass. We train a 40$\times$40 SOM using 230,638 galaxies selected from the COSMOS field, and stack the mid-to-far infrared images from 24 micron to 500 micron. We are able to measure the median FIR luminosities from half of the SOM cells to calibrate the star formation rate. In addition to investigating the common structures of optical-to-NIR properties and FIR detections labeled on the SOM, we provide calibrated star formation rates for nearly half of the galaxies in the COSMOS fields down to $i-$band magnitude $\leq 25.5$, and present the evolution of the galaxy main sequence for low-mass galaxies to redshift $z\sim2.5$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20856v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid preparation.

We first survey the Euclid processing pipeline to identify all evident, potential sources of systematics, and classify them into two broad classes: angular systematics, which modulate the galaxy number density across the sky, and catastrophic redshift errors, which lead to interlopers in the galaxy sample. We then use simulated spectroscopic surveys to test our ability to mitigate angular systematics by constructing a random catalogue that represents the visibility mask of the survey; this is a dense set of intrinsically unclustered objects, subject to the same selection effects as the data catalogue. The construction of this random catalogue relies on a detection model, which gives the probability of reliably measuring the galaxy redshift as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of its emission lines. We demonstrate that, in the ideal case of a perfect knowledge of the visibility mask, the galaxy power spectrum in the presence of systematics is recovered, to within sub-percent accuracy, by convolving a theory power spectrum with a window function obtained from the random catalogue itself. In the case of only approximate knowledge of the visibility mask, we test the stability of power spectrum measurements and cosmological parameter posteriors by using perturbed versions of the random catalogue. We find that significant effects are limited to very large scales, and parameter estimation remains robust, with the most impacting effects being connected to the calibration of the detection model.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20847v1" target="_blank"><h2>Is there a retrograde accretion disk around 4U 1626$-$67?

Here an unscented Kalman filter is applied to track the $ν(t)$ fluctuations observed in 22.7 years (3340 samples) of publicly available Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope data to test the canonical picture of magnetocentrifugal accretion for consistency with prograde-prograde and retrograde-prograde accretion disk configurations on either side of the 2008 torque reversal.

We use 17 simulated low-mass galaxies from the Auriga Project ($\sim 3 \times 10^8 \, M_\odot \leq M_* \lesssim 2 \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$). We study the metallicity and the ages of these galaxies and their stellar halos, as well as the relation between these two properties. We find that all galaxies have negative radial [Fe/H] gradients, and that the centres of less massive dwarfs are generally more metal poor than those of more massive dwarfs. We find no correlation between the metallicity gradients and intrinsic galaxy properties, such as stellar mass or accreted stellar mass, suggesting that these gradients are not a simple byproduct of galaxy evolution in the low-mass regime. We also find that the dispersion in the mass-metallicity relation found in the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies can be explained with the infall time of their most dominant satellite: at a fixed accreted stellar halo mass, dwarf galaxies that accreted this satellite at later times have more metal-rich accreted stellar halos. Regarding the ages of the analysed galaxies, we find a prominent U-shape in the radial mean age profiles of $\sim 65\%$ of them, which is mainly driven by the in situ stellar material. This presence of a U-shape in the age profiles is due to the combination of the cessation of recent star formation at large radial distances and the merger events these galaxies undergo, which redistribute the stellar material to their outer regions. When focusing on the ages of the stellar halos, we find that more massive ones are older than less massive ones. Our results show a wide variety in ages and metallicities of low-mass galaxies and their stellar halos, reflecting the complex and non-uniform evolutionary pathways these systems can follow.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20775v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ashes of Creation: JWST Uncovers Silicate Dust in Massive Star Clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daniel Maschmann, Bradley C.

It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (> 105M$_{\odot}$) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10$μ$m, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10$μ$m emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (> 106M$_{\odot}$) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20761v1" target="_blank"><h2>Caustic crossings in giant arcs with extended dark matter objects</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Djuna Croon, Benedict Crossey, Jose Maria Diego, Bradley J.

While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size. We discuss the implications for current and future observations, which promise to deliver a statistical sample of caustic transients and correspondingly sharper constraints on dark objects.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20757v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 2.

Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($Λ$CDM+$M_ν$), spatial curvature ($oΛ$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\approx30\%$ and $\approx20\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\,{\rm eV}$, with the $30\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\,{\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\,{\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\,{\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20756v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-Order Photon Rings around Kerr Naked Singularities</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hina Suzuki, Yosuke Mizuno, Akhil Uniyal, Indu Kalpa Dihingia, Tintin Nguyen, Chi-kwan Chan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 3 figures, comments welcomed<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a detailed study of higher-order photon rings of an accreting Kerr naked singularity (KNS) with dimensionless spin parameter $a=1.01$; i.e., a horizonless, overly spinning compact object. Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20755v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Observations to Simulations: A Neural-Network Approach to Intracluster Medium Kinematics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> E.

Our goal is to constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) through a data-driven approach. We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity. Our results demonstrate that deep learning provides a powerful and objective framework for connecting X-ray observations to cosmological simulations, offering new insights into the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters and the mechanisms driving turbulence and bulk flows in the hot ICM.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20751v1" target="_blank"><h2>ECOGAL I.

Using the footprints of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we query and uniformly reprocess ALMA data to produce continuum images and two complementary source catalogues: (i) a prior-based catalogue anchored to optical/near-infrared detections, and (ii) a blind catalogue based on significant ALMA detections. Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning $0.0 < z < 15.0$. We identify 1288 detections (622 unique) with optical/NIR counterparts across the two methods, of which 832 detections (395 unique) appear in both. Among the 622 unique sources, 307 have spectroscopic redshifts from $0.12 < z < 6.85$. ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by $A^3COSMOS$ and $A^3GOODS-S$ by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets.

We detected seven line emitters, one of which is [C\,{\sc ii}] at $z = 6.071$, four are CO at $z = 0.8$--1.1, and the remaining two are possibly CO or [C\,{\sc i}] within photometric redshift ranges. Three of the four CO emitters are multiple images of the same galaxy. Compared to previous line-emitter searches in ALMA deep fields, our sample probes molecular gas masses $\sim$1 dex below the lower bound, thanks to gravitational lensing (typically $μ\sim 4$, up to $\sim$30 in extreme cases). Most emitters are located in a region similar to normal star-forming galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus molecular gas mass plane. To reduce dependence on SFR and stellar mass, we analyzed the molecular gas fraction and depletion timescale as a function of distance from the star-formation main sequence. We found that most emitters broadly follow the scaling relations from previous studies, consistent within the intrinsic scatter. In addition, we serendipitously detected the CH $N = 1$, $J = 3/2 \rightarrow 1/2$ $Λ$-doublet transition from one CO emitter at $z = 1.142$, representing the first detection of CH from an individual galaxy at cosmological distances through a blind survey. The CH/CO column density ratio of $\sim$$10^{-4}$ is comparable to that of local AGN-host galaxies, suggesting that CH traces molecular gas associated with AGN activity, possibly irradiated by X-rays.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20746v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neural Deprojection of Galaxy Stellar Mass Profiles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\leq 5\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\leq z \leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20589v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence of an Energetic Magnetar Powering 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

A small portion of the ATCA data was previously used to determine a time delay and our result is consistent with the previous value, but with an uncertainty that is smaller by more than a factor of two. The long time-baseline of the monitoring reveals that the flux density ratio is smoothly varying on a time-scale of years, an effect which we attribute to millilensing by massive objects (>>1 M_sun) in the lensing galaxy. Image A is unpolarized in the VLA monitoring, but VLBI observations show that this is partly due to beam dilution by an unpolarized counter-jet that is only present in that image.

We present exact, closed-form solutions for steady-state resonant-line radiative transfer in "V-shaped" atomic networks, where a single ground state couples to multiple transitions. Starting from the full angle-dependent transfer equation, we generalize absorption and emission coefficients to an arbitrary number of lines, derive a modified Fokker-Planck expansion of the frequency-redistribution COLT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and find excellent agreement with the analytic predictions across a wide range of line separations, optical depths, and damping parameters, establishing our solutions as stringent validation benchmarks. For concrete applications related to the Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, we examine how fine-structure splitting and deuterium injection modify the emergent spectra, internal radiation field, and radiative force multiplier. We show that these effects leave previous conclusions about Lyman-alpha feedback in the early universe essentially unchanged. Even when direct observational diagnostics are subtle, our framework provides novel analytic and numerical insights into coupled resonance-line transport and facilitates progress in general modeling of multi-line radiative transfer in diverse astrophysical settings.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20542v1" target="_blank"><h2>H II regions and supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds: A pilot study with the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Moses O.

These processes may compress nearby regions, triggering further star formation, but the significance of triggered star formation across the Galactic disc is not well understood. This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L_radio/L_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20484v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of new N-emitters over a wide redshift range <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> I.

To better understand these enigmatic objects and provide new constraints on proposed scenarios, we have undertaken a systematic search for galaxies with UV emission lines of nitrogen. Using public JWST NIRSpec data, we have identified 45 N-emitters with robust NIII] or NIV] detections, including 4 previously known objects. We find N-emitters from redshift $z\sim 3-11$ among a broad diversity of galaxies, in terms of morphology, UV magnitude, stellar mass, SFR, metallicity, and rest-optical line strengths. The UV nitrogen lines show typical equivalent widths between $\sim 5-50$ Å. Carbon lines are generally fainter than the N lines. Using strong line calibrations established at high-redshift, we find metallicities $12+log(O/H)\sim 7.15-8.5$, including thus also high metallicities. The H$β$ equivalent width of N-emitters varies strongly, and sources with low EWs show clear signs of a Balmer break, indicative of composite stellar populations combining both young (< 10 Myr) stars responsible of the UV emission lines and an older population contributing to the rest-optical spectrum. Supersolar N/O ratios are found in all N-emitters. C/O abundances are comparable to those of galaxies at the same metallicity, and all N-emitters show high N/C ratios or lower limits ($\log(N/C) > 0.5$), independently of metallicity. The observed abundance ratios are compatible with ejecta from H-burning and do not show signs of Carbon enhancements, even at higher metallicities. Finally, we find that the fraction of N-emitters increases with redshift, and we quantify this evolution. Our study increases the sample of known N-emitters by a factor $\sim 3$, reveals a diversity of properties among N-emitters, and provides new constraints on their nature.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20739v1" target="_blank"><h2>Game Theory in Cosmology</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Oem Trivedi, Venkat Venkatsubramanian<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, cond-mat.stat-mech, gr-qc, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 32 pages with no figures, comments very welcome !<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20479v1" target="_blank"><h2>Molecular hydrogen in filaments at high Galactic latitudes <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> P.

Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption lines can be used to probe the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. Cold HI with a significant optical depth from the GASKAP-HI survey is found to be located predominantly if not exclusively within filamentary structures that can be identified as caustics with the Hessian operator. Most of these HI filaments (57%) are also observable in the far-infrared (FIR) and trace the orientation of magnetic field lines. Aims. We considered whether molecular hydrogen (H2) might also be preferentially associated with CNM filaments. Methods. We analyzed 241 H2 absorption lines against stars and determined whether the lines of sight intersected HI or FIR filaments. Using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) H2 data in the velocity range -50 < vLSR < 50 km/s, we traced 65 additional H2 lines for filamentary HI and FIR structures in velocity and probed the H2 absorption for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. For 305 out of 306 positions, the lines of sight with H2 absorption intersect HI filaments. In 120 cases, there is also evidence for a correlation with dusty FIR filaments. All of the 65 available sight lines with known velocities intersect HI filaments. In 64 cases, the H2 velocities are consistent with HI filament velocities. For FIR filaments, an agreement is found for only 13 out of 14 H2 absorption lines. Conclusions. For the majority of H2 absorption lines, there is evidence that H2 is associated with cold HI filaments. Evidence of an association with FIR filaments is less compelling. Confusion along the line of sight limits the detectability of FIR filaments. For a comparable degree of UV excitation in the disk and lower Galactic halo, the formation rate of H2 appears to be enhanced in HI filaments with increased CNM densities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20461v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chiral phonons in metal-organic frameworks as quantum sensors for the direct detection of dark matter <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marek Matas, Filip Krizek, Carl P.

The quasar 0954+556 at redshift of 0.903 is an intriguing source exhibiting an unusual radio jet structure with significantly different jet directions at kpc and pc scales. At kpc scales, images from the VLA exhibit a bright core, a linear jet extending 24 kpc to the northwest, and a discrete jet component 16 kpc to the northeast. At pc scales, images from the VLBA show a two-component structure with a projected separation of 360 pc in the north-south direction. The peculiar structure of 0954+556 might result from jet reorientation. Here, our aim was to investigate the possible mechanism via multiscale and multifrequency deep radio images. We performed VLA and VLBA observations of 0954+556. Together with some existing data in the NRAO data archive, we made multiple VLA images at 1.4-22 GHz and VLBA images at 1.7-43 GHz for various image analyses of the jet structure. We identified the location of the radio core at pc scales, detected the faint counter-jets at both pc and kpc scales for the first time, and revealed a diffuse emission region connecting pc and kpc scale forward jets. Our spectral index distribution and spectral aging analysis indicate that 0954+556 might undergo at least two episodes of jet activity during the current AGN phase. Moreover, pc scale polarization maps display a well-resolved spine-sheath polarization structure. It seems that the jet direction of 0954+556 changed significantly during intermittent jet activity. This may explain the different jet orientations and spectral ages observed from kpc to pc scales. The research provides a strong case that AGN jet direction might change rapidly on timescales of one million years.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20423v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of Simulation Box Size for Weak Lensing: Replication and Super-Sample Effects <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Akira Tokiwa, Adrian E.

Using two simulation suites -- one comprising large boxes ($3750\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) and another constructed by tiling small boxes ($625\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) -- we generate full-sky convergence maps and extract $10^\circ \times 10^\circ$ patches via a Fibonacci grid. We consider biases in the mean and covariance of the angular power spectrum, bispectrum (up to $\ell=3000$), PDF, peak/minima counts, and Minkowski functionals. By first identifying lines of sight that are impacted by replications, we find that replication causes a O$(10\%)$ bias in the PDF and Minkowski functionals, and a O$(1\%)$ bias in other summary statistics. Replication also causes a O$(10\%)$ bias in the covariances, increasing with source redshift and $\ell$, reaching $\sim25\%$ for $z_s=2.5$. We additionally show that replication leads to heavy biases (up to O$(100\%)$ at high redshift) when performing gnomonic projection on a patch that is centered along a direction of replication. We then identify the lines of sight that are minimally affected by replication, and use the corresponding patches to isolate and study super-sample effects, finding that, while the mean values agree to within $1\%$, the variances differ by O$(10\%)$ for $z_s\leq2.5$. We show that these effects remain in the presence of noise and smoothing scales typical of the DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, Euclid, and Roman surveys. We also discuss how these effects scale as a function of box size.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds ($10^3$ - $10^5$ Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end $10^45.5$ erg s$^-1$ (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr$^-1$ for BHs at z>=5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20337v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PLUTO Code on GPUs: A First Look at Eulerian MHD Methods <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marco Rossazza, Andrea Mignone, Matteo Bugli, Stefano Truzzi, Lubomir Riha, Tomas Panoc, Ondrej Vysocky, Nitin Shukla, Alessandro Romeo, Vittoria Berta<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> physics.plasm-ph, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present preliminary performance results of gPLUTO, the new GPU-optimized implementation of the PLUTO code for computational plasma astrophysics.

In this study, we examine how the data coverage influences the reliability of parameter estimation within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework. Using OJ 287, TXS 0506+056, and Mrk 421 as representative of the low-, intermediate- and high synchrotron peak classes (LSP, ISP and HSP), respectively, we generate synthetic SEDs based on their best-fit models and perform 1,000 fits for each of the 21 observational configurations per source type. Our analysis quantifies the coverage probability for all model parameters, such has the magnetic field strength and the electron luminosity, and reveals that different blazar subclasses exhibit distinct sensitivities to spectral gaps. For LSPs, a minimal dataset comprising optical/UV, X-ray, and GeV $γ$-ray bands is sufficient for robust parameter inference. In contrast, ISPs and HSPs require broader spectral coverage to constrain the physical parameters. For ISP, we find that reliable parameter recovery can be achieved with two different minimal band combinations: \textit{(i)} X-ray, high energy $γ$-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray data, or \textit{(ii)} optical/UV, X-ray, and high energy $γ$-ray data. For HSPs, the minimal configuration enabling reliable parameter recovery includes the optical/UV, X-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray bands. We discuss the role of very high energy $γ$-ray observations, showing that they significantly enhance parameter recovery for HSPs. Our results provide practical guidelines for designing optimized multi-wavelength observation campaigns and for assessing the robustness of SSC model inferences under incomplete spectral coverage.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20310v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Empirical to Physical Model: Direct Fits of Optically Thin Inverse Compton Scattering to Prompt GRB Spectra <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pragyan Pratim Bordoloi, Shubh Mittal, Shabnam Iyyani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 Figures, 2 Tables, submitted<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is commonly attributed to non-thermal radiation processes operating in the optically thin regions of a relativistic outflow. Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $Γ\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\%$-$20\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $δ\sim 1.8$. The derived Comptonisation parameters indicate moderate $y$ values ($\sim 1$-$3$), optical depths $τ\sim 0.2$-$0.6$, and dissipation radii just above the photosphere, consistent with mildly relativistic ($γ_{\min} \sim 1.2$-$2.6$), photon-dominated, low-magnetic-field dissipation environments. Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20300v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tails of Gravity: Persistence of Star Formation in the CMZ Environment <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Linjing Feng, Sihan Jiao, Fengwei Xu, Hauyu Baobab Liu, Xing Lu, Neal J.

Using multi-band continuum observations taken from ${\it Planck}$, ${\it Herschel}$, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and CSO/SHARC2, we derived 8.5" resolution column density maps for the CMZ clouds and evaluated the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). With the archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm dust continuum data, we further evaluated the mass of the most massive cores ($M_{\rm core}^{\rm ma x}$). We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$), $M_{\rm core}^{\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20267v1" target="_blank"><h2>Projection Effects in Barred Galaxies Causing Wrong Interpretation of Radial Flows <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> E.

It is important to estimate the outflows, due to AGN or supernovae feedback, or inflows due to bar gravity torques. However, these radial flows may be confused with non-circular motions, which are quite frequent in the center of galaxy disks. We use a simulated giant, barred spiral galaxy from the GalMer database to study the non-circular motions induced by the bar. Our goal is to identify the spurious radial flows that kinematics modeling algorithms can detect, assuming circular orbits for the gas. Using mock data of a strongly barred galaxy, we quantify the radial velocities computed by the 3D-Barolo algorithm for different disk inclinations and several bar orientations in the plane of the sky: along the major and minor kinematic axes and at 45° from them. Our results show that projection effects cause kinematics modeling algorithms to confuse the radial component of velocity due to elliptical orbits with significant radial flows with mean values up to 84 km.s$^{-1}$, within the bar region. The computed rotation curve is also wrongly estimated inside the bar region, by as much as 150 km.s$^{-1}$ for the highest inclination.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20231v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating the Stellar Bycatch: Constraining the Prevalence of Extraterrestrial Transmitters within Radio SETI Surveys <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Louisa A.

It is important to account for the complete stellar population captured within a radio telescope's field of view, or stellar 'bycatch'. In recent years, catalogues from ESA's Gaia mission have enabled SETI surveys to place tighter limits on extraterrestrial transmitter statistics. However, Gaia remains restricted by magnitude limits, astrometric uncertainty at large distances, and confusion in crowded regions. To address these limitations, we investigate the use of the Besançon Galactic Model to simulate the statistical underlying stellar population to derive more realistic constraints on the occurrence of extraterrestrial transmitters. We apply this method to Breakthrough Listen's Enriquez/Price survey, modelling 6,182,364 stellar objects within 1229 individual pointings and extending the search out to distances $\leq 25$kpc. We place limits on the prevalence of high duty cycle transmitters within 2.5kpc, suggesting $\leq (0.000995 \pm 0.000002)\%$ of stellar systems contain such a transmitter (for near-zero drift rates and EIRP$_{\mathrm{min}} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{16}$W). In support of broader adoption, we provide a simple calculator tool that enables other researchers to incorporate this approach into their own SETI analyses. Our results enable a more complete statistical estimation of the number and stellar type of systems probed, thereby strengthening constraints on technosignature prevalence and guiding the analysis of future SETI efforts. We also conclude that SETI surveys are, in fact, much less biased by anthropocentric assumptions than is often suggested.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20188v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Evolving Baryonic Tully Fisher Relation: A Universal Law from Galaxies to Galactic Clusters <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Stuart Marongwe, Stuart Kauffman<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) links the baryonic mass of galaxies to their characteristic rotational velocity and has been shown to with remarkable precision across a wide mass range. Recent studies, however, indicate that galaxy clusters occupy a parallel but offset relation, raising questions about the universality of the BTFR. Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs. Our results unify mass-velocity scaling across five orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, offering new insights into cosmic structure formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20184v1" target="_blank"><h2>Search for the potential electromagnetic counterparts of neutrino events in SDSS galaxies at z<0.1 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> O.

Such observations are essential for constraining source localization, determining the source type, and understanding emission mechanisms. Typically, they require following up a neutrino alert (IceCube issues two alert streams: Gold, with at least 50 percent probability of astrophysical origin, and Bronze, with at least 30 percent probability) with an electromagnetic facility, primarily in X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Another approach involves electromagnetic monitoring of hot spots in the IceCube skymap, i.e., positions exceeding the instrument sensitivity. An alternative method consists in performing correlation analysis across available neutrino events and source catalogs. We searched for spatial coincidence between galaxies from SDSS and high-energy neutrino events. The analysis includes IceCube Gold alerts and neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events from AMON (Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network), identified through the end of September 2025. We examined galaxies from the morphological catalog at redshifts 0.02 to 0.1, which contains 315,776 SDSS DR9 objects with absolute stellar magnitudes in the range from -24 to -13 in the r band. Among 59 IceCube Gold alerts, we found three with only one galaxy (SDSS J231231.52+033415.1) within the 50 percent containment radius. Among 24 neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events, three more contain only one galaxy (SDSS J220711.14+122535.9) within the same radius. These six galaxies represent the most promising candidates for potential host galaxies of neutrino sources.

At fixed halo mass, we find a clear positive correlation between stellar mass and halo concentration, particularly in low-mass haloes between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}\,\rm M_\odot$, where all halo properties are computed from the corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20112v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially Resolved Plasma Diagnostics of the Supernova Remnant DEM L71 using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuki Amano, Yuken Ohshiro, Hiromasa Suzuki, Kotaro Fukushima, Hiroya Yamaguchi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in PASJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a spatially resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the supernova remnant DEM L71 using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) aboard XMM-Newton. Because of the large dispersion angle of the RGS, we are able to resolve individual emission lines and examine their spatial distributions within this moderately extended remnant. We derive line fluxes across different regions of DEM L71 and perform quantitative plasma diagnostics. Our analysis reveals that some regions have high forbidden-to-resonance ratios of O\emissiontype{VII} He$α$ lines, suggesting a non-negligible contribution from additional physical processes, such as charge exchange and/or resonance scattering. Our results demonstrate that the RGS has potential to serve as an outstanding X-ray imaging spectrometer for moderately diffuse objects.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 58 papers (37 new, 21 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
