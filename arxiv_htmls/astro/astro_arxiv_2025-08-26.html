and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive
galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive
galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei
(AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions.
We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential
and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is
most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while
maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy,
partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$)
energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a
larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic
MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised
AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within
$r < 15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within
$r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well
and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for
both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism
remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within
$r < 1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential
well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism
cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution
is similar to the multiphase galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18097v1" target="_blank"><h2>A$^3$COSMOS: The dust content of massive quiescent galaxies and its

quiescent galaxies (QGs) at redshift $z=0.5-3$ to place constraints on the
evolution of their cold interstellar medium (ISM), and thereby obtain insights
on the processes of galaxy quenching throughout cosmic time. We use a robust
sample of 458 colour-selected QGs covered by the A$^3$COSMOS+A$^3$GOODSS
database to perform a stacking analysis in the $uv$-domain and measure their
mean dust masses from their stacked submillimetre luminosities. We use the
CIGALE SED-fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time
since quenching for all QGs in our sample. We use this information to gain
insight on the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in
our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of
cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z>1$ are recently
quenched (i.e., quenched for no longer than $500\,$Myr), whereas the majority
of QGs observed at $z < 1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of
time ($\gtrsim1\,$Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$)
are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM,
while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term
effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust
mass fraction of the QG population, pointing towards lower dust content in
high-redshift massive QGs than found by earlier stacking studies, and
significantly lower (by a factor $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star forming
galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after
quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600\,$Myr after quenching, QGs
already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM. Our findings support a
gas consumption or removal scenario acting on short timescales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16971v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Multiphase Galactic Outflows: A Multifluid Moving Mesh Approach</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Francesco Bollati, Rainer Weinberger</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), outflows (title, abstract), outflow (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Outflows are a key part of the galactic gas cycle and crucial in shaping the
star formation activity in their host galaxy. Yet, in simulations of galaxy
evolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the
relevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for
simulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively
low-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological
simulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its
interaction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing
drag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms
for single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent
with high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst
galaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates
of high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold
outflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold
interstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the
acceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties:
stronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot
phase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the
origin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas
mostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to
substantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables
efficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key
multi-component features of the outflow dynamics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16795v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the Variability Features of Active Galactic Nuclei in Little Red Dots</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shuying Zhou, Mouyuan Sun, Zijian Zhang, Jie Chen, Luis C.

distributions (SEDs), known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), are discovered by the
James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. The nature of LRDs is
controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through
variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD
variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here,
we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is
motivated by accretion physics and applicable to reproduce AGN conventional
variability, to study the variability of $22$ LRDs in \citet{Tee2025}. Our
results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by
measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in
LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute $\lesssim30\%$
of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use
simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively
investigate LRDs via variability: first, a sample of about $200$ LRDs; second,
each LRD has two observations separated by at least two years in the observed
frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is $\leq 0.07$ mag. If the LRDs still
lack variability under these conditions, the time-domain study would provide
independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from
low-redshift quasars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17733v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGNs in the extremely overdense galaxy region BOSS 1441: A Chandra
  observation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiahua Wu, Liming Dou, Zheng Cai, Yanli Ai, Shiwu Zhang, Zhenya Zheng, Xiaohui Fan, Yuanyuan Su, Jianfeng Wu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a Chandra/ACIS-I study of X-ray sources in BOSS 1441, a
protocluster at $z=2.32\pm0.02$ that exhibits a prominent overdensity of
Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). Using a 45 ks observation, we identify seven X-ray
sources spatially coincident with LAE density peaks. The average X-ray photon
index for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with
Galactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from -0.68 to 2.51), corresponding
to an average luminosity of $\rm 6.85\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$ in the
rest-frame 2-33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning $(3.57 -
13.96)\rm\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$. Three sources exhibit relatively flat
spectral slopes. Two are associated with the MAMMOTH-1 nebula, while the third,
located at the edge of BOSS 1441 with a $> 5'$ offset from the LAE density
peak, resides in a region with a high submillimeter-band density. We estimate
the fraction of X-ray detected AGNs among the LAEs to be
$11.5^{+3.8}_{-4.6}\%$, approximately double that of previously studied LAEs.
This elevated fraction suggests BOSS 1441 is in a mature evolutionary stage,
with even higher AGN fractions expected in massive LAEs such as PKS 1138-262.
In contrast, the submillimeter galaxy population shows a lower AGN fraction
($6.9^{+6.9}_{-4.5}\%$), consistent with their typically obscured nature. These
results indicate that the protocluster's massive galaxies are evolving into the
bright red sequence galaxies observed in local clusters, where AGNs likely play
a critical role in quenching their star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18160v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shocks and complex chemodynamics in the metal-poor starburst galaxy CGCG

chemodynamical analysis of the most luminous star-forming region within the
metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. Leveraging the exceptional high
resolution (R$\sim$50,000) and broad wavelength coverage, we apply Bayesian
inference to simultaneously model the fluxes of 30 emission lines spanning the
wavelength range 3400-9200\AA. Employing a two-region ionisation model, we
characterise various gas properties including electron temperature, electron
density, and chemical abundances across different elements. Our direct-method
inferred metallicity yields $\rm 12+\log(O/H)=7.77\pm0.03$, placing the galaxy
in the metal-poor regime. Furthermore, Metal-to-Oxygen ratios such as log(S/O),
log(Ne/O) or log(Ar/O) are in full agreement with the values derived for the
Milky Way, consistent with expectations from stellar evolutionary models. The
brightest emission lines are kinematically complex, with modelling requiring up
to four distinct components. The exceptional resolution and signal-to-noise
ratio of the data unveil asymmetric and wide ($\sigma_{HeII} \approx$ 35km/s)
HeII$\lambda$4686 emission. The flux ratio of this nebular line, together with
the absence of other high ionisation species such as [NeV]$\lambda$3426,
indicates the presence of fast radiative shocks. This dataset underscores the

supernova (SN) remnant, they penetrate behind the shock front, where they are
heated and destroyed in the hot gas. This leads to a change in emissivity of
such grains. In this work, we consider the evolution of the infrared (IR)
luminosity of the SN remnant expanding into an inhomogeneous interstellar
medium with lognormal distribution of the density fluctuations. The IR
luminosity of the swept-up interstellar dust rapidly increases during the first
several thousand years after the SN explosion, and reaches the maximum value.
Afterwards, it decreases due to the destruction of the dust grains in hot gas
and their declining emissivity in the cooling down gas of the shell. We show
how the IR luminosity of dust in the SN remnant depends on the dispersion of
the gas density in front of the SN shock front. We find that for the
significant period of time (40 - 50 kyr) the maximum of the dust IR luminosity
peaks at the range centered at 70$\mu$m. Therefore, this band can be considered
as the most optimal range for studying the late SN remnants. We illustrate that
during evolution, the dust temperature changes from 70 to 20 K, and only
slightly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. In the radiative phase,
the strong emission lines of metal ions emerge above the dust continuum. Their
luminosity rapidly increases and exceeds the dust continuum luminosity by $\sim
10-10^3$ times. The point in time when the high luminosity in the lines is
reached strongly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. We discuss
possibilities for detection of the IR emission both in dust continuum and in
lines. We expect that their ratios will allow to estimate the inhomogeneity of
the medium, where the remnant is expanding.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18061v1" target="_blank"><h2>Timing Mass of the Local Group</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Louis E.

cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of
massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores
the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the
mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and
contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing
mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates
for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses,
and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics
have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark
matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local
values of cosmological parameters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17293v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Jetted Wandering Massive Black Hole Candidate in a Dwarf Galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuanqi Liu, Tao An, Mar Mezcua, Yingkang Zhang, Ailing Wang, Jun Yang, Xiaopeng Cheng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in Science Bulletin</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Wandering massive black holes (MBHs) are thought to form through

unambiguous signatures of an accreting MBH: a brightness temperature exceeding
$10^9$K, a parsec-scale jet, and flux density variability over a 30-year

galaxies vary by galaxy type. In starbursts, a major contribution comes from
neutral pion decay. This is driven by interactions between interstellar gas and
hadronic cosmic rays (CRs), which are accelerated in strong shocks associated
star formation activity and stellar remnants. Leptonic $\gamma$-ray emission
can also arise from electrons directly energized in interstellar shocks,
produced via charged pion decays, or emitted by pulsars and their surrounding
halos. In quiescent galaxies, pulsars and their halos can represent a major
$\gamma$-ray source class, with millisecond pulsars predominantly located in
globular clusters (GCs) being particularly important. Recent detections of very
high-energy (VHE) emission from Galactic GCs suggests they may also contribute
to the TeV $\gamma$-ray flux from evolved galaxies. We consider a scenario
where this VHE emission from GCs is powered by electrons accelerated in
communal stellar/pulsar wind cluster termination shocks. These electrons
undergo inverse Compton scattering as they propagate into GC magnetotails. Our
results show that the high-energy emission from GCs can be an important
contributor to the GeV and TeV flux from massive, quiescent galaxies. The
relative strength of each component depends on the global galactic properties
and its evolutionary history.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16759v1" target="_blank"><h2>Energy-Space Analysis of Tidal Stripping in Stellar-Dark Matter Systems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bradley Arias, Nicole E.

stripping may play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of these galaxies,
yet the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using
idealized N-body simulations, we investigate the tidal evolution of
two-component systems -- stellar and dark matter -- embedded in a host
potential. We find that in terms of energy distributions, both stellar and dark
matter particles are stripped identically, regardless of their initial
profiles. This surprising result suggests that the energy distribution of
stripped stars can provide direct constraints on the underlying dark matter
structure. Furthermore, we show that systems with cored dark matter and cuspy
stellar profiles naturally evolve into dark matter-deficient (DMD) galaxies,
supporting tidal stripping as a viable DMD formation pathway. This energy-space
analysis of multi-component systems offers new insights into the dynamical
evolution of tidally stripped galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16951v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIDIS: Unveiling the Star Formation History in massive galaxies at

HST and JWST with low-resolution grism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRISS, obtained
as part of the MIDIS (MIRI Deep Imaging Survey) program. SFHs are derived
through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using two independent codes,
BAGPIPES and Synthesizer, under various SFH assumptions. This approach enables
a comprehensive assessment of the biases introduced by different modeling
choices. The inclusion of NIRISS spectroscopy, even with its low resolution,
significantly improves constraints on key physical parameters, such as the
mass-weighted stellar age ($t_M$) and formation redshift ($z_{\mathrm{form}}$),
by narrowing their posterior distributions. The massive galaxies in our sample
exhibit rapid stellar mass assembly, forming 50\% of their mass between $3 \leq
z \leq 9$. The highest inferred formation redshifts are compatible with
elevated star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon$) at early epochs.
Non-parametric SFHs generally imply an earlier and slower mass assembly
compared to parametric forms, highlighting the sensitivity of inferred
formation timescales to the chosen SFH model, particularly for galaxies at $z <
2$. Quiescent galaxies are, on average, older ($t_M \sim 1.1$ Gyr) and
assembled more rapidly at earlier times than their star-forming counterparts.
These findings support the ``downsizing'' scenario, in which more massive and
passive systems form earlier and more efficiently.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16854v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effects of Halo Anisotropy on Disc Galaxy Encounters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tatum M.

of orbital angular momentum to internal motions even before the galaxies reach
their first pericentre. Consequently, for a given initial orbit, the

the matter-energy interaction in some of the most extreme astrophysical
environments. Considering broad emission line blazars, i.e., flat spectrum
radio quasars (FSRQs), the dense photon fields surrounding the relativistic jet
can prohibit the particle population from accelerating to very high energies
and producing VHE radiation. They can also possibly make the environment opaque
for the VHE $\gamma$ rays due to $\gamma\gamma$ pair production, thus
explaining the paucity of VHE-detected FSRQs and non-detection of TeV radiation
($>$1 TeV) from them. Here we report, for the first time, a $>$7$\sigma$
detection of an FSRQ, S5 1027+74 ($z=0.123$), in the VHE band, including the
first ever detection of TeV emission from an object of this class, using the
Fermi Large Area Telescope observations. Its $\gamma$-ray spectrum covering the
100 MeV to 2 TeV band revealed a prominent spectral break with a flat, rising
shape above $\sim$10 GeV, a feature never detected from other VHE-detected
FSRQs. The radio-to-$\gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution of S5 1027+74
provides strong evidence of a third bump peaking at multi-TeV energies. These
enigmatic findings imply that FSRQ jets can accelerate particles to extremely
high energies and provide tantalizing clues about the complex radiative
environment of relativistic jets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16948v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxies and Black Holes in the First Billion Years</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Richard S Ellis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Lectures given at the 54th Saas-Fee Advanced Course of the Swiss Society of Astrophysics and Astronomy, January 2025; 65 pages, 61 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> I present written notes from three lectures given at the 54th Saas-Fee

persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter
clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative
cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a
phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly
degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)
parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical
expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by
cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent
datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck
and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide
significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although
indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a
distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark
sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in
the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered
more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The
resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially
alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a
sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which
is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates
that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the
observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more
comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17042v1" target="_blank"><h2>RedMaPPer Cluster Properties from Two-Dimensional Lensing Shear Maps in

properties-such as concentration, ellipticity, and mass centroid-encode
information about their formation and evolution. Concentration traces collapse
time and internal structure, while ellipticity and centroid offsets reflect
halo shape and dynamical state. Accurate characterization of these properties
improves mass estimates and tests dark matter models. Gravitational lensing,
which directly probes projected mass distributions, provides a powerful means
to constrain halo structure. We present a 2D weak-lensing analysis of 299
RedMaPPer clusters using shear measurements from the HSC-SSP first-year data
release. By fitting elliptical NFW models with mass priors from the RedMaPPer
cluster richness-mass relation, considering the priors helps us break the
mass-concentration degeneracy and tighten constraints on other parameters. The
derived concentration-mass relation exhibits a slightly steeper slope than
traditional weak-lensing power-law or upturn models, and agrees more closely
with the results from strong lensing selected halos. More massive and
lower-redshift clusters tend to have lower concentrations and appear more
spherical. The halo ellipticity distribution is characterized by
e=1-b/a=0.530+/-0.168, with a mean of <e>=0.505+/-0.007. We also detect a
bimodal distribution in the offsets between optical centers and mass centroids:
some halos are well-aligned with their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), while
others show significant displacements. These results highlight the power of 2D
weak-lensing modeling in probing halo morphology and in providing key inputs
for understanding and modeling systematic effects in stacked lensing analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16842v1" target="_blank"><h2>Magnetic Pressure Dominance Stabilizes AGN Disks Against Gravitational

the outer regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks against
gravitational instability (GI). However, the computational demands of testing
this hypothesis have prevented comprehensive study of this problem. Here, we
present results from a suite of 6 isothermal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
shearing box simulations, 3 initialized with strong magnetization
($\beta^{\rm{mid}}_{0} = p_{\rm{gas}} / p_{\rm{mag}} = 10^{2.5}$) and 3
initialized with weak magnetization ($\beta^{\rm mid}_{0} = 10^{4}$). For each
magnetization, we performed simulations with both strong ($Q_{0} = 1.0$) and
weak ($Q_{0} = 10.0$) self-gravity, where $Q_{0} = \frac{c_{\rm{s}}\Omega}{\pi
G \Sigma_{0}}$ is the Toomre stability parameter; we also performed pure MHD
simulations for comparison. We find that our strongly magnetized disk
stabilized against GI after initialization to critical stability against GI,
while our corresponding weakly magnetized disk did not. We show that the
strongly magnetized, strongly self-gravitating disk became dominated by
magnetic pressure, which led to its stabilization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17848v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining deviations from $Λ$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yupeng Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 1 figure, and 1 table. Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> (abridged)We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation
of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario. The specific form of
this model is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m,
z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three forms of $\delta(z)$: model I,
$\delta(z)=\delta_c$; model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and model III,
$\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant
value. To constrain the models, we utilize a comprehensive set of observational
data, including DESI BAO, CMB, CC, SNIa data, and the $H_0$ measured by the
SH0ES. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to
take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive
values in model III. Our analysis further discloses that for model I, in which
the deviation parameter is redshift-independent, there is a notable 2$\sigma$
deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering the combined datasets of
DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES. However, this deviation decreases to less than $2\sigma$
once SNIa datasets are included. In contrast, model II remains consistent with
the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. Model III
exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding
$2\sigma$ and reaching $3\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The Akaike
Information Criterion indicates that models I and II are consistent with the
$\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being substantially disfavored
for the combined datasets DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES+DESY5. These results suggest
that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM
prediction-a conclusion that aligns with various studies on dark energy,
wherein dynamic dark energy is often favored over a cosmological constant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18053v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating Optical and Ring-Down Gravitational Wave Properties of a

rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter
halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe
realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen
solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like
axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and
the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically
investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo
radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the
null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the
presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion,
and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow.
Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations,
we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the
frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the
halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter
environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and
gravitational wave observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16990v1" target="_blank"><h2>Score Matching on Large Geometric Graphs for Cosmology Generation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Diana-Alexandra Onutu, Yue Zhao, Joaquin Vanschoren, Vlado Menkovski</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations
but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and
adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to
$N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based
generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates
gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an
informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts
in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large
geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model
successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000
halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing
diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant
computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a
generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational

relation (Mbh-Mbulge) on the predictions for the gravitational wave background
(GWB). The observed GWB amplitude is 2-3 times higher than predicted by
astrophysically informed models which suggests the need to revise the
assumptions in those models. We compare a semi-analytic model's ability to
reproduce the observed GWB spectrum with a static versus evolving-amplitude
Mbh-Mbulge relation. We additionally consider the influence of the choice of
galaxy stellar mass function on the modeled GWB spectra. Our models are able to
reproduce the GWB amplitude with either a large number density of massive
galaxies or a positively evolving Mbh-Mbulge amplitude (i.e., the Mbh / Mbulge

not evolve, our models require a galaxy stellar mass function that implies an
undetected population of massive galaxies (Mstellar > 10^11 Msun at z > 1).
When the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude is allowed to evolve, we can model the GWB
spectrum with all fiducial values and an Mbh-Mbulge amplitude that evolves as

discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.
Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their
wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics
(WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform.
These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are
challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger
optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework
to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens
profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers
the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits.
Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will
enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide
a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic

Planck 2018 baseline, thereby placing conventional attractor-type inflationary
models such as Starobinsky $R^2$ and Higgs inflation under increasing tension
at the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ level. In this work, we examine quantum-corrected
$\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Introducing an
anomalous scaling parameter $\gamma$ to capture quantum corrections to the
effective potential, we derive analytic expressions for the inflationary
observables $n_s$ and $r$. Confronting these predictions with ACT, Planck, and
BAO+lensing constraints, we demonstrate that modest values of $\gamma$ can
raise $n_s$ into the ACT-preferred range while maintaining a strongly
suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio. For instance, with $N=60$ and $\gamma\simeq
0.006$, the model predicts $n_s\simeq 0.974$ and $r\simeq 0.007$, in excellent
agreement with current bounds. We further investigate preheating dynamics,
focusing on particle production via parametric resonance in quantum-corrected
$\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this scenario,
the inflaton $\phi$ couples to an additional scalar $\chi$ through an
interaction $g^{2}\phi^{2}\chi^{2}$. In Minkowski spacetime, the resonance
dynamics reduce to the Mathieu equation, and we find that broad resonance can
be readily achieved, leading to efficient particle production.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17231v1" target="_blank"><h2>Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shinji Tsujikawa</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 3 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with

coupled scalar field theory, a theory that contains minimal quantum corrections
of the single scalar field Lagrangian. We develop the theoretical framework in
the string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do
not treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The
theoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework
by using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making
the resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum
corrections contain two terms, a linear $\sim \mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term
$\sim \mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert
term, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert
gravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim
\lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer
be that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\frac{G}{\lambda}$ and hence gravity
can be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having
stronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects
a stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is
not prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is
that it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary
gravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of
the quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials,
such as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17654v1" target="_blank"><h2>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo

inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the
background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of
primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature
perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo
simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially
in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from
the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$
from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method
involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch
paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of
interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a
new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing
two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple
estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$,
the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to
avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a
parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just
an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an
approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of
interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation
