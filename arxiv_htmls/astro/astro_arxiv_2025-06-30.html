crucial for understanding how galaxies form and evolve, including the roles of
long-lived cool gas reservoirs, starburst and AGN driven outflows. We use
stacked Mg II absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars to study
the cool gas out to 9Mpc from massive quiescent, star-forming and
post-starburst galaxies with stellar masses
$\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{gal}}/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.4$ and $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim
0.8$ selected from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS
galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we observe a decline in absorption
strength indicating a decrease in cool gas content with increasing distance
from the galaxies, as well as decreasing star formation rate of the galaxies.
Beyond 1Mpc, this decline levels off to the same absorption strength in all
galaxy types, suggesting a transition from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to
the intergalactic medium (IGM) at approximately the virial radius of the host
dark matter haloes. We find that post-starburst galaxies, that have experienced
a recent burst of star formation that has rapidly quenched, exhibit
significantly stronger Mg II absorption within 1Mpc than star-forming or
quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Because post-starburst galaxies
are a potentially significant pathway for the formation of quiescent elliptical
galaxies, our results have wide reaching implications for understanding the
mechanisms involved in quenching star formation in galaxies. We speculate that
the excess cool gas absorption out to 1Mpc around post-starburst galaxies is
related to their observed high velocity ($\sim$1000\,km/s) cool gas outflows.
Thus, strong, short-lived bursts of star formation impact the CGM around
galaxies on Mpc distances and Gyr timescales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21749v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematic misalignment as a driver of black hole activity in galaxies

of gas across several orders of magnitude in physical scale until the gas
reaches the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy. This work
explores the role of kinematically misaligned gas in the fuelling of AGN in a
sample of 4769 local galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We investigate for the
first time the relative role of external interactions and the presence of
kinematic misalignment as mechanisms to explain the observed increase in AGN
fraction in galaxies with large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment ($>$45
degrees). Using a sample of galaxies with evidence of recent external
interactions we find that there is a significantly higher fraction of AGN in
those where a large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment is observed
(20$^{+6}_{-4}\%$) compared with 6.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\%$ in galaxies where no
kinematic misalignment is observed. We determine that gas to stellar
misalignment has an important role in the fraction of AGN observed, increasing
the AGN fraction beyond the potential effect of external interactions. This
result demonstrates the importance of misaligned structures to the fuelling of
supermassive black holes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21859v1" target="_blank"><h2>Decoding AGN Feedback with X-arithmetic: From Morphology to Physical

Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a key process in the evolution
of massive halos in the Universe. New observational information on feedback is
crucial for improving the implementation of the physics in numerical models. In
this work, we apply a novel image-manipulation technique, termed
'X-arithmetic', to a sample of 15 galaxy clusters and groups deeply observed
with Chandra. This technique decomposes perturbations in feedback-dominated
regions into images excluding either (1) weak shocks and sound waves, (2)
bubbles inflated by jets, or (3) cooling and slow gas motions (isobaric
perturbations), enabling efficient spatial identification of these features
without involving spectroscopic analysis. We confirm the nature of previously
(spectroscopically-)identified features and newly establish the origin of other
structures. We find that feedback produces multiple shocks in groups and
massive galaxies, but only one to two shocks in clusters. Prominent isobaric
structures are abundant around inner cavities in clusters, compared to almost
no such structures in groups. These differences suggest that feedback effects
are stronger in smaller-mass systems, possibly due to the shallower
gravitational potential of groups or more violent feedback. Follow-up
spectroscopy, guided by the X-arithmetic results, suggests that
earlier-identified "isothermal shocks" could be a mix of isobaric and adiabatic
structures. We applied X-arithmetic to galaxy cluster simulations,
demonstrating its straightforward application and future potential for testing
the feedback physics details in simulations. Our feasibility study shows that
imaging data from future X-ray observatories like AXIS will be ideal for
expanding X-arithmetic application to a larger sample of objects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21665v1" target="_blank"><h2>TDCOSMO XXIII. First spatially resolved kinematics of the lens galaxy

Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), kinematics (title, abstract), quasar (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Spatially resolved stellar kinematics has become a key ingredient in
time-delay cosmography to break the mass-sheet degeneracy in the mass profile
and, in turn, provide a precise constraint on the Hubble constant and other
cosmological parameters. In this paper, we present the first measurements of 2D
resolved stellar kinematics for the lens galaxy in the quadruply lensed quasar
system \lensname, using integral field spectroscopy from the JWST's
Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), marking the first such measurement
conducted with the JWST. In extracting robust kinematic measurements from this
first-of-its-kind dataset, we made methodological improvements both in the data
reduction and kinematic extraction. In our kinematic extraction procedure, we
performed joint modeling of the lens galaxy, the quasar, and its host galaxy's
contributions in the spectra to deblend the lens galaxy component and robustly
constrain its stellar kinematics. Our improved methodological frameworks are
released as software pipelines for future use: \textsc{squirrel} for extracting
stellar kinematics, and \textsc{RegalJumper} for JWST-NIRSpec data reduction,
incorporating additional artifact cleaning beyond the standard JWST pipeline.
We compared our measured stellar kinematics from the JWST NIRSpec with
previously obtained ground-based measurements from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager
integral field unit and find that the two datasets are statistically consistent
at a $\sim$1.1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our measured kinematics will be used
in a future study to improve the precision of the Hubble constant measurement.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21705v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGN with massive black holes have closer galactic neighbors:

Koss, I. del Moral-Castro, K. Oh, A. Peca, C. Ricci, F. Ricci, A. Rojas, M. Signorini</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The large-scale environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveal important
information on the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs).
Previous AGN clustering measurements using 2-point correlation functions have
hinted that AGN with massive black holes preferentially reside in denser cosmic
regions than AGN with less-massive SMBHs. At the same time, little to no
dependence on the accretion rate is found. However, the significance of such
trends have been limited. Here we present kth-nearest-neighbor (kNN) statistics
of 2MASS galaxies around AGN from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic survey. These
statistics have been shown to contribute additional higher-order clustering
information on the cosmic density field. By calculating the distances to the
nearest 7 galaxy neighbors in angular separation to each AGN within two
redshift ranges(0.01 < z < 0.03 and 0.03 < z < 0.06), we compare their
cumulative distribution functions to that of a randomly distributed sample to
show the sensitivity of this method to the clustering of AGN. We also split the
AGN into bins of bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio
(while controlling for redshift) to search for trends between kNN statistics
and fundamental AGN properties. We find that AGN with massive SMBHs have
significantly closer neighbors than AGN with less-massive SMBHs (at the 99.98%
confidence level), especially in our lower redshift range. We find less
significant trends with luminosity or Eddington ratio. By comparing our results
to empirical SMBH-galaxy-halo models implemented in N-body simulations, we show
that small-scale kNN trends with black hole mass may go beyond stellar mass
dependencies. This suggests that massive SMBHs in the local universe reside in
more massive dark matter halos and denser regions of the cosmic web, which may
indicate that environment is important for the growth of SMBHs.</p></br></body>
