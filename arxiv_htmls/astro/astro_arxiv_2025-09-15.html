simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning
cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared
emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly
magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas
tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN
is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by
almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from
the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses
silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads
to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation
structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent
extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated
scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge
substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the
central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine
in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results
suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase
early in their evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10271v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar populations of quasar host galaxies with MFICA decomposition</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sahyadri Devidatt Krishna, Vivienne Wild, Paul C.

black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy
population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this
co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host
galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain
the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are
difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce
Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra
and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying
MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar
Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per
cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the
green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11,
and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming,
green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\sim25$ per cent of
quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\pm1$ compared
to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation
histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of
post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and
a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive
post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our
results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced
starbursts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10255v1" target="_blank"><h2>The 21-cm signature of X-ray heated halos around galaxies during cosmic

Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven
winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the
intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will
be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a
warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such
systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and
provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star
formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for
a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the
photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D
ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra
for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect
of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would
require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a
bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected
noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the
21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star
formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems
clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the
surrounding gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10079v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA reveals diverse dust-to-gas mass ratios and quenching modes in old

to $z\sim3$ challenge the long-standing view that the interstellar medium
depletes rapidly once star formation ceases, raising key questions of whether
dust and gas co-evolve in QGs, and how their depletion links to stellar aging.
We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band~6
continuum and CO(3--2) observations of 17 QGs at $z\sim0.4$ in the COSMOS
field. Using the dust-to-molecular gas mass ratio ($\delta_{\rm DGR}$) as a key
diagnostic, we trace post-quenching evolution of the cold interstellar medium.
Our study triples the number of QGs with direct $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ estimates,
constraining 12 systems with stellar population ages of $\sim$5--10 Gyr. For
the first time, we show that $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ in QGs ranges from
$\sim8\times$ below to $\sim2.5\times$ above the canonical value of
$\delta_{\rm DGR}\sim1/100$. Despite uniformly low molecular gas fractions
(median $f_{\rm H_2}=M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}\sim4.1\%$), QGs follow diverse
evolutionary paths: about half exhibit rapid ($\sim700$ Myr) exponential dust
decline with age, while the rest show mild decline over $\gtrsim$2 Gyr,
maintaining elevated $\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$. Our results support
simulations predictions of dust and molecular gas evolving independently
post-quenching, without a preferred quenching mode. This challenges the use of
dust continuum as a $\rm H_2$ tracer, implying that quenching cannot be
robustly linked to interstellar medium conditions when relying solely on dust
or gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09768v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially Offset Active Galactic Nuclei in the Very Large Array Sky

Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black
holes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy
halos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how
the distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the
efficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in
low-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they
are accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN).
In this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN
candidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey
(VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio
source surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset
AGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass,
consistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos.
However, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses,
potentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The
offset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital
radius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate
of < 0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar
masses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value
assuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a
relatively low MBH seeding efficiency.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10117v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of stochastic star-formation histories and dust on selecting

galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent
galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are
highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to
quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts
the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the
physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED)
fitting, such as M*, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they
impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform
SED fitting for ~13000 galaxies at z < 6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20
optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH
prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For
each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and
dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the
number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and
main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M*, AV, and
stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice
of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This
number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to ~45% more QGCs).
This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M*.
We find a strong correlation between AV and M*, with massive galaxies (M*~10^11
M\odot) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems
(M*~10^9 M\odot), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption, ~13% of
QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV > 0.5) in support of recent JWST
studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10230v1" target="_blank"><h2>Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and

Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical
activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to
redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider
the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies:
stellar mass gap, $\Delta M^*_{14}$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray
centroid shift, $\left < w \right >$. In general, the median values of these
indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both
mass and redshift. We find $\left < w \right >$ to be the most reliable proxy,
while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Delta M^*_{14}$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback
model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter
density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively
(positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to
both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas
densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left < w \right >$,
but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when
stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas
density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to
what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas
density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property
could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09761v1" target="_blank"><h2>Double Trouble: Two spectroscopically confirmed low-mass quiescent

GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and
MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and
with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$,
GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies
spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive
($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that
COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation
($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1
formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation
($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z
overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while
COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights
the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary
processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By
modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass
quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z
"mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z>5$ quiescent
galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates
dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10455v1" target="_blank"><h2>Joint X-ray, kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and weak lensing measurements:

landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around
groups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect
profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by
galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses
($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\odot$) and redshifts ($0 < z < 1$), we find evidence of more
efficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most
state-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and
X-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$
hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce
pre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\times$
lower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $>8 \sigma$
discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and
therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark
matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled
and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful
but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements
form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a
more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent
simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are
critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas
expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09800v1" target="_blank"><h2>The invariance of group occupation across the cosmic web</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Vicente Izzo Dominguez, Facundo Rodriguez, Antonio D.

large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and
underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable
insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the
influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether
secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe
are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD
depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying
these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different
cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the
influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We
create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to
determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership.
Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as
maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies
with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments.
We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the
robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using
different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that
large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order
dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines
local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work
with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision
required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10175v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards Precision Cosmology With Improved PNLF Distances Using VLT-MUSE.

rely on the bright-end power-law cut-off magnitude ($M^*$), which is defined by
a number of the [OIII]$\lambda5007$-brightest planetary nebulae (PNe). In
early-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the
population is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star
evolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs
with known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the
PNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using
stellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation
history, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the
PNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of
the PNLF ($\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological
Simulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies.
The average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are
typically old ($9 <\mathrm{Age}< 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4
<\mathrm{[M/H]}< +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity
in these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation
between $\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages
of 2--10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with
intermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies.
We show that the presence of at least $\sim 2\%$ of stellar mass younger than
10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also
present observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in
ETGs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10133v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reionization in HESTIA: Studying reionization in the LG through zoom

the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites)
and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local
Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer
post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate
our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA
simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global
reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA
zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in
the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves
haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization
within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW
and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly
earlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from
large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive
feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit
only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their
present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends
around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before
reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest
stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09883v1" target="_blank"><h2>PeV particle acceleration and non-thermal emission in the `minimalist'

features two 'extended jets' (tens of pc long and a few pc wide) from which
polarized X-ray and very high energy radiation above 100 TeV is detected. Here
we present a model of very high energy particle acceleration in these extended
jets. In the `minimalist' model (discussed in Churazov, Khabibullin, and Bykov,
2024), a collimated outflow aligned with the rotation axis is propagating
through a more isotropic wind produced by the accretion disk. The observed
extended X-ray jets with bright knots in this model are associated with the
formation of strong recollimation MHD shocks after the collision of the
collimated outflow with the isotropic wind termination surface. The spectra of
electrons and protons up to PeV energies are simulated with a nonlinear Monte
Carlo model of diffusive shock acceleration with turbulent magnetic field
amplification. The overall efficiency of the jets power transfer to accelerated
protons in this model is above 10\% and about 0.5\% for electrons above 50 TeV.
The magnetic field amplification by Bell's instability due to the electric
current of cosmic rays escaping the accelerator produces highly anisotropic
magnetic turbulence in the shock downstream. This results in the polarized
synchrotron X-ray emission with the photon electric vector predominantly
transverse to the jet direction and the degree of polarization above 20\%. The
model is able to reproduce the observed spectra and intensity profiles of
non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission, which are both dominated by the

probe key observables such as strong lensing (SL) by galaxies and clusters. In
preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL
candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects
that can be used as a watch list of known systems. By cross-matching this
sample with photometric and spectroscopic catalogs, we construct two
value-added tables containing key parameters for SL analysis, including lens
and source redshifts and lens velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$. As a preparation
for Rubin, we generate image cutouts for these systems in existing wide-field
surveys with subarcsecond seeing, namely CFHTLens, CS82, RCSLens, KiDS, HSC,
DES, and DESI Legacy. This sample, dubbed the "Last Stand Before Rubin"
(LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to
selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms.
As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data,
combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and
non-relativistic bodies through $\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints
on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu
database, we present an independent test of $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct
from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test
exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images. By combining
these data with the previously published samples, we obtain the most stringent
constraint on $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Our results are consistent with GR at the
$\sim$~1-$\sigma$ level and with the previous results from the literature.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09133v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reprocessing of X-rays emission in Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Manish Kumar, Rahul Sharma, Biswajit Paul</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> With the discovery of pulsations in some of the ultra-luminous X-ray sources
(ULXs), it is quite clear that most of the ULXs harbor either a neutron star or
a stellar mass black hole as a compact object accreting at super-Eddington
rates. In spite of having such a high accretion rate, the reprocessed emission
in the ULX sources is quite meagre compared to that observed in Galactic X-ray
binaries, except for some absorption lines in the winds. In this work, we
investigate the extent of reprocessed emission in ULXs using three diagnostics:
(i) searches for Fe $\rm K\alpha$ lines in bright well-known ULXs and Ultra
luminous X-ray Pulsars (ULXPs), (ii) evolution of hardness ratio around the
eclipse transitions in the eclipsing ULXs, and (iii) the flux ratio between
eclipse and out-of-eclipse (OOE) phases in eclipsing ULXs. We placed the most
stringent constraints to date on the upper limits on EW of the iron line,
11--20 eV. Furthermore, we have not observed any significant changes in the
hardness ratio during the ingress or egress, while in Galactic eclipsing X-ray
binaries, an increase in the hardness ratio is observed during the transitions.
Finally, the reprocessing efficiency (eclipse to OOE flux ratio) is found to be
larger in ULXs compared to Galactic eclipsing X-ray binaries. Based on these
results, we discuss the possibility of a metal-poor or highly ionized
environment surrounding the ULXs, which suppresses reprocessed emission
features.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09902v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematics of the lens host S0 galaxy NGC 1553: role of secular

1553, to understand its origin and the underlying dynamical processes that
shape it. The high-resolution integral field spectroscopic data from the Multi
Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) reveal a well-ordered rotation pattern,
consisting of a rapidly rotating nuclear disc that is somewhat decoupled from
the main disc, together with an inner lens; we collectively refer to these
structures as the "disc-lens". The central peak in the velocity dispersion
indicates the presence of a classical bulge. The nuclear disc is dynamically
colder than the surrounding disc, while the lens is dynamically hotter. The
higher-order Gauss-Hermite moments, $h_{3}$ and $h_{4}$, further characterise
the stellar kinematics. An anti-correlation between the line-of-sight velocity
and skewness ($h_{3}$) is consistent with regular rotation. In contrast, the
ring-like enhancement in kurtosis ($h_{4}$) confirms the presence of the
nuclear disc component. Unsharp masking of HST images (Erwin et al. 2015)
reveals a nuclear bar and faint spiral structures within the central 10 arcsec,
supporting the role of secular evolution. The mass-weighted stellar age map
shows an old stellar population in the central regions, with high metallicity
that suggests the in-situ formation of the disc-lens from disc material. We
discuss possible formation scenarios for the disc-lens, including both minor
mergers and secular processes, and examine the influence of the Dorado group
environment on NGC 1553. Our findings suggest that the disc-lens in NGC 1553
formed during the early stages of the galaxy's evolution. However, its
subsequent development has been shaped by internal and external processes.
These results provide new insights into the origin and evolution of
kinematically distinct substructures in S0 galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09355v1" target="_blank"><h2>The History of Galaxy Mergers in IllustrisTNG</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bendeguz Koncz, Istvan Horvath, András Péter Joó, Andreas Burkert, L.

since there is a debate on the impact of galaxy collisions on the star
formation and metallicity. The local environment of the galaxy mergers could
also have a large impact on the evolution of the galaxies, but it has not yet
been possible to examine it in detail. Modern simulations with larger capacity,
including the newest physical knowledge and new observations with JWST, help us
to answer these questions. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we
processed the catalogue data and the merger tree files of the TNG300-1
simulation. We calculated the galaxies average star formation rate (SFR) and
mass at redshifts between 0 < z < 15. We investigated the environment of galaxy
mergers, with the focus on the local density, and also examined how the SFR
changes in merging galaxies. We compared our findings with JWST results and
highlighted differences in the star formation rate density (SFRD) history
between the models and observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10292v1" target="_blank"><h2>Is cosmic dust porous?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alexey Potapov, Martin R.

community as to the structure and morphology of dust grains in various
astrophysical environments (e.g., interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes,
protoplanetary and debris disks, and the atmospheres of exoplanets). Typical
grain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice
mantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely
to exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with
concomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain
surface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown
that this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several
physico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and
reactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a
particularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify
what is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess
the likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous
structural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an
astronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory
experiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various
astrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints
and perspectives on cosmic dust porosity. Overall, our paper discusses the
effects of including porosity in dust models and the need to use such models
for future astrophysical, astrochemical and astrobiological studies involving
surface or solid-state processes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10440v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- The star cluster systems of the

into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding
intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important
given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid
Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming
dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\star \sim$ (1--4)
$\times10^8 M_\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars
across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$
images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from
compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing
combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with
confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$,
$Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and
properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our
sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim
100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has
more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with
its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5
M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster
in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old,
extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we
identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have
high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling
relations at low luminosity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09417v2" target="_blank"><h2>LMC+: Large-scale mapping of [CII] and [OIII] in the LMC molecular

between the fueling of star formation via molecular gas and the feedback from
recently formed massive stars. This process, by which galaxies evolve, is also
closely connected to the intrinsic properties of the interstellar medium (ISM).
To study the role that different molecular and atomic phases of the ISM play in
star formation, and to characterize their physical conditions, we zoom into our
nearest neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 50 kpc). The LMC
offers a view of the ISM and star formation conditions in a low metallicity
environment similar to, in that regard, the epoch of the peak of star formation
in the earlier universe. We present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of a
well-known star-forming regions (SFRs) at a spatial resolution of a few pc. We
mapped a 610pcx260pc region in the LMC molecular ridge in [CII] and the [OIII]
using the FIFI-LS instrument on the SOFIA telescope. We compare the data with
the distribution of the CO (2-1) emission from ALMA, the modeled TIR luminosity
as well as Spitzer/MIPS continuum and Halpha. We also provide a detailed
description of the observing strategy and the data reduction. We find that
[CII] and [OIII] emission is associated with the SFRs in the molecular ridge,
but also extends throughout the mapped region, not obviously associated with
ongoing star formation. The CO emission is clumpier than the [CII] emission and
we find plentiful [CII] present where there is little CO emission, possibly
holding important implications for CO-dark gas. We find a clear trend of the
[CII]/TIR ratio decreasing with increasing TIR. This suggests a strong link
between the [CII]-deficit and the local physical conditions instead of global
properties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09643v2" target="_blank"><h2>Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuhao Guo, Zhen Zhong, Yifan Chen, Vitor Cardoso, Taishi Ikeda, Lihang Zhou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 5 figures, movie:this https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally

simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their
co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for
various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe
the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions,
demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization
fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early
stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission,
producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background.
Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary
eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09203v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Long-Wavelength Amorphous Dust Emission Based on the Physically

(SP) model, applicable in the long-wavelength range from the far-infrared to
the microwave. The SP model is widely accepted in material physics to explain
amorphous thermal properties and is an extension of the two-level systems (TLS)
model, which has been applied in interstellar amorphous dust physics. In the SP
model, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a
double-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric
interaction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of
the amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical
solutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these
results, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential
barrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed
spectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the
conventional TLS model. Additionally, the SP model can more effectively explain
various long-wavelength dust emission features, such as the spectrum flattening
in the submillimeter range and anomalous microwave emission (AME), compared to
the TLS model. Further comparison and verification with observational data and
laboratory measurements are necessary to refine the model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09576v1" target="_blank"><h2>Build-up and survival of the disc: From numerical models of galaxy

using a statistical suite of cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass
galaxies. Our results show that stellar kinematics at $z=0$ rarely recover the
true times of disc spin-up, due to the disruptive impact of massive radial
merger events. The proto-disc (i.e. Aurora) and kicked-up disc stars (the
Splash) become indistinguishable at low metallicities, and the local fraction
of kicked-up disc stars remains $< 20$ per cent even in the case of major
mergers. In contrast, observations from Gaia and legacy surveys reveal that
Galactic $\alpha$-rich populations as old as $\tau=13.5\,\rm{Gyr}$ show
significant rotation, with median $\eta > 0.75$. This places strong constraints
on the merger ratio between the proto-Milky Way and its last significant merger
(Gaia-Sausage Enceladus, GSE), favouring values of $\lesssim 1:7$. We present
the age-metallicity relation for the stellar halo and estimate the interaction
epoch at $\tau_{\rm{spin\text{-}up}}\simeq\tau_{\rm{GSE}}\sim11\,\rm{Gyr}$. We
note an abrupt dearth of halo and Splash stars after a lookback time of
$10\,\rm{Gyr}$, marking the end of the merger interaction. Finally, we show
that Globular Clusters in the metallicity range $-0.8<\rm{[Fe/H]}<-0.3$ align
with a formation time of $\tau_{\rm{starburst}}\sim11\,\rm{Gyr}$, which we
interpret as a signature of a starburst triggered by the first pericentric
interaction of the GSE. This is remarkable corroboration between our GSE
interaction and starburst times of $\tau_{\rm GSE}=\tau_{\rm starburst} \sim
11\,$Gyr.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10144v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA) IV.

has been accreted by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). By leveraging
observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we investigate the
chrono-dynamical structure of a sample of seven old star clusters within the
LMC in a self-consistent way. The multi-epoch nature of the dataset allowed the
determination of high-precision proper motions for the clusters. Employing an
isochrone-fitting methodology, we additionally infer from the deep
high-resolution HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for their distances,
ages and metallicities. Supplementing these data with literature line-of-sight
velocities, we investigate the full 3-dimensional dynamics of the clusters
within the frame of the LMC. With respect to the other clusters in our sample,
NGC 1841 depicts a peculiar case. Its position in the age-metallicity plane,
that makes it about 1 Gyr younger than the other metal-poor LMC clusters, but
also its dynamical properties with a radial orbit almost perpendicular to the
LMC disc plane, clearly advocates for a different origin. We thus conclude that
NGC 1841 has likely been accreted by the LMC from a smaller galaxy. The other
clusters in our sample show disc-like kinematics, with the case of NGC 2210
being peculiar, based on its inclined orbit. Their coherent age-metallicity
relation closely resembles that of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters,
thus suggesting a similar early evolution for the two dwarf galaxies. We do not
find clear-cut chrono-kinematic evidence that NGC 2005 has been accreted by the
LMC as suggested by a previous study based on its chemical abundance pattern.
Regardless of its nature, its very old age illustrates that peculiar chemical
evolutions already emerge at very early times.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10275v1" target="_blank"><h2>A MeerKAT view of the parsec-scale jets in the black-hole X-ray binary

outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the
surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the
interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together
enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We
focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in
VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a
Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in
L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method
developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the
jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in
bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and
bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal
emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets,
slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes
range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and
3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to
different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data,
we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet.
Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different
ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other
XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from
different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the
environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger
age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09764v1" target="_blank"><h2>Witnessing downsizing in the making: quiescent and breathing galaxies at

$\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$ in six
extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting
their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent
manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust
candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the
observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional
forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the
solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from
interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data
from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which
we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent
and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold".
According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)
\geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ stopped forming stars at least
150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have
been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent
systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass
objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by

formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent
candidates at $z > 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early
passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models:

exceptionally high energy E = 220 PeV, whose origin remains unclear. The
corresponding value of the neutrino flux is in tension with the results of
other high-energy neutrino experiments. In this study, we discuss the
possibility that this neutrino is cosmogenic, i. e., produced by ultra-high
energy cosmic rays (UHECR) during their propagation through the intergalactic
medium. We adopt the UHECR flux models derived by the Telescope Array
experiment, which features a predominantly light mass composition. We show that
the predictions of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in these models are consistent
with the measurements of the KM3NeT-only and with that of the "global neutrino
observatory" at approximately 2${\sigma}$ level. Notably, this result is
achieved in a minimal version of the UHECR flux models, that assume one source
population with a standard cosmological evolution. We also estimate the
corresponding cosmogenic gamma-ray flux and show that it is consistent with
Fermi-LAT IGRB measurements and UHE gamma-ray limits; the improvement of the
latter can probe these predictions in future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09839v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optimized HDBSCAN clustering for reconstructing the merger history of

Way by identifying groups of stars sharing similar properties in a kinematical
or chemical abundance space. However, although being promising tools, their
efficiency has not yet been fully tested in a realistic cosmological framework.
We investigate the effectiveness of the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in the
recovery of the progenitors of Milky Way-type galaxies, using several systems
from the Auriga suite of simulations. We develop a methodology aimed at
improving the efficiency of the algorithm and avoiding fragmentation: First, we
use a 12-dimensional feature space including a range of chemodynamical
properties and stellar ages; furthermore, we optimise the algorithm using
information from the internal structure of the clusters of accreted stars. We
show that our approach yields good results in terms of both purity and
completeness of clusters for galaxies with different types of accretion
histories. We also evaluate the decrease in efficiency due to contamination by
in situ stars. While for accreted-only haloes the algorithm matches well the
recovered clusters with the individual progenitors and is able to recover
accretion events up to a redshift of accretion $z_{\rm acc}\sim3$, for accreted
+ in situ haloes it can only identify the more recent accretion events ($z_{\rm
acc} < 1$). However, the purity of the identified clusters remains remarkably
high even in this case. Our results suggest that HDBSCAN can efficiently
identify accreted debris in Milky Way-type galaxies in realistic conditions,
however, it requires careful optimization to provide valid results.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09979v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Hubble constant from the improved lens modeling of cluster-lensed

($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way

photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions,
we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc
from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean
radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec
scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$
amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant
populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral
arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that
85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars
($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent
$\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different
velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity
features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors,
including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or
phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on
approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will
enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed

hole accretes material from a massive companion. HMXBs are expected to have
experienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with
this event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends
on the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the
different evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on
their peculiar velocities ($V_{\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3
(Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs
hosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties
via Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for
differences between classes. Overall, $V_{\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100
km s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$
$\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring
$V_{\rm pec}$ $\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$. Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)
test, the null hypothesis that the peculiar velocities of both classes are
drawn from the same parent distribution can be robustly rejected, irrespective
of the background stellar velocity dispersion. Tests with binary population
synthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and
higher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the
magnitude of $V_{\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to
distinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous
inferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be
explained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between
the source classes at the instant of supernova.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09582v1" target="_blank"><h2>The emergence of globular clusters and globular-cluster-like dwarfs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ethan D.

the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery. Here we present a suite of
cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and
dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We
show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size-luminosity plane
and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread
to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated
globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their
host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter
are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day.
Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we
call 'globular-cluster-like dwarfs' (GCDs). These form from a single,
self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high
redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and
dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs.

two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A
slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries
(XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from
illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between
these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically
self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have
upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate
the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general
relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the
fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the
remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is
modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global
equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab
corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo
all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo,
the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the
disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now
able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This
approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry
using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not
appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when
global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore
truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives.

instruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due
to their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without
identified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer
(GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic
rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and
localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including
Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for
coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical
afterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC
triggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and
241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no
spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields
precise redshifts spanning $z\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics
of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the
presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with
Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying
$>3\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble
those of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the
long-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows
yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic
energies ($E_{jet}\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB
population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised
GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high
spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and
central engine diversity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10017v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rotating twisted magnetosphere of magnetars: approximate analytical

magnetars is presented. The poloidal flux is approximated by the self-similar
twisted dipole field. The toroidal field is obtained by the minimum torque
model. Under this approximation, it is found that: (1) The Y-point radius
decreases with the increase of twist of the magnetic field. (2) The polar cap
is larger for larger twist. (3) The particle outflow luminosity is larger for
larger twist. (4) The maximum acceleration potential, pulse width of magnetar
radio emission etc all increase with the twist. (5) For an untwisting
magnetosphere, the physical properties general evolves towards that of the
normal pulsars. The above findings are consistent with previous analytical and
numerical results. The larger polar cap may corresponds to the hot spot during
magnetar outburst. In general, a rotating twisted magnetosphere has larger open
field line regions. The radio emission of magnetars and fast radio burst may
both originates in the larger and evolving open field line regions of
magnetars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09288v1" target="_blank"><h2>GRMHD Study of Accretion onto time-like Naked Singularities</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Akhil Uniyal, Indu K.

After
the outburst, similar to the outbursts in 2015 and 2017, the source decayed
into a quiescent state. Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted
after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at
a level of $L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{33}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were
detected at $\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction
exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red
noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by
accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single
blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the
polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral
properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent
state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion. We discuss possible
mechanisms for the generation of pulsations in this regime and consider the
scenario of neutron star crust cooling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10115v1" target="_blank"><h2>An ultraviolet burst oscillation candidate from the low-mass X-ray

close to the neutron star spin frequency. They are observed during
thermonuclear Type I X-ray bursts from a number of low-mass X-ray binaries
(LMXBs) hosting a fast-spinning, weakly magnetic neutron star. Besides
measuring the spin frequencies, burst oscillations hold the potential to
accurately measure neutron star mass and radius, thus providing constraints on
the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities. Based on far-ultraviolet
(FUV) observations of the X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 taken with the Hubble Space
Telescope in 2003, we report a possible indication of ultraviolet burst
oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency ($\sim$552 Hz), potentially the
first such case for an LMXB. The candidate signal is observed during an $\sim$8
s interval in the rising phase of an FUV burst, which occurred $\sim$4 s after
a Type I X-ray burst. Through simulations, we estimated that the probability of
detecting the observed signal power from pure random noise is 3.7$\%$,
decreasing to 0.3$\%$ if only the burst rise interval is considered, during
which X-ray burst oscillations had already been observed in this source. The
background-subtracted folded pulse profile of the candidate FUV oscillations in
the (120-160 nm) band is nearly sinusoidal with a $\sim$16$\%$ pulsed fraction,
corresponding to a pulsed luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{33}$ erg/s.
Interpreting the properties of this candidate FUV burst oscillations in the
light of current models for optical-ultraviolet emission from neutron star
LMXBs faces severe problems. If signals of this kind are confirmed in future

by rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields. Determining these properties is
essential to interpret such signals, but current measurements are limited:
rotation estimates rely on electromagnetic detections and assume uniform
rotation, while inferring interior magnetic fields remains ambiguous due to a
lack of direct observations. Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron
stars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes
encode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics. Previous
studies have examined the individual effects of rotation and magnetic fields on
these modes, identifying magnetic suppression and establishing linear relations
for the frequencies of the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_F$ and $l=2$
quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$. However, few have investigated the combined
influence of rotation and magnetic fields. Here, for the first time, we
consider both rotation and a toroidal magnetic field to construct linear
relations for quantifying $f_F$ and $f_{^2f}$, showing that their combined
effects can be constrained by detecting these modes. Using 2D axisymmetric
simulations, we demonstrate that quasi-linear relations between $f_F$,
$f_{^2f}$, stellar compactness $M/R$, and kinetic-to-binding energy ratio
$T/|W|$ persist even with a toroidal magnetic field. The slope of these
relations depends on the toroidal magnetization constant $K_\mathrm{m}$.
Additionally, measuring the frequency ratio $f_{^2f}/f_F$ enables inference of
$T/|W|$ and the maximum magnetic field strength $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$.
Lastly, we show that differential rotation causes only minor deviations from
predictions for uniform rotation. Thus, this work demonstrates that rotational
and magnetic properties of neutron stars can be inferred from their fundamental
modes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09665v1" target="_blank"><h2>1.8 per cent measurement of $H_0$ from Cepheids alone</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Richard Stiskalek, Harry Desmond, Eleni Tsaprazi, Alan Heavens, Guilhem Lavaux, Stuart McAlpine, Jens Jasche</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 12 figures.

results. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H_0$ of sufficient
precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung
data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical
modelling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09929v1" target="_blank"><h2>Laplace-Fourier linear stability analysis of non-relativistic magnetized
  rotational jets: mode identification by Hamiltonian analysis and the
  occurrence of mode transitions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wu Fan, Yamada Shoichi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this paper, we conduct a linear stability analysis of magnetized and/or
rotating jets propagating in ambient matter that is also magnetized and/or
rotating, having in mind the application to the jet penetrating the
core/envelope of a massive star. We solve the linearized magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) equations in the non-relativistic regime by Laplace transform in time and
Fourier transform in space. In this formulation all unstable modes with the
same translational and azimuthal wave numbers can be obtained simultaneously by
searching for pole singularities in the complex plane. In order to determine
unambiguously their driving mechanisms, we evaluate the second-order
perturbation of the MHD Hamiltonian for individual eigenfunctions derived at
these singular points. We identify in our non-rotating models the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as one of the shear-driven modes and the
current-driven instability such as the kink instability (KKI). In rotational
models we also find the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as another
shear-driven mode. In some cases, we find that a mode changes its character
continuously from KKI to KHI (and vice versa) or from MRI to KHI as the jet
velocity is increased.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09811v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Improved Fit to the Density Distribution in Supersonic Isothermal
  Turbulence</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Evan Scannapieco, Marcus Brüggen, Philipp Grete, Liubin Pan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 7 figures, Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The density distribution of supersonic isothermal turbulence plays a critical
role in many astrophysical systems. It is commonly approximated by a lognormal
distribution with a variance of $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \ln(1 + b^2 M_{\rm
V}^2),$ where $s \equiv \ln \rho/\rho_0,$ $M_{\rm V}$ is the rms
volume-weighted Mach number, and $b$ is a parameter that depends on the driving
mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free),
or a mix of the two. However, this neglects the correlation time of driving
($\tau_{\rm a}$), which plays a key role whenever compressive driving is
significant. Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of
Mach numbers, $1\lesssim M_{\rm V}\lesssim 10$, driving mechanisms, and
$\tau_{\rm a}$ values. In the compressive case, we find that $\sigma_{s,V}^2$
scales approximately linearly with $M_{\rm V},$ and its dependence on
$\tau_{\rm a}$ is $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx M_{\rm V} [1 +
\frac{2}{3}(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)\Theta(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)]$, where
$\lambda_{\rm a} \equiv \ln(\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e})$, $\tau_{\rm e}$ is the
eddy turnover time, and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. Mixed-driven
turbulence shows a weaker dependence on $\tau_{\rm a},$ and for
solenoidally-driven turbulence, $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \frac{1}{3}M_{\rm V}$,
independent of $\tau_{\rm a}$ and consistent with the standard expression when
$M_V \lesssim 10.$ The volume-weighted mean and skewness also show systematic
trends with $M_{\rm V}$ and $\tau_{\rm a}$, deviating from lognormal
expectations. For the mass-weighted density distribution, we observe
significant broadening and skewness in compressively driven cases, especially
at large $\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e}$. These results provide a refined framework
for modeling astrophysical turbulence.</p></br></body>
