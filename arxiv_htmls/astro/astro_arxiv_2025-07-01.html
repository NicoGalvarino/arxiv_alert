Sheth</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Future near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy surveys will target high-redshift
emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to test cosmological models. Deriving optimal
constraints from emission-line galaxy clustering hinges on a robust
understanding of their environmental dependence. Using the TNG300-1 simulation,
we explore the correlation between properties of H$\alpha$ emitters and their
environment anisotropy rather than traditional density-based measures. Our
galactic H$\alpha$ emission model includes contributions from the warm
interstellar medium. The environment anisotropy and type are assigned using a
halo mass-dependent smoothing scale. We find that most luminous ELGs
($L_{\rm{H}\alpha}>10^{42}\ \rm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) reside in filaments and knots.
More generally, ELGs are more biased in strongly anisotropic environments.
While correlations with galactic properties are found to be weak, they are
statistically significant for host halo masses $M\lesssim 10^{12}\ M_\odot/h$.
Our analysis motivates further investigation into how environmental anisotropy
influences galaxy evolution, and highlights the potential for leveraging these
effects in the analyses of upcoming cosmological surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24128v1" target="_blank"><h2>Beneath the Surface: >85% of z>5.9 QSOs in Massive Host Galaxies are

galaxy mass, aiming to identify those in the most massive hosts. [CII]
luminosity, a known tracer of molecular gas, is taken as a proxy for host mass
and used to rank 190 QSOs at z>5.9, spanning a 6-mag UV luminosity range
(-22<Muv<-28). Particularly valuable are ALMA data from a cycle-10 CISTERN
program, providing [CII] coverage for 46 UV-faint (M_{UV,AB}>-24.5) and 25
especially UV-faint (Muv>-23.5) QSOs, improving statistics by 5x and 6x,
respectively. Taking massive host galaxies to be those where L[CII]>1.8x10^9
Lsol (median L[CII] of UV-bright QSOs), we identify 61 QSOs, including 13 which
are UV-faint and 7 especially UV-faint. Using these selections and recent QSO
luminosity functions (LFs), we present the first characterization of UV
luminosity distribution for QSOs in massive host galaxies and quantify [CII]
LFs for both UV-bright and UV-faint QSOs. While ~3% of massive-host QSOs are
UV-bright (Muv<-26), >~85% are UV-faint (Muv>-24.5). This wide dispersion in UV
luminosities reflects variations in dust obscuration, accretion efficiency, and
black hole mass. Though spectroscopy is needed for definitive conclusions,
black hole mass appears to be the dominant factor driving variations in the UV
luminosity, based on 34 [CII]-luminous (L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol) QSOs distributed
across a ~3-mag baseline in UV luminosity and with measured MBH. At Muv~-23,
the median extrapolated log10 (MBH/Msol) is 8.1+/-0.4, consistent with the
local relation. SMBHs in UV-bright QSOs thus appear to be ~15(-9)(+25)x more
massive than typical for massive host galaxies at z~6.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22642v1" target="_blank"><h2>DeepDive: A deep dive into the physics of the first massive quiescent

JWST/NIRSpec G235M/F170LP spectra for 10 primary massive
($\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}=10.8-11.5$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim3-4$. A novel
reduction procedure extends the nominal wavelength coverage of G235M beyond
H$\alpha$ and [NII] at $z\sim4$, revealing weak, narrow H$\alpha$ lines
indicative of low star formation rates (${\rm SFR}\sim0-5\, M_\odot\, {\rm

indicating the presence of AGNs. We also conduct an archival search of
quiescent galaxies observed with NIRSpec gratings in the DAWN JWST Archive,
which provides a statistical context for interpreting the DeepDive targets.
This archival search provides a spectroscopic sample of 140 quiescent galaxies
spanning $1<z<5$ and covering more than an order of magnitude in stellar mass.
We revisit the selection of quiescent galaxies based on rest-frame $UVJ$
colors, specific star formation rates, and the detection of the 4000\r{A}
spectral break, finding $\sim90\%$ overlap between these criteria. The sample
of a total of 150 quiescent galaxies constructed in this study shows that those
at $z\sim3-5$, including the DeepDive targets, typically exhibit weaker
4000\r{A} breaks and bluer colors than their lower-redshift counterparts,
indicating generally younger stellar populations. Stacked spectra of sources
grouped by the $D_n4000$ index reveal faint Iron and Magnesium absorption line
features in the stellar continuum even for the low $D_n4000$ ($D_n4000<1.35$)
subsample at high redshift ($z\sim3$). In addition, higher $D_n4000$ subsamples
show fainter nebular emission lines. These results demonstrate that
medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy is essential for robustly characterizing
the diversity and evolution of early quiescent galaxies. All data from this
study will be made publicly available.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22367v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation with Galaxy Clustering

roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a
theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from
Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work
include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy

$\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with

the stellar mass sample to be of general interest for other science cases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23899v1" target="_blank"><h2>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and

geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal
relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on
the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands
(where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN
physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss
possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we
review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their
properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally,
we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and
next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool
to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21838v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Comprehensive Multiwavelength Study of the OH Megamaser galaxy IRAS

excitation of the OH megamaser galaxy IRAS 09320+6134 (UGC 5101) using Gemini
Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit, Hubble Space Telescope, and Very
Large Array observations. The HST ACS F814W i-band and H$\alpha$ + [N II]
$\lambda\lambda$ 6548,84 narrow-band images indicate that this galaxy is a
late-stage merger. The ionized gas emission in the inner $\sim$ 2 kpc radius,
traced by the GMOS data, is consistent with two kinematic components: (i) a
rotating disk, observed as a narrow component in the emission-line profiles,
with velocity dispersion of $\sigma$ $\leq$ 200 km s$^{-1}$, and (ii) an
outflow, traced by a broad component in the emission-line profiles, with
$\sigma\geq$ 500 km s$^{-1}$. The disk component is well reproduced by a model
of rotation in a plane with similar orientation to that of the large-scale
galaxy disk. The outflow component presents bulk velocities of up to -500 km
s$^{-1}$ and corresponds to a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_o = 0.122 \pm 0.026
M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Emission-line ratio diagrams indicate that the gas
excitation is mainly due to an active galactic nucleus, likely the driver of
the outflow. The VLA radio image reveals a dominant radio core with two-sided
emission along the NE-SW direction. The radio core's spectral index and
brightness temperature indicate AGN emission, with the extended emission
resembling both in morphology and spectral index the emission observed in
radio-quiet quasars. Combined with previous similar studies of other OHM
galaxies, the present work supports that this phase is linked to the triggering
of an AGN, that seems to occur in the final stages of a merger.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22547v1" target="_blank"><h2>MOSDEF-3D: Keck/OSIRIS Maps of the Ionized ISM in $z \sim 2$ Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Natalie Lam, Alice E.

conditions of the ISM at Cosmic Noon. Our analysis of strong emission line
ratios in these galaxies reveals an offset from the local star-forming locus on
the BPT diagram, but agrees with other star-forming galaxies at similar
redshifts. Despite the offset towards higher [O III]$\lambda5008$/H$\beta$ and
[N II]$\lambda6585$/H$\alpha$, these strong-line ratios remain consistent with
or below the maximum starburst threshold even in the inner $\sim 1$ kpc region
of the galaxies, providing no compelling evidence for central AGN activity. The
galaxies also exhibit flat radial gas-phase metallicity gradients, consistent
with previous studies of $z \sim 2$ galaxies and suggesting efficient radial
mixing possibly driven by strong outflows from intense star formation. Overall,
our results reveal the highly star-forming nature of these galaxies, with the
potential to launch outflows that flatten metallicity gradients through
significant radial gas mixing. Future observations with JWST/NIRSpec are
crucial to detect fainter emission lines at higher spatial resolution to
further constrain the physical processes and ionization mechanisms that shape
the ISM during Cosmic Noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22812v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing foreground residuals in cleaned CMB temperature maps from Planck</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sanjeet K.

observations using a variety of cleaning procedures. However, in regions of
strong microwave emission, particularly in the galactic plane from our own
galaxy Milky Way and some extended or point sources, the recovered CMB signal
is not reliable. Thus, a galactic mask is provided along with the
\emph{cleaned} CMB sky for use with that CMB map which excises sky regions that
may still be potentially contaminated even after cleaning. So, to avoid bias in
our inferences, we impose such a foreground mask. In this paper, we analyze a
cleaned CMB map from Planck PR4 to probe for any foreground residuals that may
still be present \emph{outside} the galactic mask where the derived CMB sky is
considered clean. To that end, we employ a local cross-correlation coefficient
statistic where we cross-correlate widely used foreground templates that trace
galactic synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission from our galaxy with
the cleaned CMB sky. Using simulations, we find that few regions of the derived
CMB sky are still contaminated and have to be omitted. Based on this study, we
derived a mask that could be used in conjugation with the standard mask to
further improve the purpose of galactic masks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23829v1" target="_blank"><h2>Enhanced Thermodynamic Framework for Third-Order Galaxy Correlation

$Y_\mathrm{P}$, based on Subaru observations. A major source of uncertainty in
previous $Y_\mathrm{P}$ determinations is the lack of extremely metal-poor
galaxies (EMPGs; $0.01-0.1Z_\odot$), which have metallicities a few to ten
times lower than the metal-poor galaxies (MPGs; $0.1-0.4Z_\odot$) predominantly
used in earlier studies, requiring substantial extrapolation to zero
metallicity. Here, we perform Subaru near-infrared spectroscopy of 29 galaxies,
including 14 EMPGs. By incorporating existing optical spectra, we derive He/H
for each galaxy using photoionization modeling of helium and hydrogen emission
lines, including the He I 10830 {\AA} line to break the density-temperature
degeneracy. After carefully selecting galaxies with robust He/H determinations,
and adding 58 galaxies from previous studies, we obtain $Y_\mathrm{P} =
0.2387^{+0.0036}_{-0.0031}$. This $Y_\mathrm{P}$ value is $\sim1\sigma$ lower
than most of the previous estimates, but agrees with recent determinations
using EMPGs and the CMB constraint from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)
experiment. Our result indicates $N_\mathrm{eff} = 2.54^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$,
showing a mild ($1-2\sigma$) tension with the Standard Model and Planck
results. These tensions may suggest a nonzero lepton asymmetry, which would be
alleviated with $\xi_\mathrm{e} = 0.05^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. More observations of
EMPGs and further assessments of systematic uncertainties are essential to test
the potential tension more rigorously.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21827v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards an Observational Detection of Halo Spin Bias using Spin-Orbit

The clustering of dark-matter halos depends primarily on halo mass.
However, at fixed halo mass, numerical simulations have revealed multiple
secondary dependencies. This so-called secondary halo bias has important
implications for our understanding of structure formation and observational
cosmology. Despite its significance, the effect has not yet been measured
observationally with statistical confidence. Aims. We aim to develop the first
observational method to probe halo spin bias: the secondary dependence of halo
clustering on halo spin at fixed halo mass. Methods. We use a proxy for halo
spin based on the coherent motion of galaxies within and around a halo. This
technique is tested using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation and
subsequently applied to a group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). By splitting the SDSS groups according to this spin proxy and measuring
the two-point correlation function of the resulting samples, the existence of
halo spin bias is investigated. Results. We find consistent indications that,
at fixed mass, groups with higher values of the spin proxy exhibit higher bias
than those with lower spin proxy values, on scales of 5-15
${h}^{-1}$$\mathrm{Mpc}$. The highest significance is seen for groups with halo
masses ${M}_{\rm h} \gtrsim {10}^{13.2}$ ${h}^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$, for which
85$\%$ of the sampled measurements display the expected trend. As we continue
to improve the method, our results could open new avenues for studying the
connection between halo spin and the large-scale structure with upcoming
spectroscopic surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22737v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the signature of assembly bias and modified gravity using

simulation suite for General Relativity (GR) to investigate its efficacy in
identifying the signature of assembly bias and Modified Gravity (MG). In the
investigation of assembly bias, utilizing galaxy clustering data ranging from
scales of $0.1 - 60 \text{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, we discover that our emulator model
accurately recreates the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$,
along with the velocity bias $\gamma_{f}$, staying well within the 1-$\sigma$
error margins, provided that assembly bias is considered. Ignoring assembly
bias can considerably alter our model constraints on parameters $\Omega_m$ and
$\sigma_8$ if the test sample includes assembly bias. Using our emulator for MG
simulations, which encompasses two Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models (DGP; N1, N5)
and two $f(R)$ models (F4, F6), we can effectively identify a robust signature
of modified gravity, for models such as DGP-N1 and $f(R)$-F4, as indicated by a
noticeable deviation of $\gamma_{f}$ from unity. Using the velocity dispersion
of dark matter halos to effectively represent the underlying strength of the
velocity field of these MG simulations, we find that the simple $\gamma_{f}$
model can recover the truth with minimal bias. These evaluations indicate that
our simple halo-velocity bias model is capable of detecting significant MG
characteristics, although additional methodologies should be pursued to improve
model constraints.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22147v1" target="_blank"><h2>JADES reveals a large population of low mass black holes at high

various stacks, we detect a broad component of H$\alpha$ without a counterpart
in [OIII], implying that it is not due to outflows but is tracing the Broad
Line Region (BLR) of a large population of low-luminosity AGN not detected in
individual spectra. We also consider the possible contribution from Supernovae
(SNe) and Very Massive Stars and conclude that while this is very unlikely, we
cannot exclude some potential contribution by SNe to some of the stacks. The
detection, in some stacks, of high [OIII]4363/H$\gamma$, typical of AGN,
further confirms that such stacks reveal a large population of AGN. We infer
that the stacks probe black holes with masses of a few times $10^6~M_\odot$
accreting at rates $L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.02-0.1$, i.e. a low mass and dormant
parameter space poorly explored by previous studies on individual targets. We
identify populations of black holes that fall within the scatter of the local
$M_{BH}-M_{*}$ scaling relation, indicating that there is a population of
high-z BHs that are not overmassive relative to their host galaxies and which
have been mostly missed in previous JWST observations. Yet, on average, the
stacks are still overmassive relative the local relation, with some of them 1-2
dex above it. We infer that the BH mass function (BHMF) at $3<z<5$ rises
steeply at low masses. The BHMF is consistent with models in which BHs evolve
through short bursts of super-Eddington accretion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22794v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observed Anti-parallel Correlation Between Spiral Galaxy and Cosmic

the cosmic web remains a pivotal issue in galaxy formation. Using kinematic
data from the MaNGA survey, we investigate the alignment between the spin
directions of spiral galaxies and their host cosmic filaments. By incorporating
filament spin measurements derived from redshift asymmetry across filament
spines, we reveal a mass-dependent anti-parallel correlation: low-mass spiral
galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) \lesssim 10$) exhibit a statistically
significant anti-parallel alignment between their stellar/gas spins and
filament spins, while high-mass spirals show no such trend. Spatial analysis
further indicates that high-mass spirals preferentially reside near filament
spines, whereas low-mass spirals occupy filament outskirts. These findings
extend previous alignment studies that neglected directional spin correlations
and provide new insights into how cosmic environments shape galactic angular
momentum. The observed anti-parallel trend suggests a critical role for
filament spin in regulating the angular momentum acquisition of low-mass
spirals. This anti-parallel alignment is significantly enhanced for low-mass
spirals residing in dynamically cold filaments, highlighting the importance of
filament properties in shaping galaxy spin.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24077v1" target="_blank"><h2>The distribution of metals in simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Federico G.

centre of dark matter haloes, which gives rise to stellar discs once the gas
reaches high density. Analysis of stellar age distribution shows that stars in
the inner regions of the disc are born at earlier times, in contrast to those
found in the outer regions, which constitute a younger population. This scheme,
typical of galactic formation processes, is known as the "inside-out" scenario
and is closely related to the global properties of a significant fraction of
the population of spiral galaxies. In this study, we analyse model galaxies
from the Auriga project, a set of high-resolution, magnetohydrodynamic
cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, to investigate the
distribution of metals at $z=0$. Since different galactic components were
subjected to different formation histories, we focus on the distribution of
metals in the halo, bulge, and disc using a dynamical decomposition method
based on the degree of rotation of the stars and their gravitational potential.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22074v1" target="_blank"><h2>The dynamical lineage of ultra-diffuse galaxies from TNG50-1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nilanjana Nandi, Arunima Banerjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 12 figures, 1 table</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The formation and evolution of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) continues to
remain a puzzle. Similarities and differences in the morphological and the
kinematical properties of the UDGs with their possible precursors, namely
low-surface brightness (LSBs), L*-type high-surface brightness (HSBs) and dwarf
galaxies, may provide crucial constraints on their origin and evolution. We
selected samples of UDGs, LSBs, HSBs and dwarfs from TNG50-1. We first obtained
a few possible scaling relations involving some mass properties to analyse if
the regression fits for UDGs are in compliance with those of the other samples.
Then, we studied individual galaxy cutouts to evaluate the intrinsic shapes of
their dark-matter (DM) and stellar components, orbital and kinematical
properties related to their stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we
constructed the mock IFU data using the SimSpin code to extract the stellar
kinematic moment maps. We observe that the UDGs and the dwarf galaxies have
nearly similar regression fits in a. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs gas mass, b.
stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs total dynamical mass, c. stellar central surface
density vs ratio of stellar-to-total dynamical mass, and d. total baryonic mass
vs total dynamical mass parameter spaces. Next, we find that the isolated UDGs
are prolate rotators similar to the dwarf population, while the tidally-bound
UDGs can exhibit both prolate and oblate-rotating shapes. The DM and stellar
velocity anisotropy properties of the UDGs suggest that they reside in a cored,
dwarf-like halo and may be classified by early-type galaxies. Finally, the
stellar kinematic properties suggest that both the UDGs and the dwarfs are
slow-rotators having low to nearly no-rotations in contrast to the late-type,
disc-dominated, fast-rotating LSBs and HSBs. Therefore, we may conclude that
the UDGs and the dwarfs possibly have a common dynamical lineage.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22416v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmology from Planck CMB Lensing and DESI DR1 Quasar Tomography</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R. de Belsunce, A.

redshift range 0.8 <= z <= 3.5 from the cross correlation of over 1.2 million
spectroscopic quasars selected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
(DESI) across 7,200 deg$^2$ (approx 170 quasars/deg$^2$) and Planck PR4 (NPIPE)
cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps. We perform a tomographic
measurement in three bins centered at effective redshifts z=1.44, 2.27 and
2.75, which have ample overlap with the CMB lensing kernel. From a joint fit
using the angular clustering of all three redshift bins (auto and
cross-spectra), and including an $\Omega_m$ prior from DESI DR1 baryon acoustic
oscillations to break the $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ degeneracy, we constrain the
amplitude of matter fluctuations in the matter-dominated regime to be
$\sigma_8=0.929^{+0.059}_{-0.074}$ and $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}
= 0.922^{+0.059}_{-0.073}$. We provide a growth of structure measurement with
the largest spectroscopic quasar sample to date at high redshift, which is
1.5$\sigma$ higher than predictions from $\Lambda$CDM fits to measurements of
the primary CMB from Planck PR4. The cross-correlation between PR4 lensing maps
and DESI DR1 quasars is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 21.7 and the
quasar auto-correlation at 27.2 for the joint analysis of all redshift bins. We
combine our measurement with the CMB lensing auto-spectrum from the

sound-horizon-free measurement of the Hubble constant, yielding
$H_0=69.1^{+2.2}_{-2.6}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ through
