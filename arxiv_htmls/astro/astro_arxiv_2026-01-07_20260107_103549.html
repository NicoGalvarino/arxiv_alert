This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full population mass spectrum of CBCs on the estimation of the Hubble constant. This model is designed to test the impact of heavy black holes in GW cosmology. We perform a joint inference of cosmological and population parameters using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with a false alarm rate smaller than 0.25 per year, using both spectral and dark siren approaches. With spectral sirens, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}\,{\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), while the dark siren method yields $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}\,{\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL). These results improve the uncertainty by approximately 30.4% and 36.2%, respectively. We show that this improvement is linked to the presence of a new mass scale in the binary black hole mass spectrum at $63.3^{+4.8}_{-4.8}\,M_{\odot}$, which provides additional constraints on the Hubble constant. Besides providing the tightest standard-siren constraints on $H_0$, this highlights the importance of a heavy-mass feature in the black hole spectrum.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03240v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Squeezed Bispectrum from CHIME HI Emission and Planck CMB Lensing: Current Sensitivity and Forecasts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> CHIME Collaboration, Arnab Chakraborty, Matt Dobbs, Simon Foreman, Liam Gray, Mark Halpern, Gary Hinshaw, Albin Joseph, Joshua MacEachern, Kiyoshi W.

This motivates cross-correlations, to ascertain the cosmological nature of measured HI fluctuations, and to study their connections with galaxies and the underlying matter density field. However, these same foregrounds render the cross-correlation with projected fields such as the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) difficult. Indeed, the correlated Fourier modes vary slowly along the line of sight, and are thus most contaminated by the smooth-spectrum radio continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we implement a method that avoids this issue by attempting to measure the non-linear gravitational coupling of the small-scale 21cm power from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with large-scale Planck CMB lensing. This measurement is a position-dependent power spectrum, i.e. a squeezed integrated bispectrum. Using 94 nights of CHIME data between $1.0 < z < 1.3$ and aggressive foreground filtering, we find that the expected signal is five times smaller than the current noise. We forecast that incorporating the additional nights of CHIME data already collected would enable a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, without any further improvements in filtering for foreground cleaning.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03140v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large-scale radio bubbles around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Noa Grollimund, Stéphane Corbel, Rob Fender, James H.

Recently, the detection of large-scale very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr and other BH-jet systems suggested that jets from microquasars may play an important role in the production of galactic cosmic rays. V4641 Sgr is known for its superluminal radio jet discovered in 1999, but no radio counterpart of a large-scale jet has been observed. The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism. We suggest that the bow-tie structure arose from the long-term action of large-scale jets or disk winds from V4641 Sgr. If the emission mechanism is of synchrotron origin, the radio/X-ray extended structure implies acceleration of electrons up to more than 100 TeV as far as tens of parsecs from the black hole.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03122v1" target="_blank"><h2>Late-time Background Constraints on Linear and Non-linear Interacting Dark Energy after DESI DR2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> David Figueruelo, Marcel van der Westhuizen, Amare Abebe, Eleonora Di Valentino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title), high redshift (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this study, we present observational constraints on a class of phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models that admit analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We consider a set of five linear and three non-linear IDE scenarios, encompassing both interactions proportional to the dark matter and/or dark energy densities, as well as non-linear combinations of the two. For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $Λ$CDM from a $Δχ^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($Δ$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3Hδρ_{\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3Hδρ_{\rm de}$ and $Q=3Hδ\left(\tfrac{ρ_{\rm de}^2}{ρ_{\rm dm}+ρ_{\rm de}}\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}>-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}<-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03028v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bounce Inflation with Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of DESI DR2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xin-zhe Zhang, Hao-Hao Li, Taotao Qiu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages and 4 figures. All comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $Λ$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$σ$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \pm 2.1 \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$σ$ confidence of $Λ$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02889v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing ionized bubbles around luminous sources during reionization with SKA 21-cm observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Arnab Mishra, Kanan Kumar Datta, Chandra Shekhar Murmu, Samir Choudhuri, Iffat Nasreen, Snehasish Saha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Detecting and characterizing individual ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using the redshifted HI 21-cm signal provides a direct probe of the early ionizing sources and the intergalactic medium. We develop and validate a computationally efficient estimator that operates on gridded visibilities to detect ionized bubbles. This serves as an accurate alternative to the more computationally demanding bare estimator that uses all baselines and frequency channels. Further, we employ a non-parametric foreground-subtraction method based on Gaussian process regression, which minimizes loss of the HI 21-cm signal and yields improved signal-to-noise ratios. Our analysis indicates that ionized bubbles at redshifts $z \sim 7 - 8$ can be detected with SNR $\gtrsim 10$ using $\sim 100$ hours of SKA1-Low AA$^*$ and AA4 observations. We further derive a scaling relation that connects the SNR to the bubble radius, redshift, total observing time, and the mean neutral hydrogen fraction of the surrounding IGM. This helps to quickly predict the observational outcome for any planned observations and is, therefore, useful for devising observational strategies. Finally, we apply a Bayesian likelihood framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to the residual visibilities to recover ionized bubble properties, including radius, position, and the mean neutral fraction. The resulting posterior distributions demonstrate accurate recovery of the bubble parameters. This confirms the feasibility of robustly characterizing individual ionized regions with the SKA1-Low.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02865v1" target="_blank"><h2>GATOS XI : Excess dust heating in the Narrow Line Regions of nearby AGN revealed with JWST/MIRI</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Houda Haidar, David J.

In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\rm shock} \sim 200- 400 \, \rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02861v1" target="_blank"><h2>BEACON: JWST NIRCam Pure-parallel Imaging Survey.

Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to $\sim350$\,arcmin$^2$ sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope ($β_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at $z=13.71\pm0.15$ has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of $M_{\rm UV}=-21.19\pm0.08$, making it the brightest galaxy at $z>12$ if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with $>3σ$ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at $z>7$, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02849v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Anisotropy of Dispersion Measure Contribution from the Galactic Halo by Using Fast Radio Bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yang Liu, Bao Wang, Puxun Wu, Jun-Jie Wei, Xue-Feng Wu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables; Accepted by ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a data-driven approach to reconstruct the all-sky distribution of the dispersion measure contribution from the Galactic halo ($\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$) through a spherical harmonic expansion, enabling an investigation of its possible anisotropies. Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes $|b|>15^\circ$, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$, pointing toward $(l=130^\circ,\, b=+5^\circ)$ with a $1σ$ uncertainty of approximately $28^\circ$. The $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$ value in this direction is $63\pm9~\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, exceeding the all-sky mean by about $2.6σ$. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic ISM models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of $(l=141^\circ,\, b=+51^\circ)$ and a larger 1$σ$ uncertainty of $\sim 44^\circ$. Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02801v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transient Large-Scale Anisotropy in TeV Cosmic Rays due to an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhen Cao, F.

Transient anisotropy changes have been observed below 150 GeV, especially near the passage of an interplanetary shock and coronal mass ejection containing a magnetic flux rope ejected by a solar storm, which can trigger a geomagnetic storm with practical consequences. In such events, cosmic rays provide remote sensing of the magnetic field properties. Here we report the observation of transient large-scale anisotropy in TeV cosmic ray ions using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We analyze hourly skymaps of the transient cosmic ray intensity excess or deficit, the gradient of which indicates the direction and magnitude of transient large-scale anisotropy across the field of view. We observe enhanced anisotropy above typical hourly fluctuations with $>$5$σ$ significance during some hours of November 4, 2021, in separate data sets for four primary cosmic ray energy ranges of median energy from $E$=0.7 to 3.1 TeV. The gradient varies with energy as $E^γ$, where $γ\approx-0.5$. At a median energy $\leq$1.0 TeV, this gradient corresponds to a dipole anisotropy of at least 1\%, or possibly a weaker anisotropy of higher order.

This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}<0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$. The model fits the data in a similar way to the CPL parametrization, without the dark energy to cross the phantom divide line.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02734v1" target="_blank"><h2>Super-Orbital Variations in Magnetar Rotation Measure Arising from the Precession of Companion Star: Implications for FRB 20220529</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ze-Xin Du, Yun-Wei Yu, Aming Chen, Chen-Hui Niu, Jia-Heng Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent observations of FRB 20220529 reveal significant variation and a partial reversal in its rotation measure (RM), suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving magnetized environment, which could be caused by the orbital motion of the magnetar within the binary system. Here we develop the binary model by suggesting that the spin and magnetic axis of the companion star could undergo precession around the orbital axis. It is then investigated how the precession period and the inclination of the magnetic axis, as well as a possible disc wind, can influence the evolution behaviors of the RM and dispersion measure (DM) of FRB emission. As the foremost consequence, the RM variation can be significantly altered on timescales longer than the orbital period, producing super-orbital evolution and complex patterns. Applying this model to FRB 20220529, we find that its RM evolution could be reproduced with a precession period of 182 days and an inclination angle of approximately $19^{\circ}$, while the other binary parameters are fixed at their typical values. Meanwhile, the absence of significant variation of the DM argues against the presence of a dense equatorial disc around the companion star, which would be constrained by future long-term observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02724v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Tale of Two Dust Disks in Our Milky</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ruoyi Zhang, Haibo Yuan, Bingqiu Chen, Maosheng Xiang, Yang Huang, Xiaowei Liu, Jifeng Liu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (title, abstract), atomic hydrogen (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic dust plays a vital role in stellar and galactic formation and evolution, but its three-dimensional structure in the Milky Way has remained unclear due to insufficient precise reddening and distance measurements. Although early studies typically adopted a single-disk model, we detect two distinct components at Galactocentric distances of 5-14 kpc, enabled by photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric measurements of over 5 million stars. The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively. The gas-to-dust ratio shows an exponential radial gradient, increasing from around 60 at 5 kpc to around 470 at 14 kpc. These findings provide new insights into dust morphology in the Galaxy and raise fundamental questions that require further investigation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02678v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Origin of Spin-Alignment of Dark Matter Subhalos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daiki Osafune, Keiichi Wada, Tomoaki Ishiyama, Takashi Okamoto<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), ISM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Subhalo spin is essential for modeling galaxy formation and controlling systematic uncertainties in intrinsic alignment (IA) studies. However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02638v1" target="_blank"><h2>SN 2024abfl: A Flat-Plateau, Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernova with Early CSM Interaction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Madison Gerard, Jennifer E.

The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_V = -14.9$ and exhibited an extended, flat plateau lasting $\sim$125 days. From the late-time bolometric light curve, we estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim0.01~M_\odot$, consistent with other LLSNe. Analytical shock-cooling models fail to reproduce the rapid early rise, indicating that circumstellar material (CSM) interaction contributed to the initial emission. The spectroscopic evolution is typical of LLSNe, with relatively narrow metal lines and low expansion velocities ($\lesssim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) that decline slowly over time. We detect a broad ``ledge'' feature around 4600 Åwithin three days of explosion, which we interpret as a blend of high-ionization shock-accelerated CSM lines. Multi-peaked H$α$ profiles develop during the plateau phase, consistent with complex ejecta-CSM interactions. As one of the best-observed examples of LLSNe, SN 2024abfl exhibits a weak explosion and signatures of nearby CSM, offering new insights into progenitor properties, pre-explosion mass loss, and the diversity of LLSNe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02579v1" target="_blank"><h2>COUGS-DESI: A Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with Polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Seneca K.

These systems, which include polar rings, polar disks, polar halos, polar bulges, polar dust lanes, and polar tidal structures, provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution, although their rarity has limited statistical studies. We aim to construct the largest and most homogeneous catalog of PSGs to date in order to enable robust statistical studies of their properties and occurrence rates in the local Universe. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR10) data, we identified PSG candidates in the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA) through visual inspection, convolutional neural network classification, and cross-matching with previously reported systems. Each galaxy was assigned a PSG subtype and host morphology. We analyzed general properties of PSGs and compared them with those for all galaxies in the SGA. Simple image simulations were used to evaluate projection effects. The resulting Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (COUGS-DESI) contains 2,989 PSG candidates, including 342 previously known objects. Projection effects from random galaxy overlaps are negligible. The sample spans a wide range of polar morphologies, with 1,113 polar rings, 75 polar bulges, 216 polar halos, 185 polar dust lanes, and 1,315 polar tidal structures. PSGs constitute 2.2% of local non-dwarf galaxies, with polar rings representing 0.7%. Approximately 1% of S0 galaxies in the SGA host polar rings, whereas spirals constitute the most common morphological type among the PSG hosts in our catalog. COUGS--DESI increases the number of known PSG candidates by an order of magnitude and provides a foundation for detailed studies of the formation and evolution of polar structures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02534v1" target="_blank"><h2>Composite Bulges -- V.

By removing angular momentum, shocks in gas cause inflows, which can trigger nuclear star formation and fuel AGN activity. To identify the signatures of extended shocks, we examine residual velocity fields after subtracting a modelled rotating disc, and we study velocity difference between various gas tracers. Combining our kinematic analysis with BPT ionisation diagnostic maps and dust morphology, we find that 11 of 21 galaxies ($\sim$52%) show extended shock signatures with velocity jumps consistent with models of bar-driven shocks. This is likely a lower limit, as three additional galaxies ($\sim$15%) exhibit shocks along bars, potentially reaching the nucleus but obscured by AGN outflows. We trace shock signatures inwards close to the resolution limit, which suggests that shocks may be the prevailing mechanism of inflow in the central kpc of galaxies. The only two unbarred galaxies in our sample are also the only systems with unperturbed kinematics and no shocks, strongly linking the perturbed gas dynamics in centres of galaxies to the presence of bars. All galaxies with inner bars show LINER- or Seyfert-like nuclear emission, whereas galaxies without inner bars exhibit all emission types, indicating that regardless of gas supply, inner bars suppress star formation in galactic nuclei.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02495v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas rotation and turbulence in the galaxy cluster Abell 2029</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> T.

  We reduce and conduct the spectral analysis of the XRISM/Resolve data. The rotating, turbulent ICM in the model has a composite polytropic distribution in equilibrium in a spherically-symmetric, cosmologically motivated dark halo. The profile of rotation velocity and the distribution of turbulent velocity dispersion are described with flexible functional forms, consistent with the properties of synthetic clusters formed in cosmological simulations. Adopting realistic profiles for the metallicity distribution of the ICM and for the point spread function of XRISM and XMM-Newton, we tune via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm the observables of the intrinsic quantities of the plasma in our model to reproduce the radial profiles of the thermodynamic quantities as derived from the spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and Planck maps and the measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) non-thermal velocity dispersion and redshift (probing the LOS velocity) in the XRISM pointings.
  Our model accurately reproduces the measurements of redshift and LOS non-thermal velocity dispersion, as further demonstrated by simulating and analyzing synthetic counterparts of the XRISM spectra, in accordance with the posterior distribution of our model. We find turbulence-to-total pressure ratio $\approx$ 2% across the (0 - 650) kpc radial range, and a rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio peaking at 0.15 between 200 - 600 kpc. The hydrostatic-to-total mass ratio is $\approx$ 0.97 at r2500, the radius enclosing an overdensity of 2500 times the average value.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02494v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Origins of Azimuthal Metallicity Variations in the Galactic Disk: Insights from Kinematic Ridges with Gaia</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Carlos Jurado, Keith Hawkins, Jason A.

At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridge-like features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia DR3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the V_phi-R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of Milky Way test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemo-kinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations are too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and co-moving groups.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02483v1" target="_blank"><h2>CHANG-ES XXXVI.

Cosmic rays and magnetic fields play an important role for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Radio continuum observations allows us to study them in the haloes of edge-on galaxies. Aims. We explore the frequency dependence of the radio scale height which depends on cosmic ray transport and electron cooling. We test the influence of fundamental galaxy properties, such as star-formation rate (SFR), mass and size. Methods. We used radio continuum data of 16 edge-on galaxies from the Continuum HAloes in Nearby Galaxies -- an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). We included maps from the LOw Frequency ARray at 144 MHz and from the Jansky Very Large Array at 3 GHz with 7" angular resolution. We extracted vertical intensity profiles within the effective radio radius and fitted beam-convolved double-exponential models to separate thin and thick discs. For the thick radio discs, we computed mean spectral indices and scale-height ratios between 144 MHz and 3 GHz. Results. We find a mean scale-height ratio of 1.26 \pm 0.16. This is much lower than what we would expect for either cosmic ray diffusion or advection if synchrotron and inverse Compton losses dominate for the electrons. There is a moderate positive correlation between the ratio and spectral index of the thick disc: galaxies with high ratios have flat radio spectra. The ratio does not depend on any other galaxy parameter. The radio spectrum of the thick disc, as indicated by the radio spectral index, steepens with total mass (strong correlation) and flattens with SFR-to-mass surface density (moderate correlation). Conclusions. Galaxies with galactic winds have flat radio continuum spectra and large scale heights at low frequencies. This shows effective transport of cosmic rays in such systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02482v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving the Fe K$α$ Doublet of the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud G0.11-0.11 with XRISM</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Stephen DiKerby, Shuo Zhang, Kumiko Nobukawa, Masayoshi Nobukawa, Yuma Aoki, Jack Uteg<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, accepted in ApJ-Letters<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fe K$α$ line emission from Galactic center molecular clouds can be produced either via fluorescence after illumination by an X-ray source or by cosmic ray ionization. Unparalleled high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy obtained by XRISM-Resolve for the galactic center molecular cloud G0.11-0.11 resolves its Fe K$α$ line complex for the first time, and points to a new method for discrimination between the X-ray reflection and cosmic ray ionization models. The Fe K$α$ line complex is resolved into Fe K$α_1$ at $E_{1} = 6.4040 \: \rm{keV}$ and Fe K$α_2$ at $E_{2}= 6.3910 \:\rm{keV}$. Both lines have non-instrumental FWHM of $\approx 3 \:\rm{eV}$, close to the predicted quantum mechanical width of the lines, suggesting scant other sources of line broadening other than instrumental and quantum effects. We measure a radial velocity of $v_{\rm{LSR}} = 50 \pm 12_{fit} \pm 14_{scale} \:\rm{km/s}$ for G0.11-0.11, achieving the same precision reached by radio observations of such clouds.

The absence of the secondary lines argues against the cosmic ray ionization model for G0.11-0.11.

The catalogue combines both absorption agnostic and absorption selected searches, enabling a statistically robust characterization of gas in galaxies at projected separations $D \lesssim 20$ kpc. The GOTOQ emission line ratios indicate that their host galaxies are predominantly normal, star forming disks with typical dust extinctions of $A_V \approx 0.5$ mag. We measure the MgII covering fraction at $D \lesssim 20$ kpc and find it to be remarkably high, $f_c = 98.2^{+1.3}_{-4.5}$ per cent, indicating that these systems trace gas rich, metal enriched regions at the disk halo interface. The median colour excess towards the quasar line of sight, $E(B-V) = 0.087$, is significantly higher than that of typical MgII absorbers, underscoring the dust rich nature of GOTOQ sightlines.

Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\sim30$. While any $z\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at $z\sim30$, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02467v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the exceptionality of exceptional gravitational-wave events</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rodrigo Tenorio, Davide Gerosa<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, 4 figures, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In gravitational-wave astronomy, as in other scientific disciplines, ``exceptional'' sources attract considerable interest because they challenge our current understanding of the underlying (astro)physical processes. Crucially, ``exceptionality'' is defined only relative to the rest of the detected population. For instance, among all gravitational-wave events detected so far, GW231123 is the binary black hole with the largest total mass, while GW241110 is the binary black hole with the most strongly misaligned spin relative to the orbital angular momentum. Mandel [Astrophys.J.Lett. 996 (2026) 1, L4] argued that apparent ``exceptionality'' may reflect measurement error rather than an extreme true value, and suggested that the total mass of GW231123 may be significantly overestimated. Here we present a quantitative analysis that supports this conceptual point. We find that claims of ``exceptionality'' obtained under agnostic priors should be critically questioned whenever measurement uncertainties are comparable to the width of the underlying population. Specifically, we find that the total mass of GW231123 is unlikely to be meaningfully affected by this effect while the spin of GW241110 is far less likely to be anti-aligned than initially claimed: about 70% of realizations that appear to yield an ``exceptionally anti-aligned'' spin are in fact consistent with either nonspinning or aligned configurations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02468v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resonances in b-EMRIs: playing the black hole piano</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> João S.

The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02466v1" target="_blank"><h2>A possible challenge for Cold and Warm Dark Matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

Such objects are dark and thus challenging to characterise, but they can be studied via gravitational lensing. Recently, a million-solar-mass object was discovered superposed on an extended and extremely thin gravitational arc. Here we report on extensive tests of various assumptions for the mass density profile and redshift of this object. We find models that best describe the data have two components: an unresolved point-mass of radius $\leq10$ pc centred on an extended mass distribution with an almost constant surface density out to a truncation radius of 139 pc. These properties do not resemble any known astronomical object. However, if the object is dark matter-dominated, its structure is incompatible with cold dark matter models, but may be compatible with a self-interacting dark matter halo where the central region has collapsed to form a black hole. This detection could thus carry substantial implications for our current understanding of dark matter.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02460v1" target="_blank"><h2>Magnetic reconnection with a 0.1 rate: Effective resistivity in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> B.

Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics (RRMHD) offers the simplest model of reconnection. However, a small uniform resistivity underestimates the reconnection rate compared to first-principles kinetic models. By employing an effective resistivity based on kinetic models - which connects the reconnection electric field to the charge-starved current density - we show that RRMHD can reproduce the increased reconnection rate of kinetic models, both in local current sheets and in global black hole magnetospheres.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02463v1" target="_blank"><h2>Electron temperature relations and the direct N, O, Ne, S and Ar abundances of 49959 star-forming galaxies in DESI Data Release 2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> D.

By directly measuring electron temperatures across multiple ionization zones, we provide constraints on a number of electron temperature relations finding good consistency with previous literature relations. Using these temperature measurements, we derive reliable abundances for N, O, Ne, S and Ar and measure the evolution of abundances and abundance ratios of as a function of metallicity and other galaxy properties. Our measurements include direct oxygen abundances for 49$\,$766 galaxies, leading to the discovery of the two most metal-poor galaxies in the nearby Universe, with oxygen abundances of $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.77_{-0.03}^{+0.03}~\rm dex$ (1.2\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$) and $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.81_{-0.04}^{+0.04}~\rm dex$ (1.3\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$). We identify a rare outlier population of 139 galaxies with high N/O ratios at low metallicity, reminiscent of galaxy abundances observed in the early Universe. We find these high N/O galaxies are more massive than typical galaxies at the same metallicity. We find the Ne/O ratio is constant at low metallicity but increases significantly at $\rm 12+log(O/H) > 8.105\pm0.004$ dex. We show that the S/O and Ar/O abundance ratios are strongly correlated, consistent with the expected additional Type Ia enrichment channel for S and Ar. In this work we present an initial survey of the key properties of the sample, with this dataset serving as a foundation for extensive future work on galaxy abundances at low redshift.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02348v1" target="_blank"><h2>Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE).

Here we present spatial and kinematic relationships between Mg II and O VI as representatives for low and high ion-bearing gas, in the cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation suite FOGGIE, a set of Milky-way-like galaxy simulations with high CGM resolution. We find the O VI-bearing gas exists as a diffuse halo around the galactic disk, while the Mg II-bearing gas is more centrally located. We investigate the covering fraction, probability of co-observation, co-kinematic correspondence of these ions using two different analysis methods. We make both mock sightlines using two-dimensional projections of our simulations treating these cells as integrated lines of sight and we create one-dimensional ray objects and use the SALSA (Boyd et al. 2020) code to investigate individual gas structures that contribute most to the line of sight column densities, which we call mock absorbers. We explore the relative kinematics of these mock absorbers and find Mg II and O VI appear to have a co-kinematic relationship when looking at absorber pairs with the closest relative velocity like in Werk et al. (2016). However, this does not necessarily correspond with a close spatial separation meaning many O VI and Mg II absorber pairs only appear to be co-kinematic but are physically unrelated. Taking a more holistic look at Mg II and O VI absorber pairs reveals a much weaker correlation between these two ions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02336v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Sequential Monte Carlo goes NUTS: Boosting Gravitational-Wave Inference</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gabriele Demasi, Giulia Capurri, Massimo Lenti, Angelo Ricciardone, Barbara Patricelli, Adriano Frattale Mascioli, Lorenzo Piccari, Saulo Albuquerque, Gianluca M.

At the same time, gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, most notably the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), provide an efficient way to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work we present SHARPy, a Bayesian inference framework that combines the parallelism and evidence-estimation capabilities of SMC with the state-of-the-art sampling performance of NUTS. Moreover, SHARPy exploits the local geometric structure of the posterior to further improve efficiency. Built on JAX and accelerated on GPUs, SHARPy performs gravitational-wave inference on binary black-hole events in around ten minutes, yielding posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates that are consistent with those obtained through Nested Sampling. This work sets a new milestone in GW inference with likelihood-based methods and paves the way for model comparison tasks to be accomplished in minutes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02297v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Polarization and Magnetic Field of the Radio Arc as Observed by ALMA at 100 GHz</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nora Salem, Dylan M.

The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02287v1" target="_blank"><h2>A comprehensive search for high-velocity X-ray sources: New compact object binary candidates in the Gaia era</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yue Zhao, Poshak Gandhi, Christian Knigge, Phil Charles, Daniel Stern, Peter Boorman, Pornisara Nuchvanichakul, Cordelia Dashwood Brown, David A.

We cross-match X-ray points sources from a variety of catalogues (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift and eROSITA) with Gaia DR3. Using Gaia coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions, we compute peculiar velocities ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$) relative to Galactic disc rotation. Remaining agnostic about radial velocities (RVs), we vary RVs to find the minimum possible $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ values ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$). Uncertainties on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$ are estimated via Monte Carlo resampling, and we select X-ray sources that have $1\,σ$ lower limits on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}\geq 200\,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and high $F_\mathrm{X}/F_\mathrm{G}$ values. We show that this velocity threshold excludes most contaminants (e.g., cataclysmic variables and active binaries) while retaining a sensible fraction of compact object binaries, demonstrating that $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ could serve as an effective indicator for the presence of a neutron star or black hole companion. Our selection yields a sample of 2372 sources, from which we construct a gold sample of 7 sources that have relatively well-constrained astrometry and confident optical counterparts. Follow-up is necessary to confirm and characterise their high-energy emission, as well as a Galactic disc vs. halo origin.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02284v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quintom Dark Energy: Future Attractor and Phantom Crossing in Light of DESI DR2 Observation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Phusuda Thanankullaphong, Prasanta Sahoo, Prajwal Hassan Puttasiddappa, Nandan Roy<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a two-field dark energy model consisting of a canonical quintessence scalar field and a phantom scalar field in a spatially flat FLRW universe. The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02269v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JWST EXCELS survey: Outflows in 1.5 < z < 5 quiescent galaxies are likely relics from episodic AGN activity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elizabeth Taylor, Adam C.

NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from $\approx$ 300 - 1200 kms$^{-1}$, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched $\lt$ 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\simeq$ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to $\simeq$ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a $\simeq$ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02220v1" target="_blank"><h2>The NIRISS PASSAGE Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog in COSMOS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mason S.

PASSAGE is a JWST Cycle 1 Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) pure-parallel survey, obtaining near-infrared spectra of thousands of extragalactic sources. 15 out of 63 PASSAGE fields fall within the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) COSMOS footprint, of which 11 overlap with COSMOS-Web, a JWST treasury survey providing additional space-based photometry. We present our custom line-finding algorithm and visual inspection effort used to identify emission lines and derive the spectroscopic redshifts for line-emitting sources in PASSAGE. The line-finding algorithm identifies between ~200 and 950 line-emitting candidates per field, of which typically 47% were identified as true emission lines post visual inspection. We identify 2183 emission line sources at 0.08<z<4.7, 1896 of which have available COSMOS photometric redshifts. We find excellent redshift agreement between the COSMOS photometric redshifts and the PASSAGE spectroscopic redshifts for strong (S/N>5), multi-line emitting sources. This agreement weakens for PASSAGE single-line emitters with ambiguous identities. These single-line emitters are likely mis-identified around 18% of the time based on comparisons to photometric redshifts. We derive stellar masses using PASSAGE photometry and spectroscopic redshifts, in broad agreement with existing COSMOS-Web stellar masses, but with some discrepancy driven by redshift disagreements. We publicly release this spectroscopic redshift catalog, which will enable community-led science in prime extragalactic fields and serve as a crucial dataset for validating Euclid and Roman spectroscopy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02115v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resonant Photon-Axion Mixing Driven by Dark Matter Oscillations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Run-Min Yao, Xiao-Jun Bi, Peng-Fei Yin, Qing-Guo Huang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6+8 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Wave propagation in a coherently oscillating background is intrinsically a periodically driven problem. We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $Δ_γ- Δ_a \approx n m_a$ ($n \in \mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $Δ_γ\approx Δ_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02104v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kandaswamy Subramanian, Bikram Phookun<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 Pages, Submitted to PRD<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), high redshift (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02077v1" target="_blank"><h2>Joint Constraints on Neutrinos and Dynamical Dark Energy in Minimally Modified Gravity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Artur Ladeira, Rafael C.

In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \(\sum m_ν< 0.11~\mathrm{eV}\) (95\% CL) and \(N_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \(H_0\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02074v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nonlinear Scales in Luminal Horndeski -- I.

Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02005v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: Improving redshift distribution reconstruction using a deep-to-wide transfer function</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Y.

Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01999v1" target="_blank"><h2>Proton Acceleration by Collisionless Shocks in Supermassive Black Hole Coronae: Implications for High-Energy Neutrinos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Minh Nhat Ly, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Yasuhiko Sentoku, Takayoshi Sano<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, physics.plasm-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 11 figure; submitted for publication<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01991v1" target="_blank"><h2>ODIN: Clustering Properties of Ly$α$ Blobs at $z$ $\sim$ 2.4 and 3.1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Byeongha Moon, Yujin Yang, Eric Gawiser, Kyoung-Soo Lee, Danisbel Herrera, Vandana Ramakrishnan, Nelson Padilla, Nicole M.

However, their dark matter halo properties (e.g., halo mass) are still uncertain due to their rarity and strong field-to-field variation. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey has discovered 103 and 112 LABs in the extended ($\sim$9~\sqdeg) COSMOS field at $z\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively, enabling estimation of their bias and host halo masses through clustering analysis. We measure the angular auto-correlation functions (ACFs) of LABs and derive galaxy bias factors of $b$ = $4.0\pm0.8$ and $3.8\pm0.7$, corresponding to minimum halo masses of $2.8^{+3.0}_{-1.8}$ and $0.7^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{12}~M_\odot$ and median halo masses of $4.2^{+3.8}_{-2.5}$ and $1.1^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\times10^{12}~M_\odot$ at $z\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively.

The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01938v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Dilaton: A Natural Resolution to the Hubble Tension via Spontaneous Scale Symmetry Breaking</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Arpit Kottur, Jui Mahajan, Raka Dabhade<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 3 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The statistical tension between early and late universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) suggests that the dark sector is dynamical rather than static. We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($χ$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ''thawing'' exponential potential $V(φ) \propto e^{-λφ}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $λ\approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $ξ\approx 7.8 \times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01867v1" target="_blank"><h2>How our proto-nuclear star cluster formed and grew due to early globular cluster disruption.

For the dynamical modelling, we used the updated parallel N-body code phi-GPU, including stellar evolution. We prepared three sets of GC models with different half-mass radii (r_hm), each consisting of 50 full N-body GC models, and integrated these models in an external, time-variable MW-like potential taken from the cosmological database IllustrisTNG-100. The simulations cover the time interval from -10 Gyr to -5 Gyr, enabling us to assess the rate of early stellar accretion onto the proto-NSC. We find that GC models with average orbital eccentricities of 0.4-0.5 and orbits oriented perpendicular to the galactic disc contribute most significantly to the mass of the proto-NSC formation. Accretion is especially efficient in the first billion years and in compact GC models with r_hm = 1 pc. In all sets, the dominant accreted stellar population consists of low-mass stars (~0.33 Msun). However, the accreted mass alone is insufficient to fully account for the current NSC mass. Based on our extended set of numerical simulations, we obtained an average lower limit of mass contribution (~6 percent) to the NSC from investigated GCs. The fraction of mass contribution from individual disrupted GCs can significantly vary from 0.1 percent up to 90 percent. Generally, we conclude that the GC stellar accretion channel alone might not be sufficient to ensure the present-day MW galaxy NSC mass budget.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01763v1" target="_blank"><h2>When the Shadow Meets Its Measure: Assessing the Feasibility of Submillimeter Black Hole Shadow Imaging in Megamaser Disk AGN</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Roman Burridge, Geoffrey C.

In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01748v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the interplay between molecular and ionized gas in HII regions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

In addition, we investigate the interplay between ionized gas, molecular gas, and dust to probe how massive stars influence their parental clumps. We observed the $J_{K_aK_c}$ transitions of para-H2CO (within its J = 3-2 and 4-3 states) with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) 12 m submillimeter telescope using the nFLASH230 and SEPIA345 receivers towards a sample of 61 HII regions. Spectral line parameters are derived via multi-component Gaussian fitting, which was then used to constrain the physical conditions determined using PyRADEX, a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer code in combination with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The non-LTE analysis yielded kinetic temperatures ($T_{kin}$) ranging from 33.7 K to 265 K and H2 densities (n(H$_2$)) between 0.8 X $10^4$ to 1.05 X $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$, providing a detailed characterization of the dense molecular gas contained in these clumps. In addition to the para-H$_2$CO emission arising from the targeted clump a large fraction (57%) of the sources exhibit multiple para-H$_2$CO components, with the secondary components being characterized by higher $T_{kin}$ and broader linewidths. Investigating the nature of the secondary component revealed its association with supersonic non-thermal motions and turbulent gas. When comparing the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust components with those of the ionizing gas, we find that parameters directly linked to the central high-mass star such as bolometric luminosity and Lyman continuum photon rate, show stronger and more systematic correlations.

The deep medium-resolution spectrum enables the measurement of its stellar velocity dispersion ($σ_\star = 95_{-33}^{+38}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$), the smallest value recorded among spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$. Coupled with a compact size ($0.41\pm0.03\, {\rm kpc}$), it yields a dynamical mass estimate of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot)=9.75_{-0.38}^{+0.29}$. Its star formation history suggests that half of the stellar mass was in place $\sim1\,{\rm Gyr}$ before the observed epoch, with quenching occurring $\sim0.2\,{\rm Gyr}$ prior to $z=2.08$. These results confirm that AURORA-LQG1 is genuinely quenched, rather than in a temporary phase of suppressed star formation rate. AURORA-LQG1 is consistent with the mass fundamental plane at $z\sim2$, previously constrained only by massive quiescent systems. Compared with more massive counterparts at the same epoch observed with NIRSpec grating spectroscopy, the time since quenching for AURORA-LQG1 is among the shortest observed. The galaxy resides in a possible dense group-scale ($\sim50$ kpc) environment containing one companion with tentative spectroscopic redshift and five companion candidates, and it is embedded in a known protocluster on Mpc scales. A potential environmental influence on its evolution could explain the outside-in quenching suggested by the positive gradient of size with wavelength. This study demonstrates that deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy enables low-mass quiescent galaxies at Cosmic Noon to be characterized with a level of detail long reserved for massive systems, offering valuable new insights into how quenching operates in these underexplored low-mass systems.

Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at $z = 10.6$ reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{10.12} M_{\odot}$) than their counterparts at $z = 5.5$ ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{11.45} M_{\odot}$), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values ($b_{\rm{g}}^{\rm{eff}} = 8.13^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ compared to $5.64^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching $<1\%$ by $z \sim 5-6$. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization.

The transformation scales the lens mass distribution and superposes a uniform mass sheet, but this formulation offers no clear physical interpretation. Here I show that the MST follows directly from a scaling symmetry that becomes apparent when the ray-trace relation is written in proper-distance coordinates. In this form, the ray-trace relation isolates a geometric focusing term. Subtracting this term from the deflection law defines the Image-Selection Relation (ISR), which determines image positions, magnifications, and differential time delays. The ISR exhibits a scaling symmetry that leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays. Restoring the geometric focusing term then gives a ray-trace relation related to the original one by the Mass-Sheet Transformation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01597v1" target="_blank"><h2>The effects of star-gas interactions on binary evolution in open clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jixuan Yang, Lile Wang, Xinyu Li, Meng Sun, Rainer Spurzem<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 13 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), feedback (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Star-gas interactions can provide gravitational feedback that influences the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters, through processes such as dynamical friction (DF) and its non-dissipative counterpart, negative dynamical friction (NDF). Using the \texttt{PeTar} code, we perform direct $N$-body simulations of an open cluster initially containing $10^4$ stars, evolving within a gaseous medium spanning a range of ambient densities. Our results demonstrate that NDF associated with stellar outflows interacting with the surrounding gas can enhance the rate of cluster expansion, preferentially transporting stars toward the cluster outskirts. This behavior is accompanied by a more rapid decline in the number of binaries composed of a neutron star and a main-sequence star. A statistical analysis of binary orbital parameters further indicates that, compared to DF-dominated evolution, NDF tends to retain systems with larger semi-major axes and lower eccentricities. Outflow-ambient gas interactions can modify the dynamical processing of binaries in star clusters, leading to changes in the survival fraction and composition of the remaining binary population.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01586v1" target="_blank"><h2>Statistical analysis of multi-band plateaus in gamma-ray burst afterglows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiao-Yan Li, Tong Liu, Bao-Quan Huang, Chen Deng<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Plateau features are frequently observed in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), yet their physical origins remain under debate. In this work, we compile a sample of 124 GRBs with known redshifts and simultaneous X-ray and optical afterglow observations. We categorize them into four subsets based on the existence of plateaus and the bands in which they appear. Namely, Dataset 1: plateaus are detected simultaneously in both X-ray and optical bands (75 bursts); Dataset 2: plateaus are only in X-rays (15 bursts); Dataset 3: plateaus appear only in the optical (17 bursts); Dataset 4: no plateaus in either band (17 bursts). We employ these datasets to test the applicability of the energy-injection model by examining whether the temporal decay index $α$ and the spectral index $β$ of GRB afterglows simultaneously satisfy the closure relations in X-ray and optical bands. We find that 47 bursts of Dataset 1 simultaneously obey the closure relations in both bands under the conditions of the electron spectral index $p>2$ and the injection parameter $q\in (0, 0.5)$, and 69 of the dataset for $p>1$ and $q\in (0, 0.8)$, providing a strong support for the energy-injection interpretation. However, for Datasets 2 and 3, although $α$ and $β$ of the plateaus mostly satisfy the closure relations, those in the other band show significant deviations, which implies that bursts with a single-band plateau are inconsistent with the interpretation of energy injection. Furthermore, we also compare the isotropic X-ray energy of plateaus with the rotational energy budget of millisecond magnetars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01563v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detection of giant pulses from the transitional millisecond pulsar J1227$-$4853</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Saptarshi Sarkar, Jayanta Roy, Bhaswati Bhattacharyya, Paul Ray, Sanjay Kudale, Paulo Freire, Patrick Weltevrede, Matthew Kerr<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 6 figures.

This marks the first detection of GPs from a transitional MSP and adds to the small number of millisecond pulsars known to exhibit such extreme variability. A total of 235 GPs were detected across observations at 550-750 MHz, with widths as narrow as $1.28~μs$ and flux densities up to $\sim 10^4$ times the pulsar's mean flux density. The GPs are strongly localized in pulse phase, originating predominantly from the second and third main-pulse components, and are absent in the inter-pulse region. The arrival times of the GPs deviate significantly from Poisson statistics, with the waiting-time distribution well described by a Weibull model having a shape parameter of $k = 0.30$, indicative of strong temporal clustering. During an epoch of enhanced activity, the GP rate increased by nearly two orders of magnitude to $124~\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, with a corresponding shape parameter of $k = 0.47$.

We identified 21 such objects by crossmatching a ULX catalog with the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). They may have a diverse population. (i) Three have a double lobed radio structure with a compact core found in two of them, and could be quasars. (ii) Five are associated with extended radio structure and star forming regions in optical, where the radio emission is likely due to star forming activities, although the steep radio spectrum up to several GHz casts doubt on that. Two of them show X-ray variability suggesting that they are ULXs embedded in star forming regions. (iii) Thirteen are associated with an unresolved radio source, with a steep spectrum seen in eight, a flat or inverted spectrum seen in two. Those with a steep spectrum are arguably candidates for SS 433/W50 like objects, with radio emission due to optically thin synchrotron radiation in a surrounding jet/wind powered nebula. Remarkable cases include NGC 925 ULX1 and NGC 6946 ULX1, which are associated with an optical nebula. Those with a flat or inverted spectrum could be accreting black holes with a compact jet, while the black hole mass is estimated to be several $10^6 - 10^8$ $M_\odot$ based on the fundamental plane. Redshift measurements are needed to firmly determine the association with their apparent host galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01533v1" target="_blank"><h2>Diffuse neutrino flux from relativistic reconnection in AGN coronae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> D.

Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $σ_{\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\sim$10\% of the AGN coronae have $σ_{\rm p} \sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations. Coronal emission is suppressed at higher energies by pion and muon cooling, so that another population is required, with jetted AGN being strong candidates.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01525v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cracks in the Standard Cosmological Model: Anomalies, Tensions, and Hints of New Physics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eleonora Di Valentino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Proceedings for the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmology has entered an era of unprecedented precision, yet increasing accuracy has revealed cracks in the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm. Although the model remains highly successful when confronted with individual datasets, joint analyses expose a network of tensions involving the Hubble constant, CMB lensing, curvature, neutrino masses, and the nature of dark energy. In this contribution to the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106), within the context of Working Group~2, we critically assess these discrepancies, emphasizing the role of model assumptions, parameter degeneracies, and dataset consistency. We review proposed early- and late-time solutions, discuss how recent DESI BAO results alter the viability of late-time extensions, and explore interacting dark-sector scenarios.

Archival XMM-Newton observations of 12 active galactic nuclei were analyzed to constrain properties of these absorbers. Our analysis demonstrates that the soft X-ray variability is primarily governed by fluctuation of the partial covering fraction of mildly ionized clumpy clouds. In particular, for Mrk 335, PDS 456, and 1H 0707-495, outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are constrained from the blue-shifts of the Fe-L edge structure. The blue-shifted Fe-L edge successfully reproduces the well-known complex spectral feature near 1 keV in 1H 0707--495, which was often explained by invoking an ad hoc absorption structure. Notably, the inferred outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are comparable to, or even exceed, those associated with the Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the outflow velocities and the intrinsic X-ray fluxes in two of four data sets, and the remaining two datasets also agree with this positive correlation, which supports a radiative-driven wind scenario that the X-ray/UV emission from the central black holes is causing the UFOs and the outflowing clumpy absorbers. In addition, the line-driven acceleration is likely playing a significant role, since the line opacities of the clumpy absorbers are highly sensitive to the flux changes. These findings provide a robust observational support for the ``hot inner and clumpy outer wind'' paradigm, suggesting a common origin for both the UFOs and the clumpy absorbers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01402v1" target="_blank"><h2>Binary neutron star mergers with SPHINCS_BSSN: temperature-dependent equations of state and damping of constraint violations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bhaskar Biswas, Stephan Rosswog, Peter Diener, Lukas Schnabel<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc, nucl-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 14 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Neutron star mergers hold the key to several grand challenges of contemporary (astro-)physics.

We introduce here a substantial update of our Lagrangian numerical relativity code SPHINCS_BSSN. Apart from changing our unit system, we add constraint damping terms to the BSSN spacetime evolution equations. We demonstrate that this measure reduces, without noteworthy computational cost, the Hamiltonian constraint violations by more than an order of magnitude. We further implement contributions to thermal energy and pressure that are based on Fermi liquid theory and contain a parametrization of the Dirac effective mass. These terms can be combined with any cold equation of state, and they enhance the physical realism of our simulations and introduce a physics-based concept of a temperature. In a set of merger simulations, we demonstrate good agreement with other temperature-dependent numerical relativity simulations.

This approach incorporates complexities such as the three-dimensional DM distribution, spatially varying radiation and magnetic fields, and electron transport mechanisms like Galactic winds and diffusion. We assess the impact of these environmental factors on both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the resulting secondary emissions.

In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework utilizing a ResNet-50 encoder pre-trained via supervised contrastive learning to classify CCSN signals and distinguish them from instrumental noise artifacts. Our approach explicitly optimizes the feature space to maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Using a simulated four-detector network (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA) and realistic datasets injecting magnetorotational and neutrino-driven waveforms, we demonstrate that the contrastive learning paradigm establishes a superior metric structure within the embedding space, significantly enhancing detection efficiency. At a false positive rate of $10^{-4}$, our method achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of nearly $100\%$ for both rotational and neutrino-driven signals within a distance range of $10$--$200$~kpc, while maintaining a TPR of approximately $80\%$ at $1200$~kpc. In contrast, traditional end-to-end methods yield a TPR below $20\%$ for rotational signals at distances $\geq 200$~kpc, and fail to exceed $60\%$ for neutrino-driven signals even at a close proximity of $10$~kpc.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01340v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hao Xu, Xinhe Meng<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = w_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from "standard" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $Λ$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01230v1" target="_blank"><h2>Time-delay and lens galaxy redshift in the doubly imaged quasar PS J2305+3714</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> O.

From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $λ$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $Λ$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01169v1" target="_blank"><h2>One-dimensional PIC Simulation of Induced Compton Scattering in Magnetized Electron-Positron Pair Plasma</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shoma F.

In this system, two distinct modes of density fluctuations, referred to as the charged mode and the neutral mode, are theoretically expected to arise through parametric instabilities. Our simulations confirm these predictions: in the charged mode, the electron and positron densities fluctuate oppositely (Langmuir-like), while in the neutral mode, the charge is Debye-screened and both species fluctuate in phase (acoustic-like). The linear growth rates obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with analytical estimates for both modes. We also find that, in some cases, the linear growth saturates before full scattering occurs, allowing the incident wave to propagate without significant attenuation. Our results allow us to determine whether induced Compton scattering grows linearly in magnetized pair plasmas, offering a foundation for studies of fast radio bursts and laser-plasma experiments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01138v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fluctuation dynamos in supersonic turbulence at ${\rm Pm} \gtrsim 1$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ameya Uday Nagdeo, Sharanya Sur, Bhargav Vaidya<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fluctuation dynamos provide a robust mechanism for amplifying weak seed magnetic fields in turbulent astrophysical plasmas. However, their behaviour in the highly compressible regimes characteristic of the interstellar medium (ISM) remains incompletely understood. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supersonic turbulence with rms Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} \approx 11$, we explore fluctuation dynamos across magnetic Prandtl numbers ${\rm Pm} = 1-10$. At ${\rm Pm} = 1$, dynamo growth is slower and saturates at lower magnetic-to-kinetic energy ratios, with amplification in the kinematic phase dominated by compression rather than line stretching. In contrast, at ${\rm Pm} = 10$, vortical stretching emerges as the dominant mechanism, yielding faster growth, higher saturation levels, and stronger suppression of density-magnetic field correlations by magnetic pressure. This transition is reflected in the correlation coefficient between density and magnetic field strength, which is strongly positive at ${\rm Pm} = 1$ but decreases significantly at higher ${\rm Pm}$. Across all runs, the ratio of velocity-to-magnetic integral scales is $\sim 3.4$, independent of ${\rm Pm}$, while the ratio of viscous to resistive dissipation scales increase with the increase in ${\rm Pm}$. Synthetic Faraday rotation measures (RM) reveal coherence lengths of $\sim (1/4-1/3)$ of the forcing scale across the range of ${\rm Pm}$ explored. Using these coherence scales, we discuss the potential contribution of fluctuation dynamos to Faraday rotation expected from turbulent, gas rich young disk galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02416v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial Black Hole Formation in $f(R)=R+αR^2$ Gravity: Perturbative and Non-Perturbative Analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> G.

We explore the metal abundances and chemical enrichment in the cool-core galaxy cluster, Ophiuchus, by using a 217 ks XRISM data set. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni are accurately determined using high-resolution spectroscopy. We find that the average uncertainties of chemical composition, which are reported as X/Fe ratios, are only 10-20%. The X/Fe abundance pattern of the Ophiuchus centre is remarkably consistent with solar, which is reminiscent of the Hitomi constraint on the Perseus core. The observed abundance pattern can be replicated globally by linear combination models of core-collapse, including massive progenitors, and Type Ia supernovae.

Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $Λ$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ is constrained to be $\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\%$ confidence level.

The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate.

We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((ω/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $κ$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00960v1" target="_blank"><h2>GA-NIFS: AGN activity in a Lyα emitter within a triple-AGN system anchored by a passive galaxy at z=3</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Michele Perna, Santiago Arribas, Mahmoud Hamed, Francesco D'Eugenio, J.

The quiescent galaxy GS10578 at z=3.1 is a key example of this population. Previous JWST/NIRSpec IFU data revealed an AGN outflow and uncovered a compact pair of AGN separated by ~5 kpc. In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of ~30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00959v1" target="_blank"><h2>Widespread Extended [CII] Emission in High-Redshift Galaxies: Insights from the FIRE-2 Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lun-Jun Liu, Guochao Sun, Andreas L.

These measurements provide new insights into high-redshift galactic ecosystems and processes that drive metal enrichment on circumgalactic scales. To better understand the nature of [CII] halos, we analyze a suite of high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations at $5 \leq z \leq 6$ in the stellar mass range of $10^{9}$--$10^{10.5}\,M_{\odot}$. By post-processing these simulations with three-dimensional dust radiative transfer and photoionization modeling, we generate synthetic images of [CII] and UV continuum emission, from which we extract one-dimensional surface brightness profiles. Our results reproduce both the galaxy-integrated and spatial distribution of [CII] and UV emission, capturing in particular the more extended profile of [CII] emission. Comparing the time evolution of [CII] halos with bursty star formation histories of the simulated galaxies, we find that [CII] emission becomes more spatially extended following the decline of star formation rate in recent starburst episodes. This implies a strong correlation between extended [CII] emission and bursty star formation, consistent with a key role for star formation-driven outflows in producing [CII] halos -- though the kinematics of [CII]-emitting gas suggest that inflows and turbulent motions are also significant contributors. We also find a modest contribution from satellite galaxies to extended [CII] emission. Our framework can be readily applied to predict the observability of [CII] halos at higher redshifts and extended to create spatially resolved synthetic observations of other important emission lines, such as [OIII] and H$α$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00956v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inflight performance and future improvements for the INtegral Field Ultraviolet Spectrographic Experiment, the first far ultraviolet integral field spectrograph</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alex Haughton, Emily M.

Ultra heavy ions ($Z \gg 26$) can be accelerated to cosmic ray energies by the reverse shock as the ejecta decelerates by interacting with the ambient environment. We investigate the contribution of magnetars to the local ultra heavy cosmic ray flux using semi-analytic Galactic transport calculations, demonstrating that they may be significant contributors throughout Galactic history depending on the giant flare rate and ion acceleration efficiency. Although neutron star mergers inject orders of magnitude more energy into cosmic rays, they rarely occur within the spallation-limited propagation horizon for ultra heavy species, reducing their local contributions. As compared to lighter nuclei which are dominantly accelerated by supernovae, the SuperTIGER experiment has presented tentative evidence for a distinct contribution to the cosmic ray abundances near and above the first $r$-process peak ($Z \approx 35\text{--}56$). We argue that current abundance data are consistent with either a magnetar giant flare or neutron star merger origin for these species. Measurements with single element resolution through the third $r$-process peak, expected from the upcoming TIGERISS experiment, may discriminate between these sources for the heaviest cosmic rays.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00952v1" target="_blank"><h2>On Cosmological Correlators at One Loop</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guilherme L.

As benchmark examples, we analyse the bubble and triangle diagrams. The bubble exhibits a UV divergence that can be removed by a local counterterm, while the triangle yields a finite result, which we evaluate explicitly in terms of dilogarithms using an integral transform for the Laplacian Green's function. We classify the kinematic singularities of these diagrams using Landau analysis, identifying novel types of singular behaviour, and validate this analysis against the explicit results.

The LMC:Milky Way (MW) interaction is also $\sim$1:10, and is expected to perturb the MW's DM distribution. However, no framework exists to quantify the severity of these perturbations over multiple pericenters and longer periods of time, such as the LMC-SMC interaction history. We construct basis function expansions of a high-resolution N-body simulation of the Clouds interacting in isolation and analyze their DM distributions at an epoch approximating the time of infall to the MW. Our goal is to quantify how the Clouds distort each other's DM distributions without the MW. The LMC halo's response to the SMC includes a $\sim 20$ kpc-long dynamical friction wake and the displacement of the LMC's density center during each SMC pericenter, which produces two overdensities in the LMC halo (at $\sim$60 and $\sim$100 kpc) at MW infall. The SMC's tidal radius at infall is just $\sim4$ kpc, at which point the SMC has lost two-thirds of its initial DM mass to the LMC. The distortions to the Clouds' halos produce a highly asymmetric acceleration field. Accurate orbit integration in the LMC-SMC system must account for the time-dependent shapes of both halos. The SMC-induced perturbations in the LMC DM halo resemble the MW-LMC system, and persist over multiple SMC pericenters. We conclude that 1:10 satellite:host encounters induce characteristic deformations in both DM halos across all host mass scales, with implications for merger rates and tests of DM models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00947v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Emission and Suppression of Line Features in Luminous Transients</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Olivia Aspegren, Daniel Kasen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 12 figures; submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Featureless optical and ultraviolet (UV) spectra are a puzzling signature to emerge from recent observations of luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and some tidal disruption events (TDEs). We describe the landscape of source and gas properties that are expected to form H, He I and He II emission lines, and map spectral types to the parameter space of luminosity and system radius. Using one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we show that high source luminosities ($L > 10^{44}\,\rm erg~s^{-1}$) and compact ejecta radii ($r < 10^{14}\,\rm cm$) produce featureless spectra due to the high temperature and ionization state of the emitting medium. Intermediate luminosities and moderately compact systems can generate He II-dominated spectra, while lower luminosities and more extended atmospheres result in conspicuous H and He I emission. Large expansion velocities ($v \geq 0.1c$) can further broaden lines such that they blend into the continuum. Featureless UV spectra may require even more extreme ionization conditions or velocities to suppress the many intrinsically strong metal lines at those wavelengths. Applying this framework to understand the absence of features observed in LFBOTs and featureless TDEs, we find that non-homologous, compact outflows are likely necessary for featurelessness to persist in optical and UV spectra.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00795v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM finds the Changing-Look AGN NGC 1365 in an extended low state: A dense, highly ionized outflow obscures the central source</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fatima Zaidouni, Erin Kara, Peter Kosec, Ehud Behar, Richard Mushotzky, Michael Koss, Anna Juráňová, Elias Kammoun, Laura W.

NGC 1365 is known for rapid transitions between Compton-thick and Compton-thin states, along with strong absorption from a highly ionized wind. During our observations, the source is found in a persistent low-flux state, characterized by a decrease in hard-X-ray luminosity and significant line-of-sight obscuration. In this state, XRISM/Resolve reveals clear Fe\,\textsc{xxv} and Fe\,\textsc{xxvi} absorption lines together with, for the first time in this source, corresponding emission lines. These features may arise either from reemission from a photoionized wind (P Cygni profile) or from collisionally ionized gas associated with outflow-driven shocks in the interstellar medium. We estimate the wind launch radius to be approximately $10^{16}~\mathrm{cm}$ ($\sim 10^4 R_{\mathrm{g}}$), consistent with the location of the X-ray broad-line region. We also resolve a broadened Fe K$α$ line by $σ\sim 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ placing it at similar scales to the wind, consistent with radii inferred from disk-broadening models and the variability of the Fe K$α$ broad line. The similarity of the Fe K$α$ profile to the H$β$ wing and broad Pa$α$ width indicates that the X-ray-emitting region is likely cospatial with the optical/IR broad-line region and originates from the same gas.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00767v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Dark Energy Imprints in the Lyman-Alpha Forest</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Diego Garza, Brant Robertson, Piero Madau, Nick Gnedin, Matthew W.

By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00741v1" target="_blank"><h2>Eccentric Disks from Circumbinary Rings</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Leonardo Betancourt, Andrew MacFadyen, Jonathan Zrake<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We perform high-resolution, grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of finite gaseous circumbinary rings (CBRs) viscously spreading into disks around binaries.

Smaller rings relax into disks with enhanced gas eccentricity up to $e\simeq 0.3$. We consider the possibility that inefficiently-accreting, intermediate-mass ($\sim10^4 M_\odot$) black hole binaries may be sources of quasi-periodic eruptions when rejected streams shock the cavity wall and radiate in the UV or soft X-ray.

They therefore serve as excellent tracers for the local physical and chemical properties of these environments. Proper models that are capable of grasping the formation and destruction of COMs are crucial to understanding observations. However, given that distinct COMs may be detected from different locations and at varying times, we improve UCLCHEM - a gas-grain chemical code - to a one-dimensional, time-dependent model, tailored to protostars. In this update, we examine two stages of a protostar: the prestellar and heating stages, incorporating a simple radiative mechanism for both the internal and external radiation fields of the cloud. This approach relies on the key assumption that the dust and gas temperatures are completely coupled. Ultimately, we implement an updated version of our model to interpret observations obtained through both single-dish and interferometry under varying conditions, including a SgrB2(N1) hot core, massive Galactic clumps and a hot core in Orion. We show that our model could reproduce these observations well, highlighting that some COMs are positioned at a higher temperature in the envelope, whereas others are from the lower temperature, potentially leading to misinterpretation when using a single-point model. In a particular case of SgrB2(N1), the best model indicates that the cosmic-ray ionisation rate significantly exceeds the value typically used for the standard interstellar medium. Our model shows as an efficient computational tool particularly useful for better insights into observations of COMs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00692v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hadronic Origin of Sub-PeV Gamma-Ray Emission from LHAASO J0621+3755</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sonali Sahoo, Ankan Roy, Kritika Yadav, Reetanjali Moharana<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $η_p\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity.

Morphology population studies on X-ray selected clusters will be biased without taking into account selection, as cool cores are more easily detected at low redshifts, but can be mistaken for point sources at high redshift. eROSITA, aboard SRG, found over 12000 optically-identified clusters in its first survey, eRASS1. Taking account of the selection function obtained from simulations, we obtain using a Bayesian framework the intrinsic distribution of morphological parameters, including the concentration, central density, cuspiness, ellipticity and slosh. We construct scaling relations for the parameters as a function of redshift (z) and luminosity (LX), and study their distribution within z or LX bins. We find that the concentration in a scaled aperture evolves positively with LX, similarly to the central scaled density, and negatively with z. When using a fixed aperture, its evolution with LX is lower, but also dependent on the choice of cluster centre. The mean ellipticity does not significantly evolve with z or LX. eRASS1 clusters show indications of higher concentrations compared to SZ-selected objects, even after taking account the selection; this suggests that if our X-ray selection model is correct SZ-selected clusters may also suffer from morphological selection effects. We compare different parameter distribution models in bins of z and LX. The distribution of concentration and ellipticity is generally consistent with a normal one, but other parameters such as the central density and cuspiness strongly favour more complex distributions. However, modelling of all clusters as a single population generally prefers non-normal distributions.

We found that the AGN fraction decreases as a function of void-centric distance, with void galaxies displaying the highest AGN fraction (12\%), and galaxies in denser environments, showing the lowest AGN fraction (6.7\%), consistent with observations. The AGN fraction is particularly high in most massive void galaxies when controlling for stellar mass.
  When comparing AGN host galaxies to inactive ones, we find that AGN galaxies tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs, higher specific star formation rates, and reside in higher-mass haloes at a given stellar mass than non-AGN galaxies. At $\rm M_{*} > \rm 10^{10.2} \rm M_{\odot}$, AGN hosts in voids tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs than those in denser environments. Otherwise, the AGN population does not show a clear trend in relation to the global environment. In contrast, non-AGN void galaxies host more massive SMBHs, slightly higher sSFRs, and are located in more massive haloes than those in denser environments. Analysing the recent merger histories of both AGN and non-AGN populations, we find that a larger fraction of massive AGN galaxies have undergone major mergers compared to non-AGN galaxies, regardless of environment. Notably, AGN galaxies in voids show a higher frequency of recent mergers, especially major mergers, than their counterparts in other environments, especially at high stellar mass.
  Our results suggest that the evolution of SMBHs in voids is closely related to that of their host galaxies and their surrounding environment, while the most recent AGN activity is more strongly linked to recent interactions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00522v1" target="_blank"><h2>A New Empirical Fit to Galaxy Rotation Curves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> David C.

Unlike parametric halo models or modified gravity theories, this approach does not alter Newtonian dynamics or invoke dark matter distributions. Instead, it identifies a repeatable kinematic offset that aligns with observed rotation profiles across a wide range of galaxies. Using SPARC data [1], we demonstrate that this model consistently achieves high fidelity fits, often outperforming MOND and CDM halo models in RMSE and R-squared metrics without parametric tuning. The method is reproducible, minimally dependent on mass modeling, and offers a streamlined alternative for characterizing galactic dynamics. While the velocity correction ω lacks a definitive physical interpretation, its empirical success invites further exploration. We position this model as a local kinematic tool rather than a cosmological framework, and we welcome dialogue on its implications for galactic structure and gravitational theory. Appendix B presents RMSE and R2 comparisons showing that this method consistently outperforms MOND and CDM halo models across a representative galaxy sample.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00495v1" target="_blank"><h2>Late-Time Resolution of the Hubble Tension in CPL Cosmology with Massive Neutrinos via Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Muhammad Yarahmadi, Amin Salehi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 7figure<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the Hubble constant within the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on the standard $Λ$CDM model and its dynamical dark energy extensions described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, both with and without massive neutrinos. By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $Λ$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $Σm_ν$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\sim1$-$2σ$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00443v1" target="_blank"><h2>Late Time Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Scalar Dark Matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> V.

Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00437v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low Metallicity Gas on the Outskirts of the Local Group: the Circumgalactic Medium of Sextans B</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrew J.

Using HST/COS spectroscopy of two AGN sightlines passing through the Sextans B CGM at small impact parameters of 4 kpc and 8 kpc (0.04 and 0.08 r_vir), we detect the CGM in Si II, Si III, Si IV, and C II absorption. All four ions show a column-density profile that declines with radius. The profiles fall below the average CGM profiles of other nearby dwarfs (by 0.3-0.6 dex, depending on ion), likely due to the low halo mass and low metallicity of Sextans B. Using Cloudy photoionization models and interferometric measurements of the H I column density, we find low gas-phase silicon and carbon abundances in the Sextans B CGM, [Si/H]=-1.7+/-0.2 and [C/H]=-2.1+/-0.2, among the lowest gas-phase abundances anywhere in the Local Group. We calculate a cool CGM gas mass within 8 kpc of $\sim8\times10^8 M_\odot$, making the CGM the dominant baryon reservoir of the galaxy, ~20 times larger than both the H I mass and the stellar mass.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00436v1" target="_blank"><h2>Anatomy of RHN DM relic in the vanilla scotogenic neutrino mass model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sujit Kumar Sahoo, Narendra Sahu, Vicky Singh Thounaojam<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, hep-ex<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 35 pages, 25 captioned figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The scotogeneic neutrino mass models are very popular choices to generate light neutrino masses via radiative mechanism. In these models, the particles running in the loop are distinguished from the standard model due to an imposed $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the loop particles are odd. Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim2000 {\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim 1000 {\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass. We also find the displaced vertex signatures of long lived particles which can be probed at future colliders.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00413v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining Primordial Black Holes via p-wave annihilation in light of CMB Spectral Distortion and 21-cm global signal</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shibsankar Si, Pravin Kumar Natwariya, Alekha C.

In these halos, the enhanced density significantly boosts the annihilation rate of WIMPs. For Majorana dark matter annihilation into light fermions, the s-wave part of the annihilation cross section is helicity-suppressed, making the p-wave contribution dominant. We study the velocity-dependent p-wave annihilation case, whose resulting energy injection can modify the thermal and ionization history of the Universe, leaving observable imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum and the global 21-cm signal. From the predicted energy injection into the plasma, we derive stringent upper limits on the fraction of dark matter in form of PBHs for p-wave annihilation models, based on the observational constraints of the CMB spectral distortions ($y$-type), and from the measurement of the 21-cm absorption signal at cosmic dawn. Our results highlight that accounting for the p-wave nature of annihilation is crucial for deriving robust constraints on the PBH abundance.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00394v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ring Asymmetry and Spin in M87*</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vadim Bernshteyn, Nicholas S.

General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00358v1" target="_blank"><h2>Asymmetric torus variability in active galactic nuclei driven by global brightening and dimming</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Suyeon Son, Minjin Kim, Luis C.

In this study, we investigated the variability of the torus by analyzing temporal asymmetry in the mid-infrared (MIR) continuum. We compared ensemble structure functions between the brightening and dimming phases for AGNs at $0.15<z<0.4$, using monitoring data in the optical from the Zwicky Transient Facility and in the MIR from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We found that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors exhibit positive temporal asymmetry in the MIR, indicating that their variability amplitude is larger when brightening. Conversely, those with redder colors show negative asymmetry, exhibiting larger variability amplitude when decaying. However, there is no significant temporal asymmetry in the $g$-band variability driven by the accretion disk, suggesting that the temporal asymmetry in the MIR continuum primarily originates from intrinsic processes in the torus instead of the reflection of the ultraviolet-optical variability from the accretion disk. Analysis of the composite light curves revealed that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors tend to brighten gradually in the MIR, leading to the observed temporal asymmetry. This finding suggests that hot-dust-rich AGNs evolve with a gradual decline in hot dust emission, while hot-dust-poor AGNs are associated with a steady increase.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00169v1" target="_blank"><h2>Isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background reconstruction for Taiji constellation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yang Jiang, Qing-Guo Huang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 10 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The stochastic gravitational wave background is a broadband target from diverse astrophysical and cosmological sources.

JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \& optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00079v1" target="_blank"><h2>The propagation of long GRB jets through and beyond its progenitor star</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gerardo Urrutia, Agnieszka Janiuk<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 2 figures, conference proceeding<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Long gamma-ray bursts (lGRB) are produced by relativistic jets arising from the collapse of massive stars.

The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor.

Extragalactic surveys of RSGs have a long history in the Local Group, but few studies exist beyond that due to the limited resolution and sensitivity of ground-based and previous space-based infrared observatories. Here we demonstrate the combined power of HST and JWST to push systematic searches of RSGs out to $\sim$20 Mpc. We introduce a catalog of 97057 RSGs -- the largest single-survey release of RSGs -- with masses $\gtrsim$10 M$_{\odot}$ in 19 galaxies from the PHANGS HST+JWST Treasury program. We use HST F814W and JWST F200W photometry to select stars as RSGs based on predicted colors and magnitudes from PARSEC isochrones. The spatial distribution of our recovered RSGs follow the familiar pattern of mostly being concentrated in active star-forming regions such as spiral arms and central starburst rings. The RSG number density on kpc-scales is strongly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.82) with local star-formation rate density ($Σ_{SFR}$) traced by extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet (FUV) from GALEX+WISE, and weakly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.57) with the total stellar mass density ($Σ_*$), traced by near-infrared emission from WISE+Spitzer. The number of RSGs per mass of stellar populations with ages 6-30 Myr (the likely age range of RSGs $>$10 M$_{\odot}$) is $\sim$1 per 10$^{3.77\pm0.27}$ M$_{\odot}$, assuming constant star-formation rates from FUV+W4. Our sample will be a useful resource for tracking progenitors and feedback sites of future supernovae in PHANGS, age-dating stellar populations, and more.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25044v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black hole dark matter from ultra-slow-roll inflation in Horndeski gravity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Despina Totolou, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Emmanuel N. Saridakis<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25040v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards precision cosmology with Voids x CMB correlations (I): Roman-Agora mock catalogs and pipeline validation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mar Pérez Sar, Carlos Hernández Monteagudo, András Kovács, Alice Pisani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We construct and validate a set of multi-purpose mock galaxy catalogs designed to capture, to different degrees of accuracy, the main characteristics of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey. These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24966v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic Himalayas in CROCODILE : Probing the Extreme Quasar Overdensities by Count-in-Cells analysis and Nearest Neighbor Distribution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuto Kuwayama, Yongming Liang, Kentaro Nagamine, Yuri Oku, Daisuke Nishihama, Daisuke Toyouchi, Keita Fukushima, Hidenobu Yajima, Hyunbae Park, Masami Ouchi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), quasar (title, abstract), IGM (abstract), LLS (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) -- an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 -- poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24936v1" target="_blank"><h2>Searching for Periodicity in FRB 20240114A</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

Recently, FAST J0139+4328 was reported as the first isolated dark galaxy in the nearby universe, based on a neutral hydrogen (HI) detection and a non-detection in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. To verify the nature of this candidate, we obtained deep optical imaging, using the $1.4\,\mathrm{m}$ \textit{Milanković} and $0.6\,\mathrm{m}$ \textit{Nedeljković} telescopes, and spectroscopic follow-up of the field. We report the unambiguous discovery of a low-surface-brightness (LSB) optical counterpart at the location of the HI cloud. Furthermore, the detection of H$α$ emission via the $6\,\mathrm{m}$ Big Telescope Alt-Azimuthal (BTA) confirms that the stellar system lies at a redshift consistent with the HI source, establishing their physical association. Through detailed photometry and employing color-dependent mass-to-light scaling relations, we derive a total stellar mass of $M_\star = (7.2 \pm 3.7) \times 10^6\, M_{\odot}$, about an order of magnitude higher than the previously estimated upper limit. Using the literature HI mass, this implies a gas-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_{\mathrm{HI}} / M_{\star} = 11.5 \pm 6.4$. Our findings demonstrate that FAST J0139+4328 is not a dark galaxy but an extremely gas-rich LSB dwarf galaxy, whose stellar component was simply below the detection limit of the Pan-STARRS1 survey. This reclassification resolves the status of this prominent dark galaxy candidate and underscores the necessity of deep optical follow-up to classify faint HI-selected systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24918v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological dynamics and observational constraints of an interacting early scalar field coupled to radiation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dorian Araya, Felipe Herrera, Nelson Videla<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 35 pages, 8 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), cosmic evolution (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the cosmic evolution of an interacting scalar field radiation model, in which a minimally coupled scalar field exchanges energy with the radiation sector through an exponential coupling. Extending previous formulations, a non-relativistic matter component is included explicitly, which allows a self consistent description of cosmological dynamics from the radiation-dominated era to late-time acceleration. Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times. Model comparison suggest that the interacting scenario is statistically competitive but not decisively preferred by current background data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24895v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving the Origins and Pathways of Ionizing Radiation Escape with UV Integral Field Spectroscopy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Cody Carr, Renyue Cen, Brian Fleming, Sophia Flury, Stephan McCandliss, Sally Oey, Allison Strom<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 2 figures, comments welcome. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:2506.23105<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract), feedback (abstract), stellar feedback (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24840v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scalable Stellar Parameter Inference Using Python-based LASP: From CPU Optimization to GPU Acceleration</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jun-Chao Liang, Yin-Bi Li, A-Li Luo, Fang Zuo, Bing Du, Shuo Li, Xiao-Xiao Ma, Shu-Guo Ma, Hai-Ling Lu, Ke-Fei Wu, Zhi-Hua Zhong, Wen Hou, Xiao Kong, Shuo Ye, Li-Li Wang, Hugh R.

Rather than a direct code translation, this framework refactors LASP with two complementary modules: LASP-CurveFit, a new implementation of the LASP fitting procedure that runs on a CPU, preserving legacy logic while improving data I/O and multithreaded execution efficiency; and LASP-Adam-GPU, a GPU-accelerated method that introduces grouped optimization by constructing a joint residual function over multiple observed and model spectra, enabling high-throughput parameter inference across tens of millions of spectra. Applied to 10 million LAMOST spectra, the framework reduces runtime from 84 to 48 hr on the same CPU platform and to 7 hr on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, while producing results consistent with those from the original pipeline. The inferred errors agree well with the parameter variations from repeat observations of the same target (excluding radial velocities), while the official empirical errors used in LASP are more conservative. When applied to DESI DR1, our effective temperatures and surface gravities agree better with APOGEE than those from the DESI pipeline, particularly for cool giants, while the latter performs slightly better in radial velocity and metallicity. These results suggest that the framework delivers reliable accuracy, efficiency, and transferability, offering a practical approach to parameter inference in large spectroscopic surveys.

It aims to minimize the reliance on external catalogs and find TDE candidates from pure light curves, which is more suitable for finding TDEs in faint and distant galaxies. \texttt{TTC} consists of two key modules that can work independently: (1) A light curve parametric fitting module and (2) a Transformer (\texttt{Mgformer})-based classification network. The training of the latter module and evaluation for each module utilize a light curve dataset of 7413 spectroscopically classified transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The \texttt{Mgformer}-based module is superior in performance and flexibility. Its representative recall and precision values are 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, and can be modified by adjusting the threshold. It can also efficiently find TDE candidates within 30 days from the first detection. For comparison, the parametric fitting module yields values of 0.72 and 0.40, respectively, while it is $>$10 times faster in average speed. Hence, the setup of modules allows a trade-off between performance and time, as well as precision and recall. \texttt{TTC} has successfully picked out all spectroscopically identified TDEs among ZTF transients in a real-time classification test, and selected $\sim$20 TDE candidates in the deep field survey data of WFST. The discovery rate will greatly increase once the differential database for the wide field survey is ready.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24764v1" target="_blank"><h2>LUNCH: A Lightweight Unified Deep-Learning Framework for General Transients Classification in High-Energy Time-Domain Astronomy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Peng Zhang, Chen-Wei Wang, Zheng-Hang Yu, Ren-Zhou Gui, Shao-Lin Xiong, Xiao-Bo Li, Li-Ming Song, Shi-Jie Zheng, Xiao-Yun Zhao, Yue Huang, Wang-Chen Xue, Ya-Qi Wang, Long-Bo Han, Jia-Cong Liu, Chao Zheng, Wen-Jun Tan, Sheng-Lun Xie, Ce Cai, Yan-Qiu Zhang, Hao-Xuan Guo, Yue Wang, Yang-Zhao Ren<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), time-domain (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The increasing data volume of high-energy space monitors necessitates real-time, automated transient classification for multi-messenger follow-up. Conventional methods rely on empirical features like hardness ratios and reliable localization, which are not always precisely available during early detection. We developed the Lightweight Unified Neural Classifier for High-energy Transients (LUNCH) - an end-to-end deep-learning framework that performs general transient classification directly from raw multi-band light curves, eliminating the need for background subtraction or source localization. Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data. Feature visualization reveals well-separated class clusters, confirming physical interpretability. LUNCH combines high accuracy, low computational cost, and instrument-agnostic inputs, offering a practical solution for real-time in-flight processing that enables timely triggers for immediate multi-wavelength and multi-messenger follow-up observations in future time-domain missions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00044v1" target="_blank"><h2>Born in the Dark: The Catastrophic Collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons as the Origin of Little Red Dots</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tak-Pong Woo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> JWST surveys have uncovered a population of compact, red sources ("Little Red Dots," LRDs) at $z \ge 5$ that exhibit broad Balmer emission yet remain X-ray faint, implying heavy obscuration with $N_H \ge 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii ($r_e \sim 30-100$ pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses $m$ few $\times 10^{-22}$ eV are plausible for soliton masses $M_s \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\odot$; we adopt $m_{22}=2$ as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching $N_H \ge 10^{24} - 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an "Opacity Crisis") and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using $512^3$ pseudo-spectral Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high-density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings. We discuss observational implications and tests, and outline the need for future radiation-hydrodynamic modeling to predict demographics and detailed spectra.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24729v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of PSR J0614-3329 in defining the high-density matter at Neutron star cores</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Asim Kumar Saha, Tuhin Malik, Ritam Mallick<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 Figures and 3 Tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we investigate how astrophysical observations from NICER and GW data constrain the matter properties at high densities, with a primary focus on the recent PSR J0614-3329 data. We have constructed three distinct classes of an ensemble of agnostic equation of state by speed of sound parametrisation. Bayesian inference is then employed to constrain the EoS construction parameters-namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential at each interpolation segment-using the observational data. Both the NICER and GW constraints hint towards a smoother EoS where PT occurs late, significantly reducing the maximum mass of NS. Also, the maximum-mass and maximum-compact sequences are distinctly different, as the former allows for the maximally stiff EoS to maximise the star mass. In contrast, the latter prefers a softer low-density and stiffer high-density EoS to maximise the compactness. The Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the observational bounds are effective in significantly constraining the low-density region of the equation of state. It is also seen that the astrophysical bound prefers the phase transition in the intermediate-density range and also prefers a small density jump for a discontinuous equation of state.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24677v1" target="_blank"><h2>Destruction of the interstellar dust by a supernova</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Evgenii O.

The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\rm log}~M_d \sim {\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \sim ζ_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24670v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust destruction in bubbles driven by multiple supernovae explosions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Evgenii O.

We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\ast > 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ it is less $0.4$\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\ast < 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\ast \sim 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\ast \sim 8\times 10^5 M_\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters.

By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($Γ_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($σ_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($η$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $Γ_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+σ_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($η\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($σ_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $ν\barν$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24537v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Redshifts from 122 Bands: Comparative Redshift Forecast for Low-Resolution Spectra from SPHEREx and 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS)</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jangho Bae, Bomee Lee, Myungshin Im, Hyeonguk Bahk, Kim Dachan, Ho Seong Hwang, Sungryong Hong, Suk Kim, Minjin Kim, Taewan Kim, Jeyeon Lee, Jubee Sohn, Hyunmi Song, Seo-Won Chang, Yun-Ting Cheng, Andreas L.

These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 < i < 18) galaxies, with $σ_{NMAD}\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24502v1" target="_blank"><h2>Higgs-like inflation in scalar-torsion $f(T,φ)$ gravity in light of ACT-SPT-DESI constraints</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nitesh Kumar, Giovanni Otalora, Rodrigo Reyes, Bastian Espinoza, Manuel Gonzalez-Espinoza, Emmanuel N.

Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24433v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Convolutional Neural Network for the Recovery of Transfer Functions From Velocity-Resolved Reverberation Mapping Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kirk Long, Keith Horne, Jason Dexter, Benoit Tremblay<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ, comments/suggestions welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> One of the hallmarks of active galactic nuclei are that they are highly variable with time. In watching the spectra vary it has been observed that the emission-lines often appear to "reverberate" -- that is they vary in response to continuum variations assumed to originate close to the black hole. This critical observation underlies the reverberation mapping technique, an elegant physics experiment that has allowed us to characterize the environment around many supermassive black holes in nearby active galactic nuclei. Recent observations are of such quality that the response can be measured as a function of velocity across the emission-line, and in doing so we can construct velocity-delay maps that show the structure and physics of the gas in the broad-line region better than any other measurement to date. Unfortunately constructing such maps requires a deconvolution, and given that the data are often noisy and with gaps such deconvolutions are non-trivial. Here we present a novel deconvolution method for the recovery of velocity-delay maps using a custom convolutional neural network architecture, showcasing that such methods have great promise for the deconvolution of reverberation mapping data products. While we have designed this new method with the BLR in mind, in principle this technique could be applied to any reverberation deconvolution problem, including in the accretion disk and torus.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24422v1" target="_blank"><h2>OmniCosmos: Transferring Particle Physics Knowledge Across the Cosmos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vinicius Mikuni, Ibrahim Elsharkawy, Benjamin Nachman<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Foundation models build an effective representations of data that can be deployed on diverse downstream tasks.

The sun's time variable magnetic flux linkage makes the sun (as well, perhaps, as Jupiter) a natural, all-purpose, betatron storage ring, with semi-infinite acceptance aperture, capable of storing and accelerating counter-circulating, opposite-sign, colliding beams.
  The puzzle of how positrons and anti-protons can be well represented at all energies, is explained, initially, by the low energy capture of particles of either sign by the sun's magnetic dipole field. Later, as the magnetic field bending has become negligible compared to the gravitational bending, both positive and negative beams will have survived the gradual transition from predominantly magnetic to predominantly gravitational bending. Later, anti-particles produced in QED beam-beam collisions of sufficiently high energy, are also accelerated.
  The high quality of cosmic ray data collected over recent decades, at steadily increasing energies, especially by the International Space Station (ISS), make the study of cosmic ray production mechanisms both timely and essential.
  The paper describes how longitudinal electric fields, explained by the Parker solar wind theory can enable the sun to serve as a ``booster'' accelerator of cosmic rays, increasing the maximum cosmic ray energies enough to produce the observed 13 orders of magnitude maximum particle energy and the energy flux needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray atmosphere equilibrium within the solar system.
  A steady state mechanism is described, based on semi-quantitative discussion of a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, according to which the highest energy cosmic rays observed can have been produced by the Parker longitudinal electric field component, during fractionally brief, but periodic, circular or semi-circular turns centered on the sun.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24350v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-Gravitating Scalar Field Configurations, Ultra Light Dark Matter and Galactic Scale Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bihag Dave<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Thesis accepted for the award of PhD degree from Ahmedabad University, September 2025.

We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $λ$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $λ$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $λ\sim \pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$ and $λ\gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24309v1" target="_blank"><h2>$S_8-H_0$ tension in a SI-ULDM scenario</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jessica N.

In the presence of a quartic self-interaction, the scalar field undergoes a short-lived radiation-like phase before evolving into matter-like behaviour, inducing a localized modification of the expansion history at early times. We develop a perturbative and model-independent framework in which the self-interaction energy density is parametrized as a localized contribution to the total energy budget. Within this approach, the responses of the sound horizon and the linear growth factor can be expressed as weighted integrals over cosmic time, with distinct kernels encoding the temporal sensitivity of each observable. This structure leads to a simple analytic relation linking the corresponding early- and late-time responses, and naturally predicts correlated shifts in $H_0$ and $S_8$ whose sign and magnitude depend on the timing of the self-interaction episode. Our results show that a single transient modification of the expansion history can interpolate between early-time effects on the sound horizon and late-time suppression of structure growth within a unified physical framework, providing an analytical understanding of their joint response.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24299v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Nbody1 to Nbody7: the Growth of Sverres Industry</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rainer Spurzem<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 3 figures; talk presented at IAU symposium No.398, Compact Objects and Binaries in Dense Star Clusters, in Seoul, Korea (Rep.), June 16-20, 2025, in special session about the work and life of Sverre Aarseth; accepted for publication in Proceedings of IAU Symposium No. 398, H.M.

My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24194v2" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of Anisotropy on Neutron Star Structure and Curvature</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\;M_\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.
  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\mathcal{C}_{\max}\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $λ_{\rm BL}\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24187v1" target="_blank"><h2>Connecting disc-corona physics and ionised outflows in AGN in the 2040s</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Susanna Bisogni, Giustina Vietri, Andrea Travascio, Adriana Gargiulo, Chiara Mancini, Swayamtrupta Panda<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Cover page plus 3 pages according to the guidelines issued by the ESO Expanding Horizons initiative 2025 (call for White Papers)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title), outflow (title), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), time-domain (abstract), CGM (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We outline a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys aimed at connecting the physics of the accretion disc and X-ray corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the properties of their nebular regions and circumgalactic medium (CGM).

Previous studies have hinted at a possible linear correlation between the hard X-ray and high-energy neutrino emission in active galactic nuclei. New \textit{NuSTAR} observations, first presented here, reveal that blazar PKS 1424+240, located within a prominent IceCube neutrino hotspot, is far fainter in hard X-rays than expected from this trend. Motivated by this apparent ambiguity, we identify the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 5610, also coincident with the hotspot, whose unabsorbed hard X-ray flux exceeds that of PKS 1424+240 by about an order of magnitude. When the local IceCube neutrino flux is apportioned between the two AGN in proportion to their hard X-ray emission, both align with the previously suggested X-ray-neutrino correlation. This suggests that certain IceCube hotspots may be unresolved blends of multiple AGN, and supports a multimessenger scenario in which high-energy neutrinos and hard X-rays originate from the same hadronic interactions, with the X-ray emission produced through cascade reprocessing.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24141v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of Accretion Properties in Mrk 1040 using long-term X-ray Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Prantik Nandi, Narendranath Layek, Sandip K Chakrabarti, Sachindra Naik, Priyadarshee P.

The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\rm e,warm} \sim 0.26$~keV and a radial extent of $R_{\rm warm} \sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe~K$α$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk~1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\rm BH} = (4.50 \pm 1.62) \times 10^7~M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24085v1" target="_blank"><h2>SSC Radiation in the ICMART Model: Spectral Simulations and Application to the Record-Breaking GRB 221009A</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xueying Shao, He Gao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations.

Our simulations demonstrate that particle feedback to the fluid amplifies shear flows within magnetic islands, which strengthens the convective electric field and thereby boosts particle acceleration.

Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range.

We derive solutions for three types of boundary conditions applied at the inner radius $r_{\rm in}$: (i) zero torque, (ii) zero mass accretion rate, and (iii) finite torque and finite accretion rate, and investigate the time evolution of a disk with an initial surface density represented by a Dirac-delta function. The mass accretion rate at the inner radius decays with time as $t^{-3/2}$ for $n = 1$ at late times in the absence of winds under the zero-torque condition, consistent with Lynden-Bell \& Pringle (1974), while the presence of winds leads to a steeper decay. All boundary conditions yield identical asymptotic time evolution for the accretion and wind mass-loss rates, though their radial profiles differ near $r_{\rm in}$. Applying our solutions to protoplanetary disks, we find that the disk follows distinct evolutionary tracks in the accretion rate-disk mass plane depending on $ψ$, a dimensionless parameter that regulates the strength of the vertical stress driving the wind, with the disk lifetime decreasing as $ψ$ increases due to enhanced wind-driven mass loss. The inner boundary condition influences the evolution for $ψ< 1$ but becomes negligible at higher $ψ$, indicating that strong magnetically driven winds dominate and limit mass inflow near the boundary. Our Green's function solutions offer a general framework to study the long-term evolution of accretion disks with magnetically driven winds.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23958v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variation of the 2175 Å extinction feature in Andromeda galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bing Yan, Shu Wang, Jian Gao, Yuxi Wang, Bingqiu Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in RAA<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), interstellar dust (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extinction curves contain key information on interstellar dust composition and size distribution, with the 2175 Å bump being the most prominent feature. We analyze 20 sightlines toward M31 using HST/STIS UV spectroscopy combined with multi-band photometry to characterize this feature. The extinction curves show substantial diversity, from MW-like shapes to flatter profiles with $R_V$ reaching up to $\sim5.8$. The strength of the 2175 Å feature varies widely, including two sightlines where the bump is essentially absent. The bump central wavelength spans a broader range than previously reported, while its width remains consistent with earlier studies. A moderate positive correlation is found between bump strength ($c_3$) and width ($γ$). We derive an average UV extinction curve toward M31 with $R_V \approx 3.53$.

However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU/VLT data, we explored its gaseous structure through optical emission lines to gain insights into the present-day drivers of gas physics in this dIrr, and we place constraints on the chemical evolution scenario responsible for this low chemical enrichment. The emission line maps reveal that the strongest emission comes from the south-west region. A stratified distribution of ionic species was detected, likely powered by the young star cluster at the nebular centre. HST/ACS data show that the brightest star is in the centre of both the HII region and the star cluster. Photoionization production rates derived indicate that this star can sustain the ionization budget to power the HII region, although subject to the assumed electron density. Using the direct method, we derived a metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.29\pm0.06$ dex, increasing to $7.46\pm0.09$ dex after correcting for temperature fluctuations, placing Leo A in the low-mass end of the MZR. Chemical evolution models suggest that, under constant accretion, the stellar mass growth and metal enrichment over the last 10 Gyr are successfully reproduced by both leaky-box and gas-regulator models. Those results are similar to those found in SagDIG, supporting a picture in which the present-day evolution of Leo A is dominated by stellar feedback processes. The combination of mass loss mechanisms and accretion events reproduces its chemical evolution, suggesting that Leo A has evolved under a gas equilibrium regime across its lifetime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23815v1" target="_blank"><h2>COBIPLANE: A Systematic Search for Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars at Low Galactic Latitudes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marco Turchetta, Manuel Linares, Karri Koljonen, Paulo A.

We conducted observations targeting 30 unidentified sources from the 4FGL-DR3 Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) catalog, selected for their pulsar-like $γ$-ray properties. Extending to Galactic latitudes as low as $\pm3^{\circ}$, this survey reaches closer to the Galactic plane than its predecessor survey, the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch (COBIPULSE).

Analytical studies have reached different conclusions regarding loop capture in galaxies: early treatments argued for efficient capture, while later analyses incorporating the loop rocket force throughout halo formation found that capture efficiency is reduced and strongly dependent on loop size. In this work, we employ the N-body simulation code GADGET-4, introducing non-backreacting tracer particles subject to a constant recoil force to model cosmic string loops with the rocket effect. We simulate the formation of a Milky-Way-like halo from redshift $z=127$ to $z=0$, considering loop populations characterized by a range of length parameters $ξ$, inversely proportional to the rocket acceleration. We find that the number of captured loops exhibits a pronounced peak at $ξ_{\textrm{peak}}\simeq 12.5$, arising from the competition between rocket-driven ejection at small $ξ$ and the declining intrinsic loop abundance at large $ξ$. For fiducial string tensions, this corresponds to $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ loops within the halo. We further find that loops with weak rocket forces closely trace the dark-matter distribution, while those subject to stronger recoil but still captured -- particularly the most abundant loops near $ξ_{\textrm{peak}}$ -- are preferentially concentrated toward the central regions of the halo.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23796v1" target="_blank"><h2>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapped Theories of Unparticles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yikun Jiang, Guilherme L.

More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars. If we assume the interactions are localized on a brane, gapped unparticles with different effective masses will share a universal coupling, and their exchanges produce an interesting interference pattern.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23789v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Recipe for the First Giants: From Population III Stars to Early Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Matter Capture</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sulagna Bhattacharya, Debajit Bose, Basudeb Dasgupta, Jaya Doliya, Ranjan Laha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> v1: 17 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

We propose a mechanism in which non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model (SM) particles accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, inducing their premature collapse into BH seeds having the same mass as the parent star. Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23691v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Zoo Evo: 1 million human-annotated images of galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mike Walmsley, Steven Bamford, Hugh Dickinson, Tobias Géron, Alexander J.

These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($τ_{\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23477v1" target="_blank"><h2>Compact star and compact star matter properties from a baryonic extended linear sigma model with explicit chiral symmetry breaking</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yao Ma, Yong-Liang Ma, Lu-Qi Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> nucl-th, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Based on a baryonic extended linear sigma model including explicit chiral symmetry breaking effect, the structure of neutron star with the emergence of hyperons is investigated using the relativistic mean field approximation. It's found that, except the lightest scalar meson $σ$ whose structure is not well understood so far, the vacuum mass spectra of relevant hadrons and NM properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Nevertheless, we found that, to have a realistic mass-radius relation of neutron stars, the $πN$ sigma term $σ_{πN}$, which denotes the contribution of explicit symmetry breaking, should deviate from its empirical values at vacuum. Specifically, $σ_{πN}\sim -600$ MeV, rather than $(32-89) \rm \ MeV$ at vacuum. With an appropriate choice of $σ_{πN}$ and $K(n_0)$, our framework can give a more data favored mass-radius relation of neutron stars with the emergence of hyperons. The effect of explicit symmetry breaking at densities is hoped to provide a new insight to the relation between microscopic symmetries in medium and macroscopic phenomena.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23452v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detections of Compact Radio Continuum toward Methanol Maser Rings Using the VLA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anna Bartkiewicz, Olga Bayandina, Alberto Sanna, Marian Szymczak, Luca Moscadelli, Agnieszka Kobak, Huib Jan van Langevelde, Ashwin Varma<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), kinematics (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-mass protostars are deeply embedded in dust inside their natal cores and are not easily detectable.

SN 2022eyw reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g = -17.80\pm0.15$ mag and exhibited a rise time of $\sim$15 days, placing it among the brighter Iax events. The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\pm0.003~\text{M}_{\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\pm0.09~\text{M}_{\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\times10^{51}$ erg. The spectral evolution from -8 to +110 days past maximum reveals features characteristic of bright Type Iax Supernovae, including a transition from Fe III to Fe II dominance, moderate expansion velocities, and a lack of strong C III absorption. TARDIS spectral modelling of the early-phase spectra indicates a well-mixed ejecta dominated by Fe-group elements. In addition, traces of unburnt carbon are detected, pointing to incomplete burning as expected in pure deflagration models. Late-time spectral evolution shows a blend of permitted and forbidden lines. Comparison with deflagration models suggests that SN 2022eyw originated from a partial deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, with explosion properties intermediate between the N3-def and N5-def models.

We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\arcsec\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23354v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kilonova and progenitor properties of merger-driven gamma-ray bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> P.

We aim to infer the KN ejecta parameters and the progenitor properties by modeling merger-driven GRBs with a claim of KN, good data and robust redshift measurement. We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library. In contrast to previous approaches, our methodology simultaneously models both afterglow and KN. We find that all GRBs in our sample have a KN, but we were unable to confirm or exclude its presence in GRB 150101B. A BNS progenitor is favored for GRB 160821B, GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, GRB 211211A, and GRB 230307A. For GRB 150101B and GRB 191019A, we obtain a slight preference for NSBH scenario, while a BNS is also viable. For KN emission, we find that the median wind mass $\langle M_{\rm wind}\rangle=0.027^{+0.046}_{-0.019}$ $M_{\odot}$ is larger than the dynamical $\langle M_{\rm dyn}\rangle = 0.012^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ $M_{\odot}$. We find that $M_{\rm wind}$ and the beaming corrected kinetic energy of the jet can be attributed as $log(M_{\rm wind})=-20.23+0.38\,log(E_{0,J})$.

By analyzing four models of DM-nucleon interactions -- namely scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector mediators -- we derive constraints on the coupling parameters using data from the LZ, XENON, and Borexino experiments, covering mediator mass from $10^{-6}$ to $1$ GeV. As the mediator mass varies, the shift in dominance between momentum transfer and mediator mass leads to a turnover in the constraints around $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Our results extend the reach of direct detection into the sub-GeV window and clarify the critical role of momentum dependence in light-mediator scenarios.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23267v1" target="_blank"><h2>SN 2022acko: a low-luminosity SNe IIP with signs of early circumstellar interaction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lin Han, Zhang Jujia, Wang Xiaofeng, Hu Maokai, Zha Shuai, Xiang Danfeng, Li Liping, Reguitti Andrea, Zhang Xinghan, Cai Yongzhi, Wang Zhenyu, Zhao Zeyi, Zhai Qian, Huang Fang, Lin Weili, Bai Jinming<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> published in MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present optical-ultraviolet photometry and optical spectra for the type II supernova (SN) 2022acko. The spectroscopic observations span phases from $\sim$ 1.5 to $\sim$ 60 days after the explosion, while the light curve was observed up to $\sim$ 300 days. The V-band peak is $-15.5 \pm 0.3$ mag, suggesting that SN 2022acko is a low-luminosity SN II (LLSN). The overall observed properties of SN 2022acko are consistent with those produced by a lower mass progenitor ($\rm M_{ZAMS} \sim $9-10M$_{\odot}$). The spectra at $t=1.5$d and $t=2.5$d exhibit a broad emission feature peaking near 4600 Å(the ``ledge'' feature), which we interpret as blueshifted He II 4686 Ålines arising from the ionized ejecta. Moreover, a possible flash-ionized (FI) emission line of H$α$ (FWHM $\sim 1100\ \rm km \ s^{-1}$) was superposed on the broad emission component of H$α$ P-Cgyni profile in the $t=1.5$d spectrum. Assuming an ejecta velocity of $\rm 12000\ km\ s^{-1}$, the rapid disappearance of this narrow H$α$ emission line within two days suggests highly confined CSM within $\sim \rm 2\times10^{14}\, cm$. Assuming a spherically symmetric CSM, the mass loss rate within this radius is estimated to be $\rm \sim 5 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \ year^{-1}$ based on our hybrid light curve model. The early ``ledge'' feature observed in SN 2022acko have also been observed in other SNe II, suggesting that early-phase circumstellar interaction (CSI) is more common than previously thought.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23252v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interpreting the diversity of afterglow emission from radio-detected tidal disruption events with instantaneous and delayed outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuri Sato, Mukul Bhattacharya, Jose Carpio, Jewel Capili, Kohta Murase<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title, abstract), outflow (title, abstract), ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is gravitationally disrupted by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole during a close encounter. Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23231v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling Multimessenger Emission from Hidden Cores of Microquasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yu-Jia Wei, Kohta Murase, B.

They are established sources of 100~TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $>$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $pγ$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $γγ$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23157v1" target="_blank"><h2>The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program.

Based on emission lines spectroscopically identified in the F115W, F150W and F200W filters, we select 99 H$α$ emitters. Through detailed effective volume and completeness analysis for each source, we construct the H$α$ LF in two redshift bins. Thanks to the sensitivity of NIRISS WFSS and gravitational lensing magnification, our sample reaches intrinsic H$α$ luminosities $\sim$10 times deeper than previous grism surveys, down to $L_{\rm Hα}\sim10^{40.5}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $L_{\rm Hα}\sim10^{40.9}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\sim2.0$ with completeness larger than 0.8, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, respectively. We robustly constrain the faint-end slope of the H$α$ luminosity function to be $-1.50^{+0.14}_{-0.08}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $-1.60^{+0.17}_{-0.09}$ at $z\sim2.0$ after considering the cosmic variance of $\sim 20\%$, consistent with previous estimations. The emission-line samples presented here will enable further detailed studies of galaxy properties including metallicities. We find a negligible contribution from bright active galactic nuclei in our sample. We estimate integrated cosmic star formation rate densities of $0.097^{+0.015}_{-0.016}~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $0.129^{+0.025}_{-0.030}~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}$ at $z\sim2.0$.

We conduct a systematic search for quasars behind the Galactic plane using X-ray sources from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC 2.1), combined with optical data from Gaia DR3 and mid-infrared data from CatWISE2020. Using spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars from data sets including DESI, SDSS, and LAMOST, we apply a Random Forest classifier to identify quasar candidates, with stellar contaminants suppressed using Gaia proper-motion constraints. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the candidates using a Random Forest regression model. Applying this framework to previously unclassified CSC sources, we identify 6286 quasar candidates, including 863 Galactic Plane Quasar (GPQ) candidates at |b|<20°, of which 514 are high-confidence candidates. Relative to the previously known GPQ sample, our selected GPQs reach fainter optical and X-ray fluxes, improving sensitivity to low-flux GPQs. In addition, both the GPQ candidates and known GPQs display harder X-ray spectra than the all-sky quasar sample, consistent with increased absorption through the Galactic plane. Pilot spectroscopy confirms two high-confidence GPQ candidates as quasars at spectroscopic redshifts of z=1.2582 and z=1.1313, and further spectroscopic follow-up of the GPQ sample is underway. This work substantially improves the census of GPQs and provides a valuable target sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, enabling the use of GPQs to refine the reference frames for astrometry and probe the Milky Way interstellar and circumgalactic media with the absorption features of GPQs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23057v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstructing Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Corwin Cheung, Marcos Johnson-Noya, Michael Xiang, Dominic Chang, Alfredo Guevara<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> physics.comp-ph, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages with figures.

By tracking the complex electric field vector for each photon during its atmospheric transport and propagation in general relativistic and birefringent magnetospheres, our Monte Carlo simulation, named MAGTHOMSCATT, allows for capturing the complete polarization properties, including the intricate interplay between linearity and circularity. The new inclusion in MAGTHOMSCATT of quantum electrodynamical influences on polarization in the magnetosphere is presented. We simulate the pulsed and polarized X-ray emission from the outer layers of optically thick, fully ionized atmospheres of neutron stars, with a focus on the radiation emitted from extended polar caps of magnetars, which are the most highly magnetized neutron stars. Using the recent intensity pulse profile data for the magnetar 1RXS J11708-4009, we constrain the geometric parameters, namely the angles between the magnetic axis and the observer's viewing direction relative to the spin axis, as well as the sizes of emission regions. The distributions of these parameters and the best-fit configuration are provided. In addition, we discuss the important impacts of vacuum birefringence in the magnetosphere on increasing the linear polarization degree. A comparison with the case of a weakly magnetized neutron star, RX J0822.0-4300, is also discussed. Our simulation still needs further development, particularly to incorporate the vacuum resonance effect. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here can be employed to constrain geometric parameters for various types of neutron stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22964v1" target="_blank"><h2>A new path to constrain the expansion history of the Universe in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elena Tomasetti, Michele Moresco, Nicola Borghi, Dinko Milaković, Stephanie Escoffier, Margherita Talia, Lucia Pozzetti, Andrea Cimatti, Lauro Moscardini<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> White Paper submitted to "ESO Expanding Horizons: Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s"<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The current tension between early- and late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), along with the still elusive nature of dark matter and dark energy, calls for model-independent probes of the Universe's expansion history. The cosmic chronometers (CC) method offers a unique opportunity to directly measure the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ without relying on any cosmological model assumptions or integrated distance measurements. Despite its potential, this technique remains statistics-limited: no current survey is optimized to detect large samples of CC, restricting the precision on $H(z)$ to $\sim$20% at intermediate redshifts. Here, we investigate the opportunities that a next-generation spectroscopic facility could offer to CC studies, providing an estimate of the accuracy achievable on the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter in redshift. We demonstrate that with such a facility, it will be possible to derive constraints on key cosmological parameters, assessing the impact that such improvements would have on our understanding of the expansion history of the Universe and on current cosmological tensions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22945v2" target="_blank"><h2>Colloquium: Multimessenger astronomy with continuous gravitational waves and future detectors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Benjamin J.

Although there are caveats, current theories and observations suggest that the first detections are likely within a few years, and that many are likely in the era of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter.

If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope.

Traditional constraints on the equation of state rely on Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff modelling and comparison with multimessenger observations, but machine learning provides a complementary pathway by learning composition dependent patterns directly from astrophysically accessible observables. This work presents a compact supervised learning framework for EOS family classification using stellar properties derived from TOV modelling, asteroseismology, and gravitational wave descriptors. A labelled dataset of neutron star configurations spanning four EOS families (nucleonic, strange matter, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic) is constructed using seven input features: gravitational mass, radius, fundamental f mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, and characteristic strain. A multilayer perceptron is trained to infer the underlying matter composition. On a held out test set, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent with strong class wise precision and recall. Permutation based feature importance analysis shows that oscillation related quantities, especially the f mode frequency and damping time, dominate the discriminatory power, while mass and radius provide secondary support. Residual misclassifications occur in physically intuitive regions where different EOS families produce partially overlapping macroscopic signatures. These results show that lightweight neural models can reliably identify EOS family fingerprints from a modest set of observables, providing a reproducible baseline for future extensions incorporating Bayesian uncertainty and observational posteriors from NICER and gravitational wave events.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22751v2" target="_blank"><h2>Rotation and stability of the circumnuclear gas disk in the Galactic Center potential by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yoshiaki Sofue, Steven N.

While morphological features such as tidal bridges have been visually identified in past surveys, our quantitative analysis using SDSS DR16 kinematical data reveals a significant radial velocity offset of approximately 8372 km/s. UGC 694 exhibits a heliocentric velocity of 12683 +/- 34 km/s, placing it at a distance of approximately 188 Mpc, whereas IC 412 is located in the foreground at approximately 62 Mpc with a velocity of 4311 +/- 46 km/s. This vast spatial separation of approximately 123.5 Mpc confirms that the perceived proximity is a line-of-sight projection effect rather than a physical gravitational encounter. Furthermore, we utilize differential photometry to analyze the structural asymmetry and color distribution of UGC 694. Our photometric findings suggest that the galaxy's disturbed morphology is not a result of a tidal encounter with IC 412, but likely originates from internal evolutionary processes or minor mergers with undetected companions.

The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ λ1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\b{eta}, Mgii λ 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii λ1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas.

Those quantum vortices and fluxtubes play an important role in explaining observed sudden changes of rotational frequency, known as pulsar ``glitches.'' While the most of conventional glitch models rely on pinning/unpinning dynamics of neutron $^1\text{S}_0$ superfluid vortices in the inner crust, contributions of the outer core have not been ruled out. However, the latter possibility has been less explored so far and further thorough investigations are desired. In this study, we are thus developing a microscopic model based on spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for neutron $^3$P$_2$ superfluid vortices coupled with Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for fluxtubes associated with superconducting $^1\text{S}_0$ protons.

We introduce Starkindler, a novel training objective that explicitly incorporates observational errors into the model's objective function, thereby directly accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Unlike traditional probabilistic models that focus solely on epistemic uncertainty, Starkindler provides uncertainty estimates that are regularised by aleatoric uncertainty, and is designed to be more interpretable. We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS. We show improvements in accuracy, calibration and reduction in predicted outlier rate. We also conduct an ablation study which confirms that excluding observational errors significantly degrades model performance, underscoring the importance of accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Our results suggest that Starkindler not only enhances predictive performance but also provides interpretable uncertainty estimates, making it a robust tool for astronomical data analysis.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22531v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological long-wavelength solutions in non-adiabatic multi-fluid systems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hayami Iizuka, Tomohiro Harada<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 52 pages, 5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We develop a formulation of nonlinear cosmological perturbations on superhorizon scales in multi-fluid systems.

The background spacetime is assumed to be a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. Within this framework, we explicitly construct nonlinear long-wavelength solutions for cosmological perturbations. Since multi-fluid systems are inherently non-adiabatic, these solutions admit both adiabatic and entropy modes already at leading nonlinear order.

We study the role of heavy right-handed neutrinos present in type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino masses to generate such bias term via quantum corrections. This offers interesting correlation among the seesaw scale, GW peak amplitude and peak frequency which can be probed at present and future experiments related to GW as well as precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

However, the underlying production mechanism --\textit{hadronic} versus \textit{leptonic}-- remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22103v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mass-to-Horizon Entropic Cosmology: A Unified Thermodynamic Pathway to Cosmic Acceleration</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tomasz Denkiewicz, Hussain Gohar<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 4 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the observational tests of generalized mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology by incorporating large-scale structure growth data in addition to purely geometric probes. The theoretical framework is constructed from a generalized mass-to-horizon scaling relation, $M \propto L^n$, which implies a corresponding generalized entropic functional $S_n \propto L^{n+1}$. Within this setting, cosmic acceleration arises as an emergent phenomenon driven by an entropic force acting on the cosmological horizon. While earlier studies demonstrated that these entropic cosmologies can reproduce the background expansion history of the standard $Λ$CDM model, here we present a comprehensive observational analysis that jointly employs Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova data with SH0ES calibration, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance priors, and a suite of cosmological structure growth observations. A Bayesian model comparison indicates that the entropic models are statistically preferred over the conventional $Λ$CDM scenario, thereby providing strong support for an entropic origin of the observed late-time cosmic acceleration in place of a fundamental cosmological constant.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22075v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black holes and smooth coarse-graining in excursion set theory</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daiki Saito, Koki Tokeshi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The excursion-set formalism enables us to infer the mass distribution of collapsed objects, such as primordial black holes (PBHs), by the language of stochastic processes.

We quantified intranight variability using a $χ^2$ test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability. Log-normal distributions fit the fluxes better, and all bands show a positive RMS-flux relation with red-noise PSDs.Intranight variability is detected, and used in constraining the emission region and magnetic field.The R band reaches a peak flux of 23.5 mJy, corresponding to a monochromatic luminosity of $log(νLν)= 48.48 [erg/s]$. We found a redder-when-brighter trend at low fluxes (thermal), achromatic behavior at intermediate levels (possibly due to jet orientation changes), and a bluer-when-brighter trend at high fluxes (synchrotron). Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux.

In this study, we combine data from Gaia and LAMOST to obtain a sample of young O-B2 stars with full three-dimensional velocity information. Focusing on the largest known superbubble in the Milky Way, we identify groups of O-B2 stars at its periphery, exhibiting a transverse velocity of 25.8 km/s and an expansion velocity of 6.2 km/s. Using these velocities, we calculate a crossing time t_cross ~ 20 Myr and an expansion timescale t_expansion ~ 80 Myr. We estimate a survival timescale t_survival ~ 250 Myr and a supernova interval t_SN ~ 0.1 Myr. Together with the Galactic shear timescale t_shear ~ 30 Myr, these values satisfy t_SN < t_shear < t_survival. The energy and momentum from supernovae are sufficient to sustain the bubble's growth against ambient pressure. This indicates that repeated supernovae replenish energy faster than shear and turbulent distort the cavity. Our analysis classifies the Giant Oval Cavity as a large, quasi-stationary superbubble, similar to the Phantom Bubble observed by JWST, stabilised by the interplay between stellar feedback and Galactic disk dynamics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21903v1" target="_blank"><h2>TITAN DR1: An Improved, Validated, and Systematically-Controlled Recalibration of ATLAS Photometry toward Type Ia Supernova Cosmology</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elijah G.

It has observed over 10,000 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), with thousands of cosmology-grade light curves (to be released as TITAN DR1). To prepare this massive, low-redshift dataset for cosmology, we evaluate and cross-calibrate ATLAS forced photometry using tertiary stars from the DES (Dark Energy Survey) Y6 release. The 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint overlaps regions both in and out of the PS1 (Pan-STARRS DR1) footprint, allowing tests of the primary calibrator for the ATLAS Refcat2 catalog. Initial offsets are at the $\sim$40 mmag scale. To improve this we determine $Δ$ zeropoint offsets for two cases: (1) pixel-to-pixel offsets within individual CCDs (reduced from $\sim$8 to $\sim$4 mmag RMS) and (2) chip-to-chip offsets across the 9 CCDs and filters (reduced from $\sim$17 to $\sim$3 mmag RMS). We also identify the largest systematic uncertainty as a transmission-function color dependence, requiring shifts in the assumed ATLAS filters at the $\sim$30 mmag level if uncorrected. We validate our calibration using (a) CALSPEC standards, (b) an independent tertiary catalog, and (c) distance moduli of cross-matched SNe~Ia, all showing improved consistency. Overall, we estimate combined calibration-related systematics at the $\sim$5--10 mmag level, supporting competitive cosmological constraints with the TITAN SN~Ia dataset.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21892v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Rare Millisecond Pulsar with Cross-Pole Emission: Single-Pulse Insights from PSR J1857+0943</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shi-jun Dang, Ji-guang Lu, Peng Jiang, Yu-lan Liu, Jin-tao Xie, Habtamu Menberu Tedila, Fei-fei Kou, Jian-ping Yuan, Zhi-gang Wen, Shuang-qiang Wang, Lun-hua Shang, Zu-rong Zhou, Wen-ming Yan, Qi-jun Zhi, Na Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages,8 fiugres,submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Studies of subpulse variability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) offer important constraints on their emission physics. Using the high sensitivity of FAST, we present the first identification of distinct single pulse fluctuation behaviour in PSR J1857+0943. We find that the third component(MP\_C3) of the main pulse may originate from a different region than the other two main-pulse components and may instead share a common origin with the interpulse. This conclusion is supported by four observational evidence as follows: First, the LRCCF shows a clear anticorrelation between MP\_C3 and the interpulse. Second, the single-pulse polarization at the main-pulse longitude reveals obvious component mixing. Third, the modulation period of the interpulse components is roughly twice that of MP\_C3. Fourth, the reduced modulation index in MP\_C3 suggests possible mixing of emission from different regions. The interpretation in this letter contrasts with the usual assumption that the main pulse and interpulse originate from opposite magnetic poles. Hence, PSR J1857+0943 provides a rare laboratory for probing component-dependent plasma behaviour in an MSP magnetosphere. Our results offer direct evidence that the main pulse can include emission associated with more than one magnetic pole and highlight the importance of single-pulse diagnostics for understanding the geometry and dynamics of pulsars with interpulse emission. In addition, we analyse the jitter properties of this pulsar and measure a one-hour jitter of $σ_{J,1\rm h} = 78 \pm 3~\mathrm{ns}$ at 1.25 GHz, consistent with previous studies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21889v2" target="_blank"><h2>Long-term monitoring of repeating FRB 20220912A with the uGMRT at low radio frequencies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ajay Kumar, Yogesh Maan, Banshi Lal, Yash Bhusare, Shriharsh P.

Here, we present results from a long-term monitoring campaign of FRB 20220912A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the frequency range from 300 to 750 MHz. Over the course of nearly two years, we detected a total of 643 bursts in this frequency range. The source exhibited extreme activity for a few months after its discovery and sustained its active phase for over 500 days, with unsystematic modulations in the activity during this phase. The cumulative energy distributions in both bands show a break, consistent with other active repeaters like FRB 20121102A, FRB 202011124A, etc., suggesting common underlying emission mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the energy distribution shape for FRB 20220912A remains broadly same across a large range of frequencies and over time. Overall, the extended high activity, estimated total energy output, persistent power-law tails in the energy distributions, and the lack of detectable short timescale periodicity favor progenitor models invoking young dynamic magnetars, potentially emitting pulses across large rotation phase ranges.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21888v1" target="_blank"><h2>Implications of Cosmic Birefringence for Multi-Field ALP Dark Matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jialiang Shao, Ippei Obata, Dongdong Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> cosmic evolution (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic birefringence, characterized by the observed rotation of the polarization plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, serves as a critical probe for testing theories beyond the standard cosmological scenario. As a major component of the universe, dark matter plays a pivotal role in cosmic evolution, particularly in the formation of large-scale structures. However, its fundamental nature remains elusive. Axion-like particles (ALPs), as promising dark matter candidates, possess unique advantages in naturally explaining such phenomena. Previous studies on the implications of cosmic birefringence for these ultralight ALP fields have focused on single-field models with conventional potentials. These models face exclusion due to the washout effect - a suppression of the CMB polarization power spectrum induced by oscillatory dynamics of the scalar field within the mass range of less than $10^{-23}$ eV. To address this limitation, we develop a more general theoretical framework incorporating two ALP fields, providing analytical approximations and numerical calculations. Our findings reveal that the superposition of two ALP fields with distinct masses can relax the constraints imposed by the washout effect and reconcile with observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21780v1" target="_blank"><h2>The rotation curve of the Milky Way measured by Classical Cepheids from Gaia DR3</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Qikang Feng, Yang Huang, Huawei Zhang, Jifeng Liu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table; Accepted for publication in MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We determine the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way in the range 6 < R < 18 kpc using a sample of 903 carefully selected classical Cepheids with precise proper motions and high-quality radial velocities from \emph{Gaia} DR3. Their distances can be accurately measured from the well-known Period-Wesenheit relations. The RC is computed from the three-dimensional velocity components of these Cepheids. Generally, the RC shows a slight decline with distance from the Galactic center. On top of this general trend, the newly constructed RC shows a dip around R ~ 10-11 kpc, followed by a bump around R ~ 13-14 kpc. This feature has also been reported in other RC measurements, mostly in RCs traced by young tracers like Cepheids. To better constrain the Milky Way mass, an averaged RC is then constructed by combining measurements from this work and previous efforts. Due to the ambiguous nature of the dip-and-bump feature, this averaged RC is constructed only within the radial range where the RC appears to be less influenced by this feature. By using this averaged RC, we determine the circular velocity at solar position and also build a parameterized mass model of our Milky Way. The result for the circular velocity at the solar position is $V_c(R_0) = 236.8 \pm 0.8\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which is in good agreement with previous measurements. The local dark matter density and the enclosed dark matter halo mass within 18 kpc are estimated from the averaged RC under different baryonic models, yielding a series of consistent results: a local density of $0.33-0.40\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and an enclosed mass of $1.19-1.45 \times 10^{11}\ M_\odot$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21739v1" target="_blank"><h2>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals II: A Spectral-Leakage-Aware Framework</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zi-Xuan Wang, Xing-Yu Chen, Ju Chen, Gong Cheng, Huai-Ke Guo, Andrew L.

However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $Σ$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $ΣR$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\,M_\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21738v1" target="_blank"><h2>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals I: Statistics Based on Time-Frequency Signal Tracks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zi-Xuan Wang, Gong Cheng, Ju Chen, Huai-Ke Guo, Andrew L.

Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $Σ$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21729v1" target="_blank"><h2>Golden and Silver Dark Sirens for precise H0 measurement with HETDEX</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yixuan Dang, Ish Gupta, Robin Ciardullo, Erin Mentuch Cooper, Shiksha Pandey, Dustin Davis, Surhud More, Rachel Gray, Hsin-Yu Chen, Daniel J.

In this work, we explore the potential of two subsets of sirens: rare golden dark sirens, for which a single galaxy dominates the H0 posterior, and silver dark sirens, which are far more common but have a larger set of plausible host galaxies. Using the fifth internal data release of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we assess the suitability of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for spectroscopic follow-up of dark sirens. VIRUS exposures of the standard HETDEX depth provide precise redshifts and exquisite completeness within z = 0.2. After a single year of observations with the upgraded LIGO-A# network, the combined sample of golden and silver dark sirens with z < 0.2 and follow-up VIRUS observations can potentially yield a few-percent constraint on H0. Our predictions suggest that spectroscopic redshift surveys such as HETDEX can play a key role in realizing high-precision cosmology with dark sirens in the near future. Standard-siren distance measurements offer a critical, fully independent path to the local value of H0 to resolve the Hubble tension.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21674v2" target="_blank"><h2>A systematic study on the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon emission features of nearby galaxies using AKARI near-IR spectra</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tsubasa Kondo, Hidehiro Kaneda, Shinki Oyabu, Takuma Kokusho, Toyoaki Suzuki, Risako Katayama, Eiko Kozaki, Itsuka Yachi, Keita Yoshida, Shohei Ono<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Interstellar hydrocarbon dust containing aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is believed to be processed by various factors including UV radiation fields and mechanical shocks in the galactic environments. We systematically investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust, especially the likely causes for the variations of the luminosity ratio of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, using the near-infrared (IR) spectral features at wavelengths 3.3 um and 3.4-3.6 um observed with AKARI/IRC. We analyzed 243 near-IR spectra of 240 star-forming (U)LIRGs (the total IR luminosity, $L_\rm{IR}>10^{11}\ L_\odot$), 119 spectra of 105 star-forming IRGs ($10^{10}\ L_\odot<L_\rm{IR}<10^{11}\ L_\odot$), and 94 spectra of 65 sub-IRGs ($L_\rm{IR}<10^{10}\ L_\odot$), in addition to 232 spectra of 36 Galactic HII regions as a reference sample. We performed near-IR spectral model fitting to estimate the luminosities of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon features and the HI recombination line Br$\rmα$. The result indicates that the luminosity ratios of the aliphatic to the aromatic hydrocarbons ($L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$) in the sample galaxies show considerably large variations, compared to those in the Galactic HII regions, $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$ systematically decreasing with $L_\rm{IR}$ and $L_\rm{Brα}$. We find that (sub-)IRGs with continuum colors bluer at 4 um tend to have higher $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to reflect the intrinsic nature of PAHs outside the HII region where the PAHs remain non-processed by strong UV radiation fields. We also find that some ULIRGs with continuum colors redder at 4 um show extremely low $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to be caused by blending aliphatic emission and absorption features due to the presence of an obscured galactic nucleus in merger systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21669v1" target="_blank"><h2>VLBI Diagnostics of Off-axis Jets in Radio Flares of Tidal Disruption Events</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tatsuya Matsumoto<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJ, comments welcome!!!<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21658v1" target="_blank"><h2>Particle production and Higgs reheating</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Aarav Shah, Kanabar Jay, Maxim Khlopov, Oem Trivedi, Maxim Krasnov<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $ξφ^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21632v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can A Kinematically Hot and Thick Disk Form A Bar? : Role of Highly Spinning Dark Matter Halos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sandeep Kumar Kataria<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 6 figure, submitted to ApJ, comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), high redshift (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21432v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Modal Approach to Constrain Inflation through Numerical Bispectra</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bowei Zhang, E.

Here, the longstanding separable \texttt{Modal} pipeline for constraining primordial bispectrum templates using WMAP and Planck CMB data has been supplemented by the more recently developed \texttt{Primodal} code to accurately calculate bispectra numerically from inflation models, showing great potential for enhanced computational efficiency; \texttt{Primodal} exploits the in-in separability of the tree-level in-in formalism, together with a separable mode-expansion technique to bypass the need for point-by-point bispectrum calculations. Building upon this progress, we propose a bispectrum pipeline that systematically explores the parameter space of inflationary Lagrangians, numerically computing the tree-level bispectrum (and power spectrum) for each scenario and comparing with the \texttt{Modal} bispectrum decompositions obtained from the Planck 2018 data. Our pipeline identifies and excludes disfavored scenarios through this analysis, providing direct constraints on the parameter space, the sound speed and other quantities from the surviving observationally viable scenarios. This is preparatory work for a planned analysis using much higher-resolution CMB data from the Simons Observatory. To validate our pipeline, we perform a proof-of-concept analysis of the IR DBI inflation model, obtaining constraints of $c_s \geq 0.073$ for the sound speed and $β\leq 0.39$ for the parameter space, demonstrating the pipeline's accuracy and effectiveness.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21415v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of the EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model on the Centaurus A ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray scenario</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Silvia Mollerach, Esteban Roulet<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We discuss the impact of the recent EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model on the scenario in which most of the cosmic rays with energies above 5 EeV originate in the nearby Centaurus A radiogalaxy. The heavier composition inferred when considering this hadronic model implies that the amount of H and He emitted by the source is reduced compared to what was found with previous hadronic models. The elements of the CNO group play a more predominant role in the instep region just above the ankle while the elements of the Si and Fe groups can contribute significantly in the suppression region of the energy spectrum above 50 EeV. We also obtain the predictions for the amplitude of the dipolar anisotropy in different energy bins above 4 EeV, showing that they can be well consistent with the measurements for appropriate values of the extragalactic turbulent magnetic field and source lifetime.

To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)>10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc). SDSS hosts are linked to the MPA-JHU catalogue for stellar masses and aperture-corrected total SFRs. TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-14.85$ ($\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts.

Building upon the formalism for GW-induced shear distortions, we develop a signal-to-noise framework that incorporates realistic survey characteristics, including cadence, angular resolution, and depth. We model the effective galaxy population using a redshift- and luminosity-dependent distribution to evaluate the noise power spectral density across the survey. Applying this framework to both LSST-like and idealized survey configurations, we derive characteristic strain sensitivity curves and identify the detectable parameter space for SMBHBs. We find that while current surveys are limited by angular resolution, an ideal full-sky survey with milliarcsecond-level precision and rapid cadence could detect continuous GW signals from SMBHBs at cosmological distances and partially bridge the PTA-LISA sensitivity gap.

GraviBERT is trained in two stages: a BERT-style pretraining phase, in which the model learns to predict masked segments in feature space to capture universal patterns and physics, followed by supervised fine-tuning for accurate parameter estimation. This approach demonstrates impressive improvement across multiple metrics compared to training from scratch. On in-domain data, it reduces the mean absolute error for point-estimate parameter inference by up to $30\%$, and training convergence accelerates by up to a factor of six. Moreover, at low signal-to-noise ratio, the mean relative precision of the inferred masses and distances reaches the few-percent level, while the mean absolute error in the effective spin is about $10^{-3}$. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, converging up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reducing estimation errors by up to approximately $45\%$, indicating that it learns sufficient detector-agnostic representations. Cross-approximant transfer demonstrates comparable performance, achieving up to $44\%$ reductions in mean absolute error across all parameters and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding 0.9 for mass parameters at signal-to-noise ratio 10, compared to 0.74 - 0.87 when training from scratch. Notably, GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms. The final regression head of the model can be adapted for a range of downstream tasks after pretraining, positioning it as a step towards foundation-style models in gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22267v1" target="_blank"><h2>Matter environments around black holes: geodesics, light rings and ultracompact configurations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dylan S.

In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21328v1" target="_blank"><h2>When Geometry Radiates Review: Gravitational Waves in Theory, Cosmology, and Observation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Azadeh Maleknejad<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 118 Pages, 41 Figs, Invited review for The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review.

This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21303v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bar Formation in Disc Galaxies: Internal Kinematics and Environmental Influence in MaNGA Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Erik Aquino-Ortíz, Bernardo Cervantes-Sodi, Karol Chim-Ramirez<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), kinematics (title), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore how the physical properties of disc galaxies relate to the presence of bars using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $λ_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21240v2" target="_blank"><h2>Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $γ$-ray Variability in CTA 102</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Agniva Roychowdhury<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, physics.plasm-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 8 figures.

Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $γ$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21216v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the Role of Vector Potential and Plasma-$β$ in Jet Formation from Magnetized Accretion Flows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ishika Palit, Miles Angelo Paloma Sodejana, Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 9 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we investigate how the choice of initial vector potential and plasma parameters influences the development of accretion columns and jet formation in magnetized accretion flows.

Combining this ansatz with the circular-motion condition yields a quadratic equation for $v(r)$ with a closed-form physical branch.We fit this ``velocity-coupled acceleration'' (\vca) model to $N_\mathrm{gal}=171$ rotation curves from the SPARC sample using the published baryonic decompositions (gas, disk, bulge), and we compare to two commonly used two-parameter halo models (NFW and Burkert) using an identical optimization pipeline and error model.For a fiducial systematic error floor $σ_0=5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the \vca model is typically competitive with an NFW halo and performs comparably (though not uniformly better) than a Burkert halo in information-criterion comparisons.We further perform MCMC inference for \vca parameters, quantify posterior predictive coverage, and show that parameter posteriors exhibit a strong $\vinf$--$\rzero$ degeneracy for many galaxies; only $47/171$ galaxies yield well-identified posteriors under simple width-based criteria.

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime.

In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21108v1" target="_blank"><h2>Axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Wataru Chiba, Ryusuke Jinno, Kimihiro Nomura<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages, 8 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields, focusing on the evolution of the photon intensity and polarizations induced by conversion into axions. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields characterized by the power spectra of their helical/non-helical components, we express the expectation values and variances of the photon intensity and linear/circular polarizations after conversion in terms of these spectra. We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields. We also point out consistency relations among these statistical quantities that hold independently of the specific forms of the magnetic field power spectra.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20999v1" target="_blank"><h2>DRAGNs in the Forest: Identifying Artifacts with Random Forest Models in the VLASS DRAGNs Catalog</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Verene Einwalter, Eric J.

The catalog of double radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) found in the VLASS first epoch Quick Look release using the DRAGNhunter algorithm suffers from contamination from these artifacts. These sources contain two or three individual components, each of which can be an artifact. We train random forest models to classify these DRAGNs based on the number of artifacts they contain, ranging from zero to three artifacts. We optimize our models and mitigate the class imbalance of our dataset with judicious training set selection, and the best of our models achieves a weighted F1 score of $97.01\%^{+1.12\%}_{-1.32\%}$.

To calculate the spectra, we utilize the Monte-Carlo based, 3-dimensional radiative transfer code SKIRT. The adopted geometry is the same as that of the IMPACT model (Ogawa et al. in prep.), consisting of a clumpy torus defined by Nenkova et al.

We discuss the dependence of the X-ray spectrum on geometrical parameters in comparison with the conventional torus-only model (XCLUMPY). As an example, we have simultaneously applied the IMPACTX and IMPACT models to the X-ray and infrared spectra of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, and have found a solution that can well reproduce both spectra.

This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. We combine 8 MIRI bands ($5-25$ $μ$m) of SMILES and archival 23-band HST+JWST NIRCam photometry to construct an extensive catalog containing 2,813 galaxies with sub-$μ$Jy level completeness in the mid-IR.

However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $μ=12.2$ for GW190521 and $μ=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20867v1" target="_blank"><h2>Universal relations between the quasinormal modes of neutron stars and magnetic tidal deformability</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hajime Sotani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, nucl-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Tidal deformabilities are one of the observable quantities characterizing neutron stars, which are strongly associated with the stellar compactness, the ratio of the stellar mass to the radius. In addition to the tidal deformability, the quasinormal modes excited in a neutron star are also an important property for extracting information about the neutron star interior, adopting gravitational wave asteroseismology. In this study, we especially focus on the magnetic tidal deformability, which acts on the gravitational waveform from a neutron star binary merger as a higher-order effect than the electric tidal deformability, and derive the universal relations expressing the quasinormal modes, such as the fundamental ($f$-), 1st pressure ($p_1$-), and 1st spacetime ($w_1$-) modes, as a function of the magnetic tidal deformability. The universal relations derived in this study exhibit accuracy more or less comparable to those of the electric tidal deformability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20832v1" target="_blank"><h2>Thawing Quintessence: Priors, evidence, and likely trajectories</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> David Shlivko<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 3 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-23<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We perform a Bayesian comparison between thawing quintessence and a cosmological constant, incorporating theoretically motivated priors on the phenomenological Padé-w parameters used to model thawing dynamics. We find that thawing quintessence is consistently preferred over a cosmological constant when combining BAO data from DESI DR2 and CMB data from Planck+ACT with any of the major supernova compilations, including the recently updated DES-Dovekie sample. This preference is not sensitive to our choice of prior, but it is contingent on the inclusion of supernovae in the analysis. We comment on the consistency between various information criteria and Bayesian evidence ratios, finding that the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) tracks the Bayesian evidence more reliably than either the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, we use observational likelihoods to identify which thawing trajectories are compatible with the available data, independently of theoretical priors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20786v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simultaneous JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA Monitoring of Sgr A*: A Unified Picture of the Variable IR, X-ray and Radio Emission</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20702v1" target="_blank"><h2>BASS.L.

This dataset is the largest compilation of rest-frame NIR spectroscopic observations of hard-X-ray-selected AGN and includes the full DR2 sample. Observations were obtained with VLT X-shooter, a multiwavelength (0.3$-$2.5$μ$m) spectrograph ($R$ = 4,000$-$18,000), using a $\geq 2 σ$ detection threshold, enabling broad analysis of emission features. We find that NIR coronal lines, particularly SiVI $\lambda1.964$, are more reliable tracers of AGN luminosity than optical [OIII], showing a tighter correlation with hard X-ray luminosity ($σ=0.25$dex) than [OIII] $\lambda5007$ ($σ=0.55$dex). Broad Paschen lines (Pa$α$ and Pa$β$) are detected in 12% of Seyfert 2 and 57% of Seyfert 1.9, consistent with previous hidden BLR studies. We introduce a refined NIR diagnostic diagram (FeII $\lambda1.257$$μ$m/Pa$β$ and H$_2$ $λ2.122$$μ$m/Br$γ$) that effectively distinguishes AGN, star-forming, and composite sources even when contamination limits individual diagnostics or only upper limits are available. Additionally, we find a moderate correlation ($p \approx 7.4 \times 10^{-3}$) between hot molecular gas mass (traced by H$_2$ 2.121$μ$m) and X-ray luminosity, while its relation with Eddington ratio is weaker. The hot-to-cold gas mass ratio spans four orders of magnitude, averaging $\sim 3 \times 10^{-7}$, indicating diverse molecular gas excitation processes likely driven by star formation and AGN feedback. Our results underscore the value of NIR spectroscopy in probing AGN activity, obscured BLRs, and the complex interactions between AGN and their circumnuclear environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20699v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparing next-generation detector configurations for high-redshift gravitational wave sources with neural posterior estimation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Filippo Santoliquido, Jacopo Tissino, Ulyana Dupletsa, Marica Branchesi, Jan Harms<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables.

In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20696v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quirks Live in Cool Universes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pouya Asadi, Graham D.

These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\text{RH} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $γ$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $ΔN_{\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20616v2" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Javier de Cruz Pérez, Adrià Gómez-Valent, Joan Solà Peracaula<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 4 Tables and 3 Figures.

We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced.

In this work, we assess the scientific reach of PUEO. In particular, we evaluate the sensitivity of this observatory to cosmogenic neutrinos and, in turn, to the proton fraction of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. We also consider the potential of PUEO to probe scenarios in which neutrinos are produced through the decays of ultraheavy dark matter particles or are radiated from cosmic strings. We find that PUEO will be able to constrain the proton composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays in scenarios that feature very strong source evolution and in which protons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Although gamma-ray observations are generally more sensitive to decaying particles than neutrino observations, PUEO is expected to set the strongest neutrino-detector constraints above 10^19 eV.
