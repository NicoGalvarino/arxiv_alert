  120 $z\sim3$ quasars covering the SDSS parameter space. Witnessing the
  instantaneous AGN feedback on halo scales</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jay González Lobos, Fabrizio Arrigoni Battaia, Aura Obreja, Guinevere Kauffmann, Emanuele Paolo Farina, Tiago Costa</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 23 figures.

Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) glows with diverse emission levels and extents.
These seem to depend on the activity of embedded quasars, the number of active
galactic nucleus (AGN) photons able to reach the halo gas or circumgalactic
medium (CGM) and the physical properties of the CGM. In this framework, we
present VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min/source) of 59 $z\sim3$ quasars
extending the long-term QSO MUSEUM campaign to fainter SDSS sources. The whole
survey now targets 120 quasars with a median redshift of $z$=3.13, and
bolometric luminosities, black hole masses and Eddington ratios of
$45.1<\log(L_{\rm bol}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}]}) < 48.7$, $7.9 < \log(M_{\rm BH}/[{\rm
M_{\odot}]}) < 10.3 $ and $0.01 < \lambda_{\rm Edd} < 1.8$, respectively. We detect
extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in 110/120 systems, with all non-detections in the
new fainter sample. Stacking non-detections unveils emission below our
individual detection limit. The Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness (SB$_{\rm
Ly\alpha}$) of the CGM increases with quasar luminosity. Moreover, the
Ly$\alpha$ linewidth increases in the central regions (projected radius $R < 40$
kpc or $\sim$40% $R_{\rm vir}$) of the CGM around brighter quasars. These
trends indicate that we are witnessing the instantaneous AGN feedback in action
on CGM scales. Assuming that all targeted quasars sit in halos of $M_{\rm
DM}\sim10^{12.5}\,M_\odot$, as found in clustering studies, the trend in
SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ can be explained by larger fractions of cool gas mass
illuminated, implying that brighter quasars have larger ionization cone opening
angles. Similarly, brighter AGNs seem to perturb the cool ($T\sim10^4$ K) gas
more strongly. We show that QSO MUSEUM now has enough statistics to study the
instantaneous AGN feedback while controlling for black hole properties, which
are key to constraining AGN models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16921v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA survey of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at $z\sim 3$. II. A

galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the
high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution
($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the
underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region
identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest
concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this
structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located
approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling
the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of
$2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a
high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This
makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically
cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected
separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal
interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a
satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our
spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3)
line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow
or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion
galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to
survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16112v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dissecting Reionisation with the Cosmic Star Formation and AGN

Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to
explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the
corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the
cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling
code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of
$f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could
have achieved reionisation by $z\approx 6$ with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim
10-30\%$, depending on the metallicity. On the other hand, AGN by themselves
would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with
$f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 100\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is
explored where we find best fit (median$\pm 1\sigma$) $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 12\%$

$\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN)
pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole
formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars
(SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $ < 10^6\,M_\odot$.
They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could
lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta
that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We
develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric
luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is
informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse
simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness
$\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the
source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes
them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots
and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in
long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs
up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS
explosions at $z < 11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down
to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based
on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to
image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep
fields.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13448v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dwarf Galaxies at Cosmic Noon: New JWST Constraints on Satellite Models

at $z \gtrsim 1$, enabling statistical constraints on galaxy evolution and the
galaxy$-$halo connection in a previously unexplored mass and redshift regime.
We compare satellite abundances at $1 < z < 3.5$ from recent JWST observations
with predictions from cosmological dark matter-only zoom-in simulations. We
identify and quantify several sources of biases that can impact theoretical
satellite counts, finding that assumptions about subhalo tidal evolution
introduce the largest uncertainty in predictions for the satellite mass
function. Using a flexible galaxy disruption model, we explore a range of
disruption scenarios, spanning hydrodynamically motivated and idealized
prescriptions, to bracket plausible physical outcomes. We show that varying
galaxy durability can change the predicted satellite mass functions by a factor
of $\sim3.5$. The JWST data and our fiducial model are consistent within
$1-2\sigma$ across the full redshift ($1 < z < 3.5$) and stellar mass
($M_\star> 10^7~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) range probed. We find evidence that subhalos
are at least as long-lived as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations. Our
framework will enable robust constraints on the tidal evolution of subhalos
with future observations. This work presents the first direct comparison
between cosmological models and observations of the high-redshift satellite
population in this low-mass regime. These results showcase JWST's emerging
power to test structure formation in the first half of the Universe in a new
domain and to constrain the physical processes driving the evolution of
low-mass galaxies across cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13435v1" target="_blank"><h2>Studying the gaseous outskirts of galaxy groups with coherent Ly alpha

residing in the outskirts of the four nearby, low-mass galaxy groups NGC1052,
NGC5866, NGC4631, and NGC3992 (all at cz < 2000 km/s) beyond their group virial
radii. Using archival ultraviolet absorption spectra of bright AGN observed
with HST/COS, we search for HI Ly a absorption near the groups' recession
velocities along 35 sightlines that pass the outer group medium (OGrM) at
normalized impact parameters rho/Rvir=1-3. We derive HI column densities of the
absorbers and constrain the physical conditions in the gas by using a
hydrostatic toy model of the groups' gas environment and assuming
photoionization. HI Ly absorption near the groups' recession velocities is
detected along 19 sightlines with HI column densities in the range log
N(HI)=12.50-14.34, implying a high OGrM detection rate of more than 50 percent.
We transform this value into an incidence rate of OGrM absorbers per unit
redshift of dN/dz=232pm58.This is 25 percent above the value derived for the
general population of Ly a absorbers within z = 0 filaments and more than twice
the value for the z = 0 Ly a forest. From the modeling, we obtain lower limits
for the gas densities from log n_H=-5.00 to -3.72, comparable to densities
found in the overall Ly a forest. Our study unveils a large cross section and
overdensity of Ly a absorbers in the outskirts of these four nearby groups.
Such an overdensity is in line with a previously proposed scenario, in which
AGN feedback lifts gaseous material to large distances beyond the virial radius
of groups into the OGrM. However, a larger survey of OGrM absorbers and a
comparison with hydrodynamical simulations will be necessary to constrain the
cosmological mass density of OGrM absorbers and pinpoint their role in
cosmological structure formation and galaxy/group evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16816v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar Mass-Dispersion Measure Correlations Constrain Baryonic Feedback

host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain
the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby
FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar
masses ranging from $10^9 < M^* / M_\odot < 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution
of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a
mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its
host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$
pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar
fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations
from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM
contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile
the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid
model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between
stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m > 0$) to the CGM are in tension
with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of
assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the
statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline.
Our results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback
in the Local Universe $(z < 0.2)$ in isolated $\sim L^*$ halos, complementing
results from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo
mass and redshift ranges.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16231v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ly$α$ Emission from [OIII] Emitters Near Reionization: The role of

baseline expectations for its detectability in the absence of attenuation by
neutral gas in the IGM. Towards this end, the growing numbers of $z \sim 5$--6
star-forming galaxies spectroscopically selected by JWST provide an ideal
sample for determining how Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on galaxy properties and
environment after reionization has largely completed. In this study, we use
Keck LRIS to measure the Ly$\alpha$ emission of 46 JWST-selected
[OIII]-emitting galaxies over $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$ in the foreground
of the ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802. Overall, we find that the fraction of
galaxies detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission is consistent with previous works;
however, the fraction also varies with environment. Most notably, we find an
apparent deficit of Ly$\alpha$ in the largest group in our sample, at $z \simeq
6.19$, which falls within the redshift range of the quasar's highly ionized
proximity zone. We speculate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from this group may
be partly scattered by a foreground neutral island. In contrast, we detect a
high rate of Ly$\alpha$ emission in two groups at $z \simeq 5.73$ and $z \simeq
5.78$. These groups may be part of a structure that is extended along the line
of sight, enhancing the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ emission. While our sample
size is limited, our results suggest that environment may play a significant
role in the detectability of galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission even as late as $z \sim
6$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14936v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring Spatially-Resolved Metallicities, Dynamics and Outflows in

on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies

high-resolution observations of two low-mass ($M_* < 10^9 \ M_\odot$),
low-metallicity ($[12 + \log(\text{O/H})] < 8$) galaxies at $z \sim 7.66$ with
evidence of hosting AGN. Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-frame optical
emission lines, we find flat metallicity profiles, indicative of ISM
redistribution by outflows or past merging. We identify kinematical components
decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of $\sim 250 - 500 \ \text{km}

possibly AGN-driven, for which we infer outflow rates of $\sim 21 - 40 \
M_\odot \ \text{yr}^{-1}$, suggesting they may suppress future star formation.
We compare our observational results to those from the new large-volume
AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole
growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of
$v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc}$ and $\dot{M}_\text{out}$/SFR are consistent with
the AGN population in these simulations, hinting that AGN-driven feedback may
contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of
low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study demonstrates the
necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and
morphology of high-$z$ galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of

insufficient observational constraints for simulations due to their low
precision and the lack of observations from $z \sim 0.4$ to $1.8$. The
Habitable Worlds Observatory, equipped with an ultraviolet (FUV / NUV)
spectrograph, could provide transformative data for this science by increasing
both absorbers in the redshift range where current data are lacking and
increasing the precision of the Ly$\alpha$ forest observational data at $z \leq
0.4$. This spectrograph should cover the wavelengths $1215-3402$ \AA~and have a

understand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic

gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and
efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular
gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich
systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent
galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly
weak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical
correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust
deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we
calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other
observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from
the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in
quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly
unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As
a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this

redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive "V-shaped" spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their
evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is
challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\it the
Saguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of
high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path
toward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus
surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1)
its nuclear spectrum shows a clear "V-shaped" SED; and (2) when redshifted to
$z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking
an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended
hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically
selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins
reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution.
A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can
explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\it the Saguaro} is not

Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a
distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a
short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red
appearance driven largely by observational biases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16917v1" target="_blank"><h2>Atomic hydrogen reservoirs in quiescent galaxies at z = 0.4</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host
lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints
have been derived so far at higher redshift (z>0.1). Understanding whether QGs
can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching
and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at
different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate
redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs
retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar
mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs.
Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36,
targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection
criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also
perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent
sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy
properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty
galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower
than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs
by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on
the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than
spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions
hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately
30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content
is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment
processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to
yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13498v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA FACTS III. High-Resolution CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) Maps of Twelve Nearby

and re-imaged CO(2-1) data from PHANGS. We make empirical classifications based
on the optical and molecular gas morphologies, which show clear systematic
trends in the variation of $R_{21}$ as a function of galactic structure. The
sample includes barred and unbarred, and flocculent galaxies. The barred spiral
galaxies follow a general trend: $R_{21}$ is high in the center, low along the
bar, increases at the bar ends, and then declines in the outer parts of the

molecular gas evolution, and consequently on star formation, in galaxies.
$R_{21}$ fluctuates in the spiral arms for both barred and unbarred galaxies.
HII regions increase $R_{21}$ locally in their surrounding gas and are often
associated with galactic structures. Together, $R_{21}$ varies systematically
as a function of galactic structure, dynamics, and star formation activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14337v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling the Reverberation Response of the Broad Line Region in Active

variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk
surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation
response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line
Region (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling
tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the
velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In
this work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization
models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated
the reverberation responses of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, MgII$\lambda$2800 and
CIV$\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian
rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses
generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted
radii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response
to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted
radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from
the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity
field. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile
shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can
reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial
flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud
emission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium. These competing
attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15942v1" target="_blank"><h2>The HETDEX Survey: Probing neutral hydrogen in the circumgalactic medium

halo of the LAE scattering Ly$\alpha$ photons from the integrated light of
background galaxies along the line of sight. We stack millions of spectra from

The extensive number of fiber spectra contributing to the stacks ensures
significant signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to detect the faint Ly$\alpha$

absorption out to a projected ~350 kpc around an average LAE at z~2.5. We use
these results to create an empirical radial $W_\lambda$(Ly$\alpha$) profile
around LAEs. Comparison with numerical simulations reveals a profile similar to
the empirical one within this region. Compared to previous studies, the profile
is similar but modestly higher. We also outline a simple physical picture
motivated by the observed trends in the data. We plan to quantify this radial

explore the relationship between LAE environments and H I distribution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17742v1" target="_blank"><h2>A first measurement of baryonic feedback with Fast Radio Bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Robert Reischke, Steffen Hagstotz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 8 figures, comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Baryonic feedback fundamentally alters the total matter distribution on small
to intermediate cosmological scales, posing a significant challenge for
contemporary cosmological analyses. Direct tracers of the baryon distribution
are therefore key for unearthing cosmological information buried under
astrophysical effects. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and
direct probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along
the line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of
the DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the
electron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a
model calibrated to the \texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we
forward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift. Applying this
model to approximately 100 localised FRBs, we constrain the governing feedback
parameter, $\log T_\mathrm{AGN}$. Our findings represent the first measurement
of baryonic feedback using FRBs, demonstrating a strong rejection of
no-feedback scenarios at greater than $99.7\,\%$ confidence ($3\sigma$),
depending on the FRB sample. We find that FRBs prefer fairly strong feedback,
similar to other measurements of the baryon distribution, via the thermal and
kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The results are robust against sightline
correlations and modelling assumptions. We emphasise the importance of accurate
calibration of the host galaxy and Milky Way contributions to the DM.
Furthermore, we discuss implications for future FRB surveys and necessary
improvements to current models to ensure accurate fitting of upcoming data,
particularly that from low-redshift FRBs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17752v1" target="_blank"><h2>Direct correlation of line intensity mapping and CMB lensing from

corners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright
foregrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments.
Cross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising
avenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe
of fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further
probe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our
understanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this
direct correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible
because smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright
foregrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of
foreground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting
lightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects.
Indeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the
lightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode
coupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly
varying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these
lightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing
cross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of
COMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this
cross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB
lensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of
LIM with any projected field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16707v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating realistic Lyman-$α$ emitting galaxies including the

companions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow,

Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) due to its proximity and comprehensive
multi-wavelength coverage. Using new Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data
from SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we analysed the galaxy's
nebular emission lines. Our study focused on spatially resolved line ratios and
Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagrams, revealing that the ''anomalous spiral
arms'' exhibit intense interactions between the jet and interstellar medium
(ISM) extending up to 6 kpc with velocity dispersions peak at 200-250 km/s in
these regions, contrasting with star-forming areas showing lower values around
of 30-50 km/s. Analysis of covering fractions indicates heightened AGN
ionization cones aligned with the radio jet, alongside evidence of shock
quenching observed in the lower "anomalous arc". Conversely, jet-induced
compression may stimulate star formation in other areas. We derived a
galaxy-wide star formation rate of $\sim3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ decreasing
to $0.3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ within the central $3.4 \mathrm{kpc}^2$.
SITELLE's broad field coverage elucidates the galaxy's structural details,
confirming that low-power jets significantly influence the host galaxy across
parsec and kpc scales. The velocity dispersion map reveals asymmetric or
double-peaked emission lines, tracing jet-disk interactions likely responsible
for the formation of anomalous arm features. Small-scale ionizing clusters were
detected in regions with disrupted gas flows, possibly formed through tidal
interactions or shock compression. NGC~4258 thus presents a compelling case for
studying LLAGN-driven feedback, illustrating how optical IFS combined with
multi-wavelength data clarifies the impact of outflows and shocks on nearby
spiral galaxies, providing insights into how these processes shape star
formation and ISM conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13456v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nature of High Equivalent Width Emitters in the Epoch of Reionization

contributors to cosmic reionization at $z>6$ due to their higher ionization
efficiencies. We have identified 119 H$\beta$ + [OIII] emitters at $z\sim7$
selected by a flux excess in the medium-band filter F410M in the public James
Webb Space Telescope Cycle-1 fields. Our emitters exhibit a wide range in
rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] equivalent width (EWs), 420 $<$ EW$_{0}$/\r{A} $<$
6850 (with the median value of $\sim1700$ \r{A}). Among them, 19 are EW$_{0}$
$>$ 3000 \r{A}, which represent extreme populations even in the context of
recent findings with JWST. They are characterized by (i) low stellar mass
($\sim 3\times10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), (ii) blue colors ($\beta_{\rm
UV}\sim -2.2$), and (iii) low dust attenuation ($A_{\mathrm{V}}\sim 0.1$ mag).
We discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed high rest-frame
H$\beta$ + [OIII] EWs, including (1) photoionization by AGN, (2) stellar
photoionization in the vicinity of HII regions, and (3) radiative shocks
powered by outflows either from AGN or massive stars. Notably, we find 13
emitters with spatially offset H$\beta$ + [OIII] emission compared to the UV
and stellar components. Given the absence of obvious signatures of actively
accreting black holes, these emitters are likely under strong feedback-driven
winds from massive stars. Lastly, we report a unique overdensity of EELGs in
one of the observed fields. The discovery of such a "star-bursting" overdensity
supports the idea that large ionizing bubbles formed around some EEGLs in the
early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16930v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tidal adaptive softening and artificial fragmentation in cosmological

gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an
artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale
Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly
apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at
small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations
induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the
suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian
perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown
to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we
investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for
dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the
severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly
improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a
fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious
haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial
conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo
formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening
counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore,
initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in
z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This
sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying
spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential
strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body
methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16902v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variable X-ray reverberation in the rapidly accreting AGN Ark 564: the

high-Eddington-ratio narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564, using over 900 ks of
\textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations spanning 13 years. The
time-averaged spectra can be well described by the a model consisting of a
coronal continuum, relativistic disk reflection, warm Comptonization, and three
warm absorbers. Leveraging the high X-ray brightness of Ark 564, we are able to
resolve the time evolution of the spectra and contemporaneous reverberation
lags. The soft-band lag relative to the continuum increases with the X-ray
flux, while Fe K$\alpha$ lags are detected in only a subset of epochs and do
not correlate with soft lags. Models based on a lamppost corona and reflection
from a standard thin disk can broadly reproduce the observed lag-energy spectra
of low-flux epochs; however, additional reverberation from the warm Comptonized
atmosphere is required to explain the soft lags observed in high-flux epochs. A
vertically puffed-up inner disk and a variable, vertically extended corona can
better explain the observed evolution of the lags and covariance spectra. Our
study underscores the importance of multi-epoch, multi-band analyses for a
comprehensive understanding the inner accretion disk and corona.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16245v1" target="_blank"><h2>The THESAN project: environmental drivers of Local Group reionization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yu Zhao, Aaron Smith, Rahul Kannan, Enrico Garaldi, Hui Li, Mark Vogelsberger, Andrew Benson, Lars Hernquist</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 21 figures, comments welcome, please visitthis http URLfor more details</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract), haloes (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The timing of cosmic reionization across Local Group (LG) analogues provides

Using the radiation-hydrodynamic simulation THESAN-1 and its dark matter-only

including 224 LG analogues within the proximity of any of the 20 Virgo-like
clusters with halo masses above 10^14 Msun at z=0 and their environments. The
statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift
(z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair
properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and
increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses
small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients
in z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings
out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant
factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and
correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to
large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous
reionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered
sources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density
regions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These
links between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of
protoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky
Way. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late)
as z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125
ckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization

Way (MW) analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$
relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a
Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this
behavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial
matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find
that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in
substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF)
resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high
masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is
sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the
SHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the
presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the
SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution.
Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and
their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus,
nonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using
DM substructure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16486v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intra-night optical variability and radio characteristics of extremely

Given their rarity we investigated intra-night optical variability (INOV) and

matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep
learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from
low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes
as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions
(HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution
baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines
these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including
displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained
on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with
\texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the
intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc
pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model
achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical
depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power
spectrum (\(k < 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in
the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model
reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed
particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the
potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating
high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets

T>10^6 K, which represents a major baryon reservoir. We here explore the
prospects of studying the hot coronal gas in Milky Way halo by analyzing the
highly forbidden optical coronal lines of [FeX] and [FeXIV] in absorption
against bright extragalactic background sources. We use a semi-analytic model
of the Milky Way's coronal gas distribution together wih HESTIA simulations of
the Local Group and observational constraints to predict the expected FeX and
FeXIV column densities as well as the line shapes and strengths. We predict
column densities of log N(FeX)=15.40 and log N(FeXIV)=15.23 in the Milky Way's
hot halo and estimate that a minimum S/N of 50,000 (25,000) is required to
detect [FeX] l6374.5 ([FeXIV] l5302.9) absorption at a 3sigma level. Using
archical optical data from an original sample of 739 high resolution AGN
spectra from VLT/UVES and KECK/HIRES, we generate a stacked composite spectrum
to measure an upper limit for the column densities of FeX and FeXIV in the
Milky Way's coronal gas. No [FeX] and [FeXIV] is detected in our composite
spectrum, which achieves a maximum S/N= 1,240 near 5300 A. We derive 3sigma
upper column-density limits of log N(FeX) < 16.27 and log N(FeXIV) < 15.85, in line
with the above-mentioned predictions. While [FeX] and [FexIX] absorption is too
weak to be detected with current optical data, we outline how up-coming
extragalactic spectral surveys with millions of medium- to high-resolution
optical spectra will provide the necessary sensitivity and spectral resolution
to measure velocity-resolved [FeX] and [FeXIV] absorption in the Milky Way's
coronal gas (and beyond). This gives the prospect of opening a new window for
studying the dominant baryonic mass component of the Milky Way in the form of
hot coronal gas via optical spectroscopy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17553v1" target="_blank"><h2>VERTICO IX: Signatures of environmental processing of the gas in Virgo

sample to date: 48 VERTICO spiral galaxies in Virgo. We show for the first time
in a significant sample that the physical conditions within the molecular gas
appear to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental processes. 13CO
is detected across the sample, both directly and via stacking, while C18O is
detected in a smaller number of systems. We use these data to study trends with
global and radial galaxy properties. We show that the CO/13CO line ratio
changes systematically with a variety of galaxy properties, including mean gas
surface density, HI-deficiency and galaxy morphology. 13CO/C18O line ratios
vary significantly, both radially and between galaxies, suggesting real
variations in abundances are present. Such abundance changes may be due to star
formation history differences, or speculatively even stellar initial mass
function variations. We present a model where the optical depth of the
molecular gas appears to change as a galaxy's ISM is affected by environmental
processes. The molecular gas appears to become more transparent as the
molecular medium is stripped, and then more opaque as the tightly bound remnant
gas settles deep in the galaxy core. This explains the variations we see, and
also helps explain similar observations in cluster early-type galaxies. Next
generation simulations and dedicated observations of additional isotopologues
could thus provide a powerful tool to help us understand the impact of
environment on the ISM, and thus the quenching of galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14072v1" target="_blank"><h2>Semi-supervised classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars using

cosmic structure and evolution, but the vast data from modern surveys make
manual classification impractical, while supervised learning methods remain
constrained by the scarcity of labeled spectroscopic data. We aim to develop a
scalable, label-efficient method for astronomical classification by leveraging
semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome the limitations of fully supervised
approaches. We propose a novel SSL framework combining K-means clustering with
Random Forest classification. Our method partitions unlabeled data into 50
clusters, propagates labels from spectroscopically confirmed centroids to 95\%
of cluster members, and trains a Random Forest on the expanded pseudo-labeled
dataset. We apply this to the CPz catalog, containing multi-survey photometric
and spectroscopic data, and compare performance with a fully supervised Random
Forest. Our SSL approach achieves F1-scores of 98.8\%, 98.9\%, and 92.0\% for
stars, galaxies, and quasars, respectively, closely matching the supervised
method with F1-scores of 99.1\%, 99.1\%, and 93.1\% while outperforming
traditional color-cut techniques. The method demonstrates robustness in
high-dimensional feature spaces and superior label efficiency compared to prior
work. This work highlights SSL as a scalable solution for astronomical
classification when labeled data is limited, though performance may degrade in
lower-dimensional settings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17637v1" target="_blank"><h2>Watching our Galaxy Grow Up: The Mass and Color Evolution of the Milky

evolution requires understanding what the Milky Way looks like "as a galaxy" --
that is, its "true" shape and abundance profiles (unskewed by observational
biases), signatures of past mergers and significant accretion events, and even
its total stellar mass and integrated SED, which have historically been
difficult to constrain. We present a new approach to determining the Milky
Way's integrated mass and colors, using recent measurements of the intrinsic
density profiles of stellar populations spanning nearly 13 Gyr in time and 1.5
dex in metallicity (representing nearly all of the Galaxy's stars). We trace
the evolution of the Milky Way in various diagnostic spaces, explore the impact
of specific events on the present-day Milky Way's integrated properties, and
use TNG50 simulations to identify "young" Galactic analogs and their eventual
fates, compared to the real Milky Way's path. From the simulation comparisons,
we find strong evidence for an earlier-than-average stellar mass assembly of
the MW, and that present-day MW analogs follow a similar growth history, albeit
at slightly later times; we also find that analogs of the early MW are in no
way guaranteed to follow the MW's subsequent path. This empirical study offers
new constraints on our "Galaxy as a galaxy" -- today and across cosmic time --

DESI galaxy groups by cross-correlating samples of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs)
and Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) galaxies with the publicly available CMB lensing
convergence map from ACT DR6. This provides an independent, lensing-based
calibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or
dynamics. We derive constraints on the mean halo mass for three DESI-selected
samples, finding $\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.18$, 13.03 and
13.02 for the Main LRG, Extended LRG, and BGS samples, respectively. Using a
halo model approach, we also compare the projected galaxy-matter density
profiles with previously reported gas profiles inferred from measurements of
the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This work addresses one of the
key uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass
distribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration.
The agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture
suggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we
recover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem.
We further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for
the most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h))
\approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement
with previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300
simulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius
by $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger
baryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of
combining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between
baryons and dark matter in group-sized halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14094v1" target="_blank"><h2>ChemZz I: Comparing Oxygen and Iron Abundance Patterns in the Milky Way,

measurements from both distant galaxies across redshift, and our own Milky Way
(MW). To form a comprehensive picture, it is essential to unify these
constraints, placing them on a common scale and parlance and to understand
their systematic differences. In this study, we homogenize oxygen and iron
measurements from star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z{\sim}2-3$) with
resolved stellar abundances from the Local Group. The MW is divided into four
components, assuming the outer halo is dominated by debris from the
Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor. After converting all abundances to a
common Solar scale, we identify clear $\alpha$- and iron-enhancement trends
with mass in the $z{\sim}2-3$ galaxies and find good agreement between these
galaxies and the MW high-$\alpha$ disc in [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]. We also find
excellent agreement between the [O/Fe] trends seen in the MW high- and
low-$\alpha$ discs with O-abundances seen in old and young planetary nebulae in
M~31 respectively, supporting the existence of $\alpha$-bimodality in the inner
regions of M~31. Finally, we use globular cluster ages to project the MW and
GSE back in time to $z{\sim}3$ and find that their estimated mass, oxygen and
iron abundances are strikingly consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of
star-forming galaxies at $z{\sim}3$. In the future, increased transparency
around the choice of Solar scale and abundance methodology will make combining
chemical abundances easier -- contributing to a complete picture of the

the optical depths of the 3.0-$\mu$m water ice -OH feature, the 3.4-$\mu$m

we present its application on observational data from the literature to
validate the measured optical depths and simulations to assess the accuracy of

from gravitational collapse of density fluctuations, represent a well-motivated
dark matter (DM) candidate. Their potential detection through gamma-ray
signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for
their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike
conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of
particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible
beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray
observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will
play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and
sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from
astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak
structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either
confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their
abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the
distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs,
focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where
Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based
analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single-
and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models
predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the
diagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and
constrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be
detectable above background.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17057v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AURORA Survey: Robust Helium Abundances at High Redshift Reveal A

establish a High$-z$ HeI Sample consisting of 20 galaxies with multiple
high-S/N ($>5\sigma$) HeI emission-line detections, including the critical
near-infrared $\lambda$10833 line. This is the first study at high redshift
leveraging $\lambda$10833 to break degeneracies between temperature, electron
density, optical depth, and He$^+$/H$^+$, enabling reliable He abundance

incorporating direct-method electron temperature priors, extended optical depth
($\tau_{\lambda3890}$) model grids up to densities of $10^6$~cm$^{-3}$, and
simultaneous fits of the physical conditions and HeI/HI line ratios to derive
ionic He$^+$/H$^+$ abundances. Most of the AURORA galaxies follow the
extrapolated $z\sim0$ He/H-O/H trend, indicating modest He enrichment by
$z\sim2-3$. However, we identify a subpopulation of four galaxies that exhibit
elevated He mass fractions ($\Delta Y>0.03$) without corresponding enhancements
in N/O or $\alpha$-elements ($\sim20$% of the sample). This abundance pattern
is inconsistent with enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars, but favors
early He enrichment from very massive stars (VMSs; $M\gtrsim100\ M_\odot$),
which can eject He-rich, N-poor material via stellar winds and binary stripping
in young stellar populations. We speculate that these elevated-He systems may
represent an early phase of globular cluster (GC) formation where N enrichment
is still lagging behind He production. This work demonstrates the power of JWST
multi-line HeI spectroscopy for tracing early stellar feedback, enrichment
pathways, and GC progenitor signatures in the high-z universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16932v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detection of a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sukanya Chakrabarti, Philip Chang, Stefano Profumo, Peter Craig</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), IGM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a

that this sub-halo has a mass of $1.02^{+3.47}_{-0.90} \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$
and is located at Galactic coordinates $d = 0.93^{+0.32}_{-0.38}$ kpc,
$b=36.78^{+17.59}_{-23.55}$, $l=30.16^{+19.36}_{-23.82}$, or equivalently at

\textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and
show that this excess power cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our

available acceleration measurements that span 3.4 kpc in Galactocentric radius
from the Sun and 3.6 kpc in vertical height, we find that massive (with mass
$>10^{8}~M_{\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several
kiloparsec of the Sun. The detection of a $10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ sub-halo within a
few kpc of the Sun is potentially consistent with the expected number counts of
sub-halos in the prevailing $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, for a substantial sub-halo
mass fraction. The pulsar accelerations are however better fit by a compact
object, such as arising from a primordial black hole or a sub-halo having a
steep density profile, as in self-interacting dark matter. As the number and
precision of direct acceleration measurements continues to grow, we will obtain
tighter constraints on dark matter sub-structure in our Galaxy. These

0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The
bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the
constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts
$\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value.
Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO

on the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding
problem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs)
have largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of
these baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback.
Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the
partitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is
sensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution
with feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates
how feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic
structures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web
method to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments,
sheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba
affect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that
in Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only
a few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces
noticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the
diffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a
new perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined
data model for the FRB foreground mapping.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17529v1" target="_blank"><h2>Through the fog: a complementary optical galaxy classification scheme

spectra. To date, the hydrogen Balmer lines remain the most consistent way to
classify galaxies, but at 'intermediate' redshifts ($1.5 < z < 2.5$), galaxies
are hard to parse in the BPT diagram (and its siblings) because the crucial
H$\alpha$ emission line is out of range of ground-based optical spectographs.
In this work, we re-explore a known diagram, which we call the OB-I diagram,
that compares the equivalent width of H$\beta$ with the emission line ratio of
[OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$, and breathe new life into it, as it has the
potential to 'illuminate the fog' that permeates galaxy classification in the
restframe optical spectra. Using data from SDSS, LEGA-C, VANDELS, JADES, 3D-HST
and MOSDEF, we explore galaxy classification in the OB-I diagram at a wide
range of redshifts ($0 < z < 2.7$). We find that, at $z < 0.4$, the OB-I
diagram clearly separates galaxies between two distinct types, which we divide
with an empirical fit: one dominated by AGN and a second made up of a mixed
population of SF galaxies and AGN activity. This mixed population can be
partially separated from a pure SF population, with a simple semi-empirical fit
derived from a comparison with theoretical models and the BPT diagrams. At
higher redshifts, we find that the majority of AGNs identified by other
classification schemes are correctly recovered by the OB-I diagram, potentially
making this diagram resistant to the 'cosmic shift' that plagues most optical
classification schemes. Overall, the OB-I diagram, which only requires two
emission lines to be implemented, is a useful tool at separating galaxies that
possess a dominating AGN component in their emission from others, from the
Local Universe ($z < 0.1$) to the Cosmic Noon ($z \sim 2$), without any need
for significant adjustments in our empirical fit.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17113v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quantifying the Impact of 2D and 3D BAO Measurements on the Cosmic
  Distance Duality Relation with HII Galaxy observation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jie Zheng, Da-Chun Qiang, Zhi-Qiang You, Darshan Kumar</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 3 figures, and 3 tables. Comments are welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is a fundamental and practical
condition in observational cosmology that connects the luminosity distance and
angular diameter distance. Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe
new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first
time, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data
with a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements.
The BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional
(3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different
parameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\eta(z)$, to investigate possible
deviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift
matching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a
model-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis
uniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO
sound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no
significant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either
the marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight
deviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with
$r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered
in this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the
tightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements,
which confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the
sound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves
its importance in CDDR tests. Finally, the consistency of our results supports
the standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17693v1" target="_blank"><h2>Estimating the baryon fraction in the IGM from well-localized FRBs and

Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI DR2), when combined with data from Type Ia
supernovae (SNe), challenge the observational viability of the $\Lambda$-Cold
Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, motivating combinations of independent
datasets to estimate cosmological quantities. In a previous communication, we
presented a cosmological independent method to constrain the baryon fraction in
the IGM ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$), where we derived relevant expressions for the
dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) in terms of luminosity distance, allowing us
to estimate $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ combining directly measurements of 17
well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe from the Pantheon catalog. Here we revisit
this method to constrain $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$, considering two parameterizations
for the $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$: constant and time-dependent. We expand our sample
by combining 107 well-localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with BAO measurements
from DESI DR2 and SNe observations from DESY5, and the Pantheon+ catalog. We
find through a Bayesian model selection analysis that a conclusive answer about
the evolution of $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ cannot be achieved from the current FRBs
observational data. In particular, our results show weak evidence in favor of
the constant case.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13904v1" target="_blank"><h2>The dynamical evolution of the stellar clumps in the Sparkler galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Eric Giunchi, Federico Marinacci, Carlo Nipoti, Adélaïde Claeyssens, Raffaele Pascale, Francesco Calura, Antonio Ragagnin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A; 16 pages, 4 pages of Appendix, 16 figures, 6 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4
gravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass $M_*\sim
10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular
clusters (GCs). However, most of their masses ($>10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and
sizes (>30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess
whether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of
their dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of
dynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied
performing multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of
mass $M_{200}\simeq 5\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (from the
stellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved
clumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the
same halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like
stellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass
$>10^7\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly
contributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass
distribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\times
10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive
clumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from
low-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of
present-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping,
their mass distribution peak shifts to $2\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$,
compatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the
Sparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might
become bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The
remaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13431v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining star formation in M87 using deep HST UV data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Prathamesh Tamhane, William Waldron, Ming Sun, Silvia Martocchia, Claudia Maraston, Alessandro Boselli, William Forman, Massimo Gaspari, Juhi Tiwari, Megan Donahue, G.

imaging of M87 to obtain the most robust constraints on its star formation rate
(SFR) and star formation history (SFH). After removing the galaxy continuum and
globular clusters, we detected an excess of UV point sources near the center.
By comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by
stochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we
ruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We
found an extremely low SFR of $\sim 2\times10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87,
with evidence of a weak starburst $\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\sim 1000$
M$_\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and
directly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and
H$\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history
suggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither
triggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier
outbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments
co-spatial with H$\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though
they are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered
by metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing
low-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that
AGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even
though some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot
created by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13794v1" target="_blank"><h2>Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in

primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark
matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way
halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially
last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to
detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale
gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using
nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events,
three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure
the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times
10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times

events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations
within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than
1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of
massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo.
Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction
of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other
compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as

astrobiological interest, including H$_{2}$S and complex organic molecules
(COMs). They are commonly observed in the gas phase toward star-forming
regions, but their detection in ices remains limited. Combining gas-phase
observations with chemical modeling is therefore essential for advancing our
understanding of their chemistry. In this paper we investigate the factors that
promote or hinder molecular complexity combining gas-phase observations of
CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O with chemical modeling
in two dense cores: Barnard-1b and IC348. We observed millimeter emission lines
of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O along strips using
the IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m telescopes. We used the gas-grain chemical model
\texttt{Nautilus} to reproduce the observed abundance profiles adjusting
parameters such as initial sulfur abundances and binding energies. H$_{2}$S,
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas-phase abundances vary up to one order of
magnitude towards the extinction peak. CH$_{3}$OH abundance remains quite
uniform. These abundances can only be reproduced assuming a decreasing sulfur
budget, which lowers H$_{2}$S and enhances CH$_{3}$OH abundances. Decreasing
binding energies, which are expected in CO-rich apolar ices, are also required.
The sulfur depletion required by H$_2$S is generally higher than that required
by CH$_3$OH, suggesting unknown sulfur sinks. These findings highlight the
intricate relationship between sulfur chemistry and COM formation, driven by
the competition between sulfur and CO for hydrogen atoms. Our study emphasizes
that the growth of CO ice and the progressive sequestration of hydrogen atoms
by sulfur are critical in determining whether chemical complexity can develop,
providing key insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14883v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Superclouds of the Local Milky Way</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lilly A.

understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight
into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the
largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of
seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local
$5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures
show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to
$10^6$ $M_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known
star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds,
primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are
precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show
an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the
Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary
by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\%$ only.
This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal
structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These
findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic
structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and
likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15699v1" target="_blank"><h2>A MeerKAT study of a neutral hydrogen rich grouping of galaxies with

serendipitously discovered large overdensity of HI galaxies at z~0.04. The
galaxies appear to lie in a filamentary-like structure of megaparsec scale.
MeerKAT's angular resolution and field of view allow us to spatially resolve
the HI galaxies while simultaneously probing large-scale structure. The HI and
sub-arcsec Dark Energy Survey (DES) imaging reveal a large number of
interacting galaxies in this collective group. MeerKAT data enables us to
derive HI masses and investigate interacting galaxies. We use DES and
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to quantify the star formation
rates, stellar masses, and stellar morphologies of member galaxies and compare
these with field scaling relations. To place this discovery and the
environmental effects in context, we use the SIMBA simulation to investigate
the prevalence of qualitatively similar HI overdensities and their large-scale
morphological properties. This enables a prediction of how frequently such
structures might be serendipitously discovered with MeerKAT and SKA-Mid HI
observations in comparable observation time. The combination of spatially
resolved HI data and optical imaging reveals a group rich in interactions,
suggesting environmental processes are already shaping galaxy properties within
the structure. More of these serendipitous discoveries are expected and,
alongside ongoing targeted programmes, these will provide a rich sample to
study galaxy transformation and enable a MeerKAT HI perspective on large-scale
structure, including filaments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14502v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA-IMF XIX: C18O (J=2-1): Measurements of turbulence in 15 massive

Array (ALMA) that aims to determine the origin of the core mass function (CMF)
of 15 massive Galactic protoclusters (~ 1.0-25.0 x 10^3 solar mass within ~ 2.5
x 2.5 pc^2 ) located towards the Galactic plane. In addition, the objective of
the program is to obtain a thorough understanding of their physical and
kinematic properties. Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with
C18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the
size-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s
show a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary
stage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such
values of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the
C18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature. In addition, we
compare the non-thermal velocity dispersions (sigma_nth, C18O) obtained from
the C18O(2-1) line with the non-thermal line widths (sigma_nth, DCN ) of the
cores obtained from the DCN (3-2) line. We observe that, on average, the
non-thermal linewidth in cores is half that of the gas surrounding them. This
suggests that turbulence diminishes at smaller scales or dissipates at the
periphery of the cores. Furthermore, we examine the size-linewidth relation for
the structures we extracted from the position-position-velocity C18O(2-1) line
emission cube with dendrogram algorithm. The power-law index (p) obtained from
the size-linewidth relation is between 0.41 and 0.64, steeper than the
Kolmogorov law of turbulence, as expected for compressible media. In
conclusion, this work is one of the first to carry out such a statistical study
of turbulence for embedded massive protoclusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15535v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inclination Effect on Observational Identification of Outflow Rotation

gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis indicates outflow rotation. The
rotation signature is clearly seen in the moment 1 map and a position-velocity
(PV) diagram across an outflow lobe made from our model with an inclination
angle of i>~85{degree sign}, as in observational studies of protostellar
outflows. Velocity projection with lower inclinations distorts the moment 1 map
because the outflow vertical (propagation) velocity contributes more to the
line-of-sight velocity, leading to an incorrect outflow axis direction. The PV
diagram adopting the incorrect outflow axis shows no clear velocity gradient.
These effects may prevent us from identifying outflow rotation. Our analysis
implies that rotational signatures can be obscured in ~2/3 to ~4/5 of the total
outflow population (i < 70{degree sign}-80{degree sign}), regardless of the
evolutionary stage. Complicated structures in observed outflows make it
difficult to determine the outflow, which may result in the apparent

a significant difference in the distributions between mergers' and non-mergers'

is very weak. For the low-mass sample, mergers possess higher SFR, SSFR than
non-mergers when the group richness is kept constant, while for high-mass poor
group galaxies have higher SFR, SSFR than rich group galaxies when merging
status is kept constant. Mergers resemble young stellar populations and are
bluer than non-mergers for low-mass, while for high-mass, mergers and

Submitted to JCAP</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic
times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the
many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we
tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and
data-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski
equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of
BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the
latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then
constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local
BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz
stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array
(PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are
strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher
normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative
efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution.
Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\lesssim
10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST,
and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. Relatedly, we
highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH
demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as
predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's
contribution to $\lesssim 30-50\%$ at $\sim 3\sigma$, suggesting that either
systematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or
that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the

the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) due to orbital motions of the
two galaxies in a merging system. After considering no physical connections
between two independent narrow emission line regions in two galaxies in one
DGS, there should be no correlations between flux ratios $R_{R}$ of red-shifted
narrow emission components from one galaxy and flux ratios $R_{B}$ of
blue-shifted narrow emission components from the other galaxy in the DGS.
However, after checking the large sample of DPNELs in the SDSS, there are
strong linear correlations in different groups between $R_{R}$ as the flux
ratio of red-shifted narrow [O~{\sc iii}] to the red-shifted narrow H$\alpha$
and $R_{B}$ as the flux ratio of blue-shifted narrow [O~{\sc iii}] to the
blue-shifted narrow H$\alpha$. Meanwhile, after checking narrow emission line
properties of galaxy pairs within 30 (20, 10) arcmins, there are no connections
between narrow emission line fluxes in the galaxy pairs, to support the
detected linear correlations being robust enough between $R_{R}$ and $R_{B}$ in
the DPNELs in SDSS. Furthermore, through oversimplified simulations, at least
more than 60% of the DPNELs should be not related to the expected DGSs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14993v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optical spectroscopy of blazars for the Cherenkov Telescope Array

{\gamma}-ray sources. They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the
recent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are
nearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts.
Consequently, nearly half of the {\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift
measurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for
studying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\gamma}-ray
propagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on
IGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series
dedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key
targets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory
(CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\gamma}-ray blazars
detected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These
blazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of
exposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the
results of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT,
Keck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for
spectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host
galaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the
magnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light
curves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a
moderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars,
ranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z >
1.0196 and z > 1.4454. The remaining 15 BL Lac objects exhibited featureless

present a spatially resolved analysis of 189 galaxies at redshifts $z \sim
6.7-7.6$ in JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields and selected via JWST/NIRCam F410M
filter. By employing annular photometry and spectral energy distribution
fitting across rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths, we investigate the
internal structure of star formation, ionizing photon production and escape, as
well as the resolved star formation histories within these galaxies. We find
that these galaxies exhibit compact, centrally concentrated, and bursty star

The central regions of them display extreme [OIII]+H$\beta$ equivalent widths

\sim 10^{25.6}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$), steep UV slopes ($\sim -2.3$), and elevated
escape fractions ($f_{\text{esc}} > 0.08$), with all these properties peaking
in the inner regions. These findings reveal outside-in growth and rising star

galaxy clusters detected with the AMICO code, in the fourth data release of the
Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). The analysed sample comprises about 8000
clusters, covering an effective area of 839 deg$^{2}$ and extending up to a
redshift of $z = 0.8$. Stacked cluster weak-lensing and count measurements have
been derived in bins of redshift and intrinsic richness, $\lambda^*$. Based on
self-organising maps, we reconstructed the true redshift distributions of the
background galaxy samples. We accounted for the systematic uncertainties
arising from impurities in the background and cluster samples, biases in the
cluster $z$ and $\lambda^*$, projection effects, halo orientation and
miscentring, truncation of cluster halo mass distributions, matter correlated
with cluster haloes, multiplicative shear bias, baryonic matter, geometric
distortions in the lensing profiles, uncertainties in the theoretical halo mass
function, and super-sample covariance. We also employed a blinding strategy
based on perturbing the cluster sample completeness. The improved statistics
and photometry compared to the previous KiDS data release, KiDS-DR3, have led
to a halving of the uncertainties on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, as we
obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.22\pm0.02$ and $\sigma_8=0.86\pm0.03$. The
constraint on $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$,
$S_8=0.74\pm0.03$, is in excellent agreement with recent cluster count and
KiDS-1000 cosmic shear analyses, while it shows a $2.8\sigma$ tension with
Planck cosmic microwave background results. The constraints on the
$\log\lambda^*-\log M_{200}$ relation imply a mass precision of 8%, on average.
In addition, the result on the intrinsic scatter of the $\log\lambda^*-\log
M_{200}$ relation, $\sigma_{\rm intr}=0.05\pm0.02$, confirms that $\lambda^*$
is an excellent mass proxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12993v1" target="_blank"><h2>Supersonic Turbulence in Primordial Halos: A Comparison With and Without

clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host
Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark
matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in
the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects
the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological
simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at
a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M
\lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M
\gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely
arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while
the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing
accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence
suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the
presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation
and the resulting star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16700v1" target="_blank"><h2>The GHOSDT Simulations: II. Missing Molecules in Simulations of a

HI-to-H$_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P_{\rm

conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar
medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R_{\rm mol}\equiv M_{\rm
H_2}/M_{\rm HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of
$\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range
of $100-0.25\ M_{\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\sim 20-0.05\
\rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling
choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova
energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a
model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R_{\rm mol}$ is not converged even
at a resolution of 1 $M_{\odot}$, with $R_{\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of
2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\ M_{\odot}$. Models excluding
either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in
$R_{\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\rm
mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\rm mol}$ by a
factor of $\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the
time-averaged $R_{\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle
value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable
to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that
small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$_2$ formation
even in high-resolution numerical simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16552v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low D/H ratio for benzonitrile in TMC-1: Implication for the origin of

(up to 24 carbon atoms) in cold dark clouds, although it is currently unknown
whether they are formed in situ through a bottom-up mechanism or from larger
PAHs (20-100 carbon atoms) inherited from a previous diffuse stage in a
top-down scenario. Infrared observations have recently shown that large PAHs
present in UV-illuminated regions are strongly enriched in deuterium. In order
to shed light on the origin of PAHs in cold clouds, we have searched for
deuterated benzonitrile in the cold dark cloud TMC-1. To that purpose we have
synthesized the three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) of monodeuterated
benzonitrile, measured their rotational spectra across the 2-18 GHz and 75-110
GHz frequency ranges in the laboratory, and searched for them in TMC-1 using
data from the QUIJOTE line survey. We did not detect any of the three species
and have derived a 3sigma upper limit on the column density of each of them of
3.0e10 cm-2, meaning a fractional abundance relative to H2 of < 3e-12. We
derived a D/H ratio (which we define as the total number of D atoms with
respect to the total number of H atoms present in benzonitrile) of < 1.2 %. This
value is in line with the range of D/H ratios observed for other molecules in
TMC-1 (0.06-3.3 %), where deuterium enrichment is explained in terms of
isotopic fractionation at low temperature. It is however below the range of D/H
ratios derived for large unspecific PAHs from JWST observations of the galactic
PDRs Orion Bar and M17 and the galaxies M51 and NGC3256-S (between 1% and
< 17%). Although it is not straightforward to compare the deuteration of PAHs in
dark and UV-irradiated clouds, our results suggest that the population of PAHs
detected in cold dark clouds does not result from the fragmentation of larger
PAHs inherited from the previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15944v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measuring and modelling the Splash with APOGEE/Gaia and ARTEMIS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shobhit Kisku, Ricardo P.

chemo-dynamical properties of the Splash population in comparison with those of
the high-alpha disc. We investigate a wide range of abundance ratios, finding
that the Splash differs from the high-alpha disc overall. However, these
differences result from a smooth variation of chemical compositions as a
function of orbital properties. The Splash occupies the high-alpha,
high-[Al,K/Fe], and low-[Mn/Fe] end of the high-alpha disk population. In
agreement with previous studies, we find that Splash stars are distributed over
large heights from the Galactic mid-plane. To further elucidate the relation
between the Splash and the high-alpha disk, we turn to simulations. Using a
sample of Milky Way-like galaxies with and without major accretion events from
the ARTEMIS simulations, we find that Splash-like populations are ubiquitous,
though not always resulting from major mergers. Lower mass progenitors can also
generate Splash-like features, as long as they are on retrograde orbits.
Moreover, we find a strong correlation between the mass fraction of Splash
stars and the fraction of retrograde accreted stars in the disk. Some galaxies
with minor (retrograde) mergers contain more pronounced Splash populations than
others with major, but prograde, mergers. For stars in the high-alpha disks, we
also find a decrease in the [alpha/Fe] with increasing orbital angular
momentum. This trend is found in hosts with both major or minor mergers. Our
results suggest that a number of relatively low-mass mergers on retrograde
orbits could result in populations that are qualitatively similar to the
Splash.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14338v2" target="_blank"><h2>AMICO galaxy clusters in KiDS-1000: cosmological sample</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M. Maturi, M.

We present a catalog of galaxy clusters detected in the Kilo-Degree Survey
(KiDS-DR4) optimized for cosmological analyses and investigations of cluster
properties. Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for
the KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range $15 < r' < 24$. Methods. Using the
Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we
identified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the
redshift range $0.1\le z \le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The
sample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive
galaxy selection criteria we adopted. Spectroscopic data from the GAMA survey
were used to calibrate the clusters photometric redshift and assess their
uncertainties. We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate
border effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each
cluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been
estimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong
assumptions embedded in numerical simulations. We introduced a blinding scheme
of the selection function meant to support the cosmological analyses. Results.
Our cluster sample includes 321 cross-matches with the X-ray eRASS1 "primary"
sample and 235 matches with the ACT-DR5 cluster sample. We derived a mass-proxy
scaling relation based on intrinsic richness, $\lambda_*$, using masses from
the eRASS1 catalog. Conclusions. The KiDS-DR4 cluster catalog provides a
valuable data set for investigating galaxy cluster properties and contributes
to cosmological studies by offering a large, well-characterized cluster sample.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16931v1" target="_blank"><h2>An analytic formalism to describe the $N_{\rm eff}(\rm H)$-$n_{\rm H}$

Astrochemical modeling requires, as input, the effective column
density of gas (or extinction) that attenuates an external, isotropic,

calculated through ray-tracing schemes, while in 0D chemical models it is often
treated as a free parameter. Aims. We aim to produce an analytic, physically

and is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across
its various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical
evolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from
an existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and
most metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation
(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex
in metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major
merger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in
the Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have
experienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our
previous works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of
wing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned
merger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the
clouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge
formations.
  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample
that includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the
expectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show
a trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models
that best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with
the major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we
suggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters,
which can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic
chemical enrichment over time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16925v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the Masses of the Two Most Distant Gravitational Lensing

most transformative changes during the $z = 1.5 - 2$ epoch. However, challenges
such as low lensing efficiency, high shape measurement uncertainty, and a
scarcity of background galaxies have prevented us from characterizing their
masses with weak gravitational lensing (WL) beyond the redshift $z\sim1.75$. In
this paper, we report the successful WL detection of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122 at
$z=1.80$ and $z=1.98$, respectively, utilizing deep infrared imaging data from
the Hubble Space Telescope with careful removal of instrumental effects. These
are the most distant clusters ever measured through WL. The mass peaks of JKCS
041 and XLSSC 122, which coincide with the X-ray peak positions of the
respective clusters, are detected at the $\sim3.7\sigma$ and $\sim3.2\sigma$
levels, respectively. Assuming a single spherical Navarro-Frenk-White profile,
we estimate that JKCS 041 has a virial mass of $M_{200c} = (5.4\pm1.6) \times
10^{14} M_{\odot}$ while the mass of XLSSC 122 is determined to be $M_{200c} =
(3.3\pm1.8) \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$. These WL masses are consistent with the
estimates inferred from their X-ray observations. We conclude that although the
probability of finding such massive clusters at their redshifts is certainly
low, their masses can still be accommodated within the current $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15834v1" target="_blank"><h2>SDSO1 is a Ghost Planetary Nebula Bow Shock in Front of M31</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Patrick Ogle, Mark Petersen, Tim Schaeffer, Lewis McCallum, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, R.

instead a bow shock driven by a faded, giant (D = 20 pc), 400 kyr-old, ghost
planetary nebula (GPN) expelled by the symbiotic WD binary star EG Andromedae.
Because EG And lags the rotation of the Milky Way, its hypersonic velocity of
107 km/s drives a shock into the local interstellar medium. SDSO1 also sports a
45-pc long turbulent tail that crosses M31. We establish the shock-powered GPN
phase as a new phase of PN evolution, and identify seven more candidate GPNe by
their large size and shock-tail morphology. This includes several giant halos
of younger planetary nebulae, possibly expelled by now degenerate binary
companions. The interaction of an old, fast-moving GPN with the ISM generates a
shock that remains visible long after the photoionized PN shell has faded below
the limit of detectability. The SDSO1 GPN has reached a phase in its evolution
where its outward expansion has been slowed considerably by the work it has
done on the interstellar medium. Once the GPN outflow expends the rest of its
kinetic energy, it will be stripped from EG And and mix into the surrounding

cluster. In the shallow fields, using the ratio of evolved Asymptotic Giant
Branch and Red Giant Branch stars out to $\sim$13 kpc along F8D1's known
stellar stream, we confirm that F8D1 was globally star-forming until at least 2
Gyr ago. We estimate a total progenitor stellar mass, including the stream, of
$\sim$1.3$\times$10$^8\ M_{\odot}$, with an average [M/H] $\sim$ $-$0.8. We
compare F8D1's properties to those of Local Group galaxies with similar initial
stellar mass. We find that F8D1 is consistent with a progenitor star-forming
galaxy similar to NGC 6822, which is in the midst of a transition to a
Sagittarius-like system. Notably, this evolutionary sequence can be
accomplished through tidal processing alone, in galaxies that have experienced
sufficiently bursty feedback to create cored profiles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13488v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling M33's Hidden Merger History: A Potential Population of Star

appear to follow retrograde orbits around the third largest galaxy in the Local
Group, M33 (Triangulum). This spiral disk galaxy has apparently had a mostly
quiescent existence, although recent discoveries, particularly of a pronounced
warp in the gas and stellar disk, suggest that M33's relatively quiet past was
interrupted at least once by a dynamical interaction with another galaxy. We
suggest that this sub population provides evidence of accretion of one or more
dwarf galaxies in M33's history. We estimate a lower limit for the accreted
halo virial mass of $M_{\rm vir} \sim (7 \pm 3) \times 10^{10}$\msun,
accounting for about 10\% of the virial mass in the halo of M33 that has an
accretion origin. We propose one of these accretion events as the source of the
observed warp in M33's disk.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15819v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid preparation: Expected constraints on initial conditions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Euclid Collaboration, F.

spiral galaxies, but their formation histories are not yet understood, which is
particularly true for thick discs. This is partially due to the fact that we
lack sufficient understanding of thin and thick discs in other galaxies to
determine how common features of the Milky Way's discs are. Here, we conduct an
integral field spectroscopy study of the thin and thick discs in the edge-on
Milky Way analogue IC 2531, using observational data from the WiFeS IFU
spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope. We provide spectral analysis of IC
2531's kinematics and stellar populations in the thin and thick disc regions by
conducting pPXF fitting with Vazdekis models. We found that IC 2531's disc
above the dust plane generally has chemical properties between the Milky Way's
chemical thin and thick disc. IC 2531's thick disc is somewhat similar to the
Milky Way's in terms of stellar populations: on average, it is older, more
metal-poor than its corresponding thin disc, but similarly alpha-enhanced in
general. But we do find a clearly alpha-rich thick disc bin though one of our
"thick disc" bins may be dominated by a warped thin disc. These results may
help to constrain formation theories of thick discs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16098v2" target="_blank"><h2>Testing gravitational physics by combining DESI DR1 and weak lensing

constrain the excess surface mass density of voids using weak lensing. We
present and validate a novel method for computing the Gaussian component of the

detect the stacked weak lensing void density profile at the $6.2\sigma$ level,
the most significant detection of void lensing from

have different matter density profiles, as expected from numerical studies of
void profiles. This difference is significant at the $2.3\sigma$ level.
Comparing the void profile to a measurement of the void-galaxy
cross-correlation to test the linearity of the relationship between mass and
light, we find good visual agreement between the two, and a galaxy bias factor
of $2.45\pm0.36$, consistent with other works. This work represents a promising
detection of the lensing effect from underdensities, with the goal of promoting
its development into a competitive cosmological probe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13014v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA discovery of Punctum -- a highly polarized mm source in nuclear

sources, yet only one - located approximately 3.4" (~60 pc) from the galactic
center and unresolved with ~0.1" resolution - exhibits an unusually high
polarization degree of 50% $\pm$ 14%, likely originating from non-thermal
synchrotron radiation. The source is faint, yet clearly detected in two
separate epochs of observation taken 14 days apart, with flux of 0.104 $\pm$
0.018 and 0.125 $\pm$ 0.016 mJy, as well as in earlier ALMA observations,
showing no variability at any timescale. The spectral index remains stable
within large uncertainties, -1.8 $\pm$ 2.5 and -1.3 $\pm$ 2.5. The source,
which we further refer to as Punctum due to its compactness, revealed no clear
counterparts in existing X-ray or radio observations. Assuming association with
the central region of NGC 4945, we estimate upper limits for its luminosity of
~1 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 3-6 keV X-ray band (from archival
Chandra data) and ~5 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 23 GHz (from archival

properties with known astrophysical sources emitting synchrotron radiation,

of stellar kinematic structure of barred galaxies: the angular distributions of
the radial and azimuthal components of stellar velocities, and the impact of
bars on rotation curves. We find that stars on bar-supporting $x_1$-like orbits
exhibit characteristic sawtooth-like radial velocity patterns and arch-like
tangential velocity patterns as a function of azimuth. In contrast, stars on
box and disk orbits show little azimuthal variation, effectively smoothing the
overall velocity distribution. When averaged over all orbital families, the
resulting kinematics are broadly consistent with the bisymmetric model of
Spekkens & Sellwood, with the amplitudes of bar-induced velocity perturbations
increasing with bar strength. In addition, bars amplify the radial pressure
gradient associated with enhanced random stellar motions, leading to a
noticeable reduction in the mean rotational velocity. This effect becomes more
pronounced with increasing bar strength, resulting in a shallower rotation
curve within the bar region. We discuss our results in the context of the
kinematic properties of observed barred galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16590v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inference of matter power spectrum at z=0 using DESI DR1 Full-Shape data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R.

Specifically, we reconstruct the 3D matter power spectrum at redshift $ z = 0 $

clustering data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, assuming
the $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ model, and compare it to the result assuming the $

account for small-scale effects in the 2-point statistics of galaxy data. The
EFT approach offers a more robust methodology than traditional methods for
modelling the galaxy power spectrum from galaxy clustering data, which can be
used to test the consistency of the assumed cosmological model. By
incorporating both CMB and galaxy clustering data across a range of redshifts,
we can identify discrepancies between the datasets, which would indicate

To
interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic
variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or
inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven
realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky
Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share
the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random
numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global
galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history,
masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar
disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that
magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In
contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the
internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and
orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the
main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first
pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all
matter components in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly
more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are
systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different
numerical resolutions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17243v1" target="_blank"><h2>Environmental Effects on Galaxy Evolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ziqi Mu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, stat.AP</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), SDSS (abstract), galaxy evolution (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies evolve within a web-like cosmic structure, and their properties are

particular, galaxies in VoidFinder voids tend to be fainter, less massive, and

observational probes to constrain models of interacting dark energy (IDE). By
leveraging FRB dispersion measures (DMs) and redshifts, we perform a
comprehensive analysis of three IDE models: gamma_m IDE, gamma_x IDE, and xi
IDE, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on 86 localized FRBs
and simulated datasets containing 2500 to 10000 mock events. By disentangling
the contributions to the observed DMs from the Milky Way, host galaxies, and
the intergalactic medium (IGM), key cosmological parameters are constrained,
including the Hubble constant (H0), matter density (Omega_m), the dark energy
equation of state (omega_x), and interaction strengths (gamma_m, gamma_x, xi).
The best-fit values of the gamma_m IDE model indicate a potential alleviation
of the cosmic coincidence problem. Subsequently, we utilize information
criteria (IC) to conduct a comparative assessment of the three IDE models. When
applied to the current sample of observed FRBs, the xi IDE model yields
slightly lower IC values than the gamma_m IDE and gamma_x IDE models across all
three criteria, although the differences are not statistically significant.
These results underscore the value of FRB measurements as complementary probes
that provide further constraints on alternative cosmological models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16745v1" target="_blank"><h2>Artifacts in Halo Shapes: Imprints of the Initial Condition</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yu Yu, Zhao Chen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 9 figures.

Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon
Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia
SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018. The results
show statistically significant signal for positive dark matter equation of
state and square of sound speed $w_{\rm dm}=c_{\rm s,dm}^2$ ($10^{7}w_{\rm dm}$
= $4.0^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ at the 95\% confidence level) for the data combination
CMB+DESI+PP+RSD. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that this data
combination favors the $\Lambda$CDM model with very strong evidence.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12754v1" target="_blank"><h2>Breaking the Mass-sheet Degeneracy in Time-delay Cosmology with Lensed

issue of mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in time-delay cosmography by incorporating
observations of both gravitationally lensed and unlensed Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia). By simultaneously using lensing magnification measurements
$\mu^{\rm{obs}}$ and cosmic distance ratios ($D_s/D_{ds}$), we develop a
Bayesian framework capable of breaking the MSD. Specifically, we reconstruct
the distance-redshift and magnitude-redshift relations from unlensed Type Ia
supernovae using Gaussian process to avoid dependence on specific cosmological
models. Our framework shows substantial efficacy in resolving the MSD by
imposing constraints on the MSD parameter $\lambda$. Furthermore, we extend
this framework to analyze multiple gravitational lensing systems. The results
show strong agreement with the fiducial MSD parameters used in the data
simulation, confirming our method's effectiveness in mitigating the MSD.
Ultimately, this technique enables the derivation of corrected time-delay
distance measurements under the MSD, improving the precision of cosmological
parameters inferred from strong lensing systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15209v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Optimal In-Situ Multipole Algorithm for the Isotropic Three-Point
  Correlation Functions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wenjie Ju, Longlong Feng, Zhiqi Huang, Xin Sun, Weishan Zhu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), Euclid (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an optimised multipole algorithm for computing the three-point
correlation function (3PCF), tailored for application to large-scale
cosmological datasets. The algorithm builds on a $in\, situ$ interpretation of
correlation functions, wherein spatial displacements are implemented via
translation window functions. In Fourier space, these translations correspond
to plane waves, whose decomposition into spherical harmonics naturally leads to
a multipole expansion framework for the 3PCF. To accelerate computation, we
incorporate density field reconstruction within the framework of
multiresolution analysis, enabling efficient summation using either grid-based
or particle-based schemes. In addition to the shared computational cost of
reconstructing the multipole-decomposed density fields - scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(L^2_{\text{trun}} N_g \log N_g)$ (where $N_g$ is the number of
grids and $L_{\text{trun}}$ is the truncation order of the multipole expansion)
- the final summation step achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(D^6_{\text{sup}} N_g)$ for the grid-based approach and
$\mathcal{O}(D^3_{\text{sup}} N_p)$ for the particle-based scheme (where
$D_{\text{sup}}$ is the support of the basis function and $N_p$ is the number
of particles). The proposed $in\, situ$ multipole algorithm is fully
GPU-accelerated and implemented in the open-source $Hermes$ toolkit for cosmic
statistics. This development enables fast, scalable higher-order clustering
analyses for large-volume datasets from current and upcoming cosmological
surveys such as Euclid, DESI, LSST, and CSST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16714v1" target="_blank"><h2>Planck constraints on the scale dependence of isotropic cosmic
  birefringence</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M. Ballardini, A. Gruppuso, S. Paradiso, S. S. Sirletti, P. Natoli</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The rotation of the linear polarisation plane of photons during propagation,
also known as cosmic birefringence, is a powerful probe of parity-violating
extensions of standard electromagnetism. Using Planck legacy data, we confirm
previous estimates of the isotropic birefringence angle, finding $\beta \simeq
0.30 \pm 0.05$ [deg] at 68% CL, not including the systematic error from the
instrumental polarisation angle. If this is a genuine signal, it could be
explained by theories of Chern--Simons-type coupled to electromagnetism, which
could lead to a harmonic scale-dependent birefringence signal, if the
hypothesis of an ultra-light (pseudo) scalar field does not hold. To
investigate these models, we pursue two complementary approaches: first, we fit
the birefringence angle estimated at different multipoles, $\beta_{\ell}$, with
a power-law model and second, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian
reconstruction of it. Both methods yield results consistent with a
non-vanishing constant birefringence angle. The first method shows no
significant dependence on the harmonic scale (up to $1.8\sigma$ CL), while the
second method demonstrates that a constant model is favored by Bayesian
evidence. This conclusion is robust across all four published Planck CMB
solutions. Finally, we forecast that upcoming CMB observations by Simons
Observatory, LiteBIRD and a wishful CMB-Stage 4 experiment could reduce current
uncertainties by a factor of approximately 7.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13465v1" target="_blank"><h2>Equation of state during (p)reheating with trilinear interactions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Stefan Antusch, Kenneth Marschall, Francisco Torrenti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages + references, 20 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We characterize the post-inflationary evolution of the equation of state of
the universe from the end of inflation until the onset of radiation domination,
when the inflaton is coupled to a daughter field through a trilinear
interaction. We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the
minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in
2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the
equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling
strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes
through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and
triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\bar{w} = 0$ to a
maximum value $\bar{w} = \bar{w}_{\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later
times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density,
pushing the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of
perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann
approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which
allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables.
We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave
background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary
return of the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce
the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13518v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring Direct Detection of Massive Particles Using Wave Propagation
  from Gravitational Coupling with a Wire Under Tension</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Thomas Belvin, Peter Shawhan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the feasibility of detecting galactic orbit dark matter
passing through Earth by measuring its gravitational coupling with a wire under
tension. We do so by exploring the transverse and longitudinal waves induced on
the wire to detect a massive particle passing within $\sim 1$ m of the wire.
The particle's $r^{-2}$ interaction with the wire provides an initial momentum
which develops into a propagating wave carrying a distinctive time dependent
displacement. Most interestingly, we find that both transverse and longitudinal
waves develop with unique profiles, allowing for a full, three dimensional
reconstruction of the particle's trajectory and its mass over velocity ratio.
We find that, at interaction distances of 0.1 to 100 mm with a 90 micron
diameter copper beryllium wire, Planck scale dark matter with mass $\sim
10^{19}$ GeV/$c^2$ would create immeasurable displacements on the scale of
$10^{-24}$ to $10^{-26}$ m. In order to create displacements detectable by
modern, commercially available, displacement sensors on the nanometer scale we
require dark matter with a particle mass greater than $4 \times 10^7$ kg ($\sim
2 \times 10^{32}$ GeV/$c^2$). This is outside the upper limit of the Planck
scale by 13 orders of magnitude and would also have such a low particle flux
that a detection event would be implausible. Finally, we perform a similar
analysis for a charged wire and an elementary charged particle with their
electrostatic interaction, finding that a sufficiently slow charged particle
would produce a transverse displacement comparable to the sensitivity of
currently available sensors.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13811v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic
  oscillations and supernovae data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Peng-Ju Wu, Jing-Zhao Qi, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), SDSS (abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic
distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the
angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm
L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia
supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial
neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To
explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different
parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$;
(iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of
the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential
deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation
between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$
is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In
contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with
$-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$
level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with
$-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall
analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no
evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.</p></br></body>
