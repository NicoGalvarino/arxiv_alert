  diffuse gas in the cosmic web</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuning Zhang, Dandan Xu, Chengzhe Li, Wei Cui</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and
galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical
properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However,
the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always
include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the
target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via
different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting
theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from
intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid
of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and
estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting
galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the
intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is
gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the
diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web
structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that
permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line
emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray
band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound
to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent
galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along
the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as
measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the
emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15345v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI:

filaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of
galaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is
channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct
observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of
mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data
combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a
high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2<z<0.8. Local filaments
are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M*
$> 10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, using other nearby galaxies as tracers and a
probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm, designed to overcome
limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is
tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models and
reference lightcone simulations. We recover the expected increase in galaxy
connectivity, defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy, with
stellar mass. Interestingly, we find a persistent correlation between
connectivity and star formation in medium mass galaxies (M* $= 10^{10-11}$
$\mathrm{M}_\odot$) in the low redshift bins. These results are consistent with
the cosmic web detachment scenario, suggesting that reduced connectivity to
local filaments hinders the inflow of star-forming material. We propose galaxy
connectivity to local (small-scale) filaments as a powerful and physically
motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic
structure in galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14482v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$α$
  Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Eli Visbal, Greg L. Bryan, Zoltan Haiman</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 6 figures, submitted to JCAP</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$
absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical
signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body
simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict
the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA
predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects
such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment
(all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo
clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their
carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly
ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals
primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop
III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to
better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at
$z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons.
First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs
with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the
number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the
Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and
metal-enriched star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14870v1" target="_blank"><h2>JADES and BlackTHUNDER: rest-frame Balmer-line absorption and the local

Submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 5.077, observed
with both NIRSpec/MSA and NIRSpec/IFU by the JADES and BlackTHUNDER surveys.
The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN.
The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers
deeper insight into its nature. The H$\alpha$ line has multiple components,
including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\rm
BH}/M_\odot) = 7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$\lambda$5007 gives a galaxy
dynamical mass of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot) = 9.1$, suggesting a dynamically
overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target has two
satellites, and is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas. A spatially
detached outflow is also tentatively detected. H$\alpha$ shows strong
absorption with high equivalent width (EW), ruling out a stellar origin, and
with velocity and velocity dispersion of v = -13 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ = 120
km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $\sigma$) of temporal variability
in the EW of the H$\alpha$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed,
this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$\alpha$
absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H
observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the
same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs -
and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated,
because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the
high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a
configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc,
or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing
mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14896v1" target="_blank"><h2>Overmassive Black holes live in compact galaxies in the early Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuxuan Wu, Tao Wang, Daizhong Liu, Qinghua Tan, Luis C.

Gyr of cosmic time. Most of them have high black hole (BH) masses ($M_{\rm BH}
\sim 10^{8-10} M_{\odot}$) with an elevated BH-to-stellar mass ratio compared
to typical local galaxies, posing challenges to our understanding of the
formation of supermassive BHs and their coevolution with host galaxies. Here,
based on size measurements of [CII] 158$\mu$m emission for a statistical sample
of $z \sim 6$ quasars, we find that their host galaxies are systematically more
compact (with half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.6$ kpc) than typical
star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. Specifically, the sizes of the
most compact quasar hosts, which also tend to contain less cold gas than their
more extended counterparts, are comparable to that of massive quiescent
galaxies at $z \sim 4-5$. These findings reveal an intimate connection between
the formation of massive BHs and compactness of their host galaxies in the
early universe. These compact quasar hosts are promising progenitors of the
first population of quiescent galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14441v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas motion in the ICM of the Virgo cluster replica</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Théo Lebeau, Stefano Ettori, Jenny G. Sorce, Nabila Aghanim, Jade Paste</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A, 17 pages, 9 figures and 1 table</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Within the deep gravitational potential of galaxy clusters lies the
intracluster medium (ICM). At the first order, it is considered to be at
hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing
that the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and
provides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we
intend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a
simulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected
properties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density
functions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal
pressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the
velocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF)
from projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the
components of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along
equivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from
filaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity
field to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in
particular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated
from direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections,
comparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear
relation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard
deviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift
of X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\%$
within $R_{500}$ and $9\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion,
which is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs. Finally, we show
that the VSF might probe the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback turbulent
injection scale.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14310v1" target="_blank"><h2>A measurement of Galactic synchrotron emission using MWA drift scan
  observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Suman Chatterjee, Shouvik Sarkar, Samir Choudhuri, Khandakar Md Asif Elahi, Somnath Bharadwaj, Shiv Sethi, Akash Kumar Patwa</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for publication in PASA</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Studying the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (hereafter, DGSE) at
arc-minute angular scale is important to remove the foregrounds for the
cosmological 21-cm observations. Statistical measurements of the large-scale
DGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray
electron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \, {\rm
MHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\cal C}_{\ell})$ of the DGSE of
a region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\circ}$ to $70.3^{\circ}$
at the fixed declination $-26.7^{\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24
pointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources
above $\sim430 \, {\rm mJy}\,(3\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded
Estimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\cal C}_{\ell}$. We use the
angular multipole range $65 \le \ell \le 650$ to fit the data with a model,
${\cal C}^M_{\ell}=A\times \left(\frac{1000}{\ell}\right)^{\beta}+C$, where we
interpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\propto \ell^{-\beta})$
nature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the
residual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}$ for
six PCs centered at $\alpha=352.5^{\circ}, 353^{\circ}, 357^{\circ},
4.5^{\circ}, 4^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \beta$
and $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to
$400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find
that the value of $\beta$ is consistent at $2-\sigma$ level with the earlier
measurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14885v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-consistent population synthesis of AGN from observational
  constraints in the X-rays</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  D. Gerolymatou, S. Paltani, C. Ricci, M. Regamey</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is produced by the emission of unresolved
active galactic nuclei (AGN), thus providing key information about the
properties of the primary and reprocessed X-ray emission components of the AGN
population. Equally important, studies of individual sources provide additional
constraints on the properties of AGN, such as their luminosity and obscuration.
Until now, these constraints have not been self-consistently addressed by
intrinsically linking emission, absorption, and reflection. Here we perform
numerical simulations with the ray-tracing code, RefleX, which allows us to
self-consistently model the X-ray emission of AGN with flexible geometries for
the circumnuclear medium. Using the RefleX-simulated emission of an AGN
population, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the CXB and absorption
properties measured in the X-rays, namely the observed fraction of
$N_{\mathrm{H}}$ in bins of log($N_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the fraction of absorbed
AGN, including their redshift and luminosity evolution. We sample an intrinsic
X-ray luminosity function and construct gradually more complex physically
motivated geometrical models. We examine how well each model can match all
observational constraints using a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach. We
find that, while the simple unification model can reproduce the CXB, a
luminosity dependent dusty torus is needed to reproduce the absorption
properties. When adding an accretion disc, the model best matches all
constraints simultaneously. Our synthetic population is able to reproduce the
dependence of the covering factor on luminosity, the AGN number counts from
several surveys, and the observed correlation between reflection and
obscuration. Finally, we derive an intrinsic Compton-thick fraction of
21$\pm$7%, consistent with local observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14878v1" target="_blank"><h2>The isotropy of cosmic expansion in the early and late Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alan Junzhe Zhou, Scott Dodelson, Daniel Scolnic</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 4 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We test the isotropy of cosmic expansion by combining several probes for the
first time, constructing full-sky maps of expansion rate variation using Type
Ia supernovae, fundamental plane galaxies, and CMB temperature fluctuations. We
find no hint of anisotropy or correlation between early- and late-Universe
expansion across all systematic models. The 99% confidence upper limits on
expansion rate anisotropy are 0.39% for low-redshift supernovae, 0.95% for
high-redshift CMB, and 0.37% when combined at a 60-degree smoothing scale. A
significant anomaly in the fundamental plane residual map may reflect
systematics in the current DESI dataset, as evidenced by the absence of
cross-correlation with other tracers and its correlation with spatial density
variations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14898v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified
  Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Daneng Yang, Yi-Zhong Fan, Siyuan Hou, Yue-Lin Sming Tsai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 8 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In two-component SIDM models with inter-species interactions, mass
segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central
densities and gravothermal evolution without requiring large cross sections. We
propose a model with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between
species, that connects observations across several halo mass scales while
remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables
modest mass segregation in low-mass and typical-concentration halos, consistent
with recent dwarf galaxy clustering measurements. Using cosmological zoom-in
simulations and controlled isolated halo studies, we show that this model
produces dwarf galaxy cores that grow over time, explains the structure of dark
perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and significantly increases the
number and efficiency of small-scale lenses, consistent with the galaxy-galaxy
strong lensing excess reported in clusters. Our results establish mass
segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent and testable model
capable of simultaneously addressing multiple small-scale challenges in
structure formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15286v1" target="_blank"><h2>MICONIC: JWST/MIRI MRS reveals a fast ionized gas outflow in the central

JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28$\mu$m observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization
of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases
present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from
the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is
extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from
low IP emission lines and H$_2$ transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases
present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal
several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation
predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM.
These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles ($\sigma$~600km/s),
high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region,
velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and
enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find
evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We
compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and
radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy
to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H$_2$ lines can
be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component.
The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas.
There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H$_2$ outflow, only a weak
blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H$_2$
column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio
jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy. (Abridged)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14931v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping the Excitation Mechanisms in the LINER I Active Galactic Nucleus

candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure.
These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 10$^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$) and highly obscured (with a median A$_V$ of 2.9), caught in a
short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z$\sim$5.2. Their high SFRs (with a
median of 680 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), efficient baryon to stellar mass
conversion ($\epsilon_{\star}>$20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust
content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies
reside in overdense filaments, while the remaining four may trace new distinct
structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty
galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more
than the numerous H$_{\alpha}$ emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star
formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated
evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15060v1" target="_blank"><h2>GalaxyGenius: A Mock Galaxy Image Generator for Various Telescopes from
  Hydrodynamical Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xingchen Zhou, Hang Yang, Nan Li, Qi Xiong, Furen Deng, Xian-Min Meng, Renhao Ye, Shiyin Shen, Peng Wei, Qifan Cui, Zizhao He, Ayodeji Ibitoye, Chengliang Wei, Yuedong Fang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication by A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> To advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys, we
introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy
images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations.
The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube
generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module
extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo
from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the
following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above
information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely-used
radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED
assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an
IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal
data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes while also
incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs),
and background noise to generate desired mock observational images of galaxies.
To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, We create a series of mock images of
galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and
ground-based surveys spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength
coverages, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius
offers a flexible framework developed to generate mock galaxy images with
customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references
for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research, and they
can also act as training sets for deep learning relevant studies where real
observational data are insufficient.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15059v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic seismology: can the Gaia 'phase spiral' co-exist with a clumpy,
  turbulent interstellar medium?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Thor Tepper-García, Joss Bland-Hawthorn, Timothy R. Bedding, Christoph Federrath, Oscar Agertz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> MNRAS submitted; we welcome comments, pointers to missing, relevant references</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Gaia satellite revealed a remarkable spiral pattern ('phase spiral', PS)
in the z-Vz phase plane throughout the solar neighbourhood, where z and Vz are
the displacement and velocity of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As
demonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic
stellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance in the recent past (~0.3-3
Gyr). However, previous controlled simulations did not consider the impact of
the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is
crucial because it has been suggested that this weak signal is highly
susceptible to scattering by small-scale density fluctuations typical of the
ISM. This has motivated us to explore the formation and fate of the PS in a
high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamical simulation of an idealised Galaxy
analogue bearing a realistic ISM, which interacts impulsively with a massive
perturber. In our models, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage
vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to
drive turbulence. We find that the PS is almost non-existent if the ISM has an
excess of power on sub-kiloparsec scales compared to longer wavelengths. This
can happen in the absence of star formation and feedback when the gas is
allowed to cool. In the presence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar
feedback, the PS has a patchy spatial distribution and a high degree of
intermittency on kiloparsec scales. We anticipate that future studies of the
phase-spiral behaviour on all scales will provide crucial information on
star-gas dynamics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14510v1" target="_blank"><h2>ODIN: The LAE Lyα Luminosity Function over Cosmic Time and

Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) ideal tracers for cosmology. In addition,
because Ly$\alpha$ is a resonance line, but frequently observed at large
equivalent width, it is potentially a probe of galaxy evolution. The LAE
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) is an essential measurement for making
progress on both of these aspects. Although several studies have computed the
LAE LF, very few have delved into how the function varies with environment. The
large area and depth of the One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands
(ODIN) survey makes such measurements possible at the cosmic noon redshifts of
z~2.4, ~3.1, and ~4.5. In this initial work, we present algorithms to
rigorously compute the LAE LF and test our methods on the ~16,000 ODIN LAEs
found in the extended COSMOS field. Using these limited samples, we find slight
evidence that protocluster environments either suppress the numbers of very
faint and very bright LAEs or enhance medium-bright LAEs in comparison to the
field. We also find that the LF decreases in number density and evolves towards
a steeper faint-end slope over cosmic time from z~4.5 to z~2.4.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15090v1" target="_blank"><h2>EMUSE: Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nikhel Gupta, Zeeshan Hayder, Minh Huynh, Ray P.

designed for searching specific radio sources within the extensive datasets of
the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) survey, with potential applications
to other Big Data challenges in astronomy. Built on a multimodal approach to
radio source classification and retrieval, EMUSE fine-tunes the OpenCLIP model
on curated radio galaxy datasets. Leveraging the power of foundation models,
our work integrates visual and textual embeddings to enable efficient and
flexible searches within large radio astronomical datasets. We fine-tune
OpenCLIP using a dataset of 2,900 radio galaxies, encompassing various
morphological classes, including FR-I, FR-II, FR-x, R-type, and other rare and
peculiar sources. The model is optimized using adapter-based fine-tuning,
ensuring computational efficiency while capturing the unique characteristics of
radio sources. The fine-tuned model is then deployed in EMUSE, allowing for
seamless image- and text-based queries over the EMU survey dataset. Our results
demonstrate the model's effectiveness in retrieving and classifying radio
sources, particularly in recognizing distinct morphological features. However,
challenges remain in identifying rare or previously unseen radio sources,
highlighting the need for expanded datasets and continuous refinement. This
study showcases the potential of multimodal machine learning in radio
astronomy, paving the way for more scalable and accurate search tools in the
field. The search engine is accessible at https://askap-emuse.streamlit.app/

  Observations: Tracing Organic Refractories and Beyond</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Prathap Rayalacheruvu, Liton Majumdar, W. R. M. Rocha, Michael E. Ressler, Pabitra Ranjan Giri, S. Maitrey, K. Willacy, D. C. Lis, Y. Chen, P. D. Klaassen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series (ApJS). 40 pages, 24 figures, 7 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral
resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices,
including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs).
However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features
particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We
present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval
Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate
removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS),
and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to
NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars
(JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical
depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption
using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our
results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and
COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features
from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories
contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various
ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral
fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are
likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl
(O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now
incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical
evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of
global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.</p></br></body>
