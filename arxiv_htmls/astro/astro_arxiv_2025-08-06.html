  Stripe82 II: Spectroscopic Diversity and Broad H$α$ Emissions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ben Wang, Yuzo Ishikawa, Joseph F. Hennawi, Zheng Cai, Gordon T. Richards, Nadia L.

mid-infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at redshifts z = 0.88 to 3.49. The targets
were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4
detections (flux > 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts
(e.g., r > 23 or r - W4 > 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars.
Deep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy
confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range,
including 12 objects at z > 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and
optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of
line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third
of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM > 2000 km/s) despite
their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM < 2000
km/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line
Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the
JWST-discovered "little red dot" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could
be lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered
by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively
weak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in
lower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built
using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection
efficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that
spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study
provides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and
bridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02940v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Diversity of Metal-Enrichment and Abundance Patterns at High

the metal enrichment in concentrated reservoirs of hydrogen, such as the damped
Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in the early universe. We conducted a survey aimed
at discovering DLAs along sight lines to high-z quasars in order to measure
element abundances at z>4. Here we report our first results from this survey
for 10 DLAs with redshifts of ~4.2-5.0. We determine abundances of C, O, Si, S,
and Fe, and thereby the metallicities and dust depletions. We find that DLA
metallicities at z>4.5 show a wide diversity spanning ~3 orders of magnitude.
The metallicities of DLAs at 3.7<z<5.3 show a larger dispersion compared to
that at lower redshifts. Combining our sample with the literature, we find a
relatively smooth evolution of metallicity with redshift out to z~5.3, with a
tentative (~2 sigma) indication of a slight rise in metallicity at 4.5<z<5.3.
The relative abundances exhibit C enhancement for both metal-poor and
metal-enriched DLAs. In addition, alpha-element enhancement is evident in some
DLAs, including a DLA at z=4.7 with a super-solar metallicity. Comparing [C/O]
and [Si/O] with model predictions, 4 DLAs in our survey seem consistent with a
non-zero Pop III contribution (3 with >=30% Pop-III contribution). Combining
our sample and the literature, we find the dust depletion strength and
dust-to-metal ratios to correlate positively with the total (gas+solid phase)
metallicity, confirming the presence of metal-rich, dusty DLAs even at ~1
billion years after the Big Bang.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03536v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray Halos of Early-Type Galaxies with AGN Feedback and Accretion from

galaxies has significantly advanced in the past years, for large and
homogeneously investigated samples. We compare these results with the X-ray
properties of an exploratory set of gas evolution models in realistic
early-type galaxies, produced with our high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical code
MACER that includes AGN feedback and accretion from a circumgalactic medium.
The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight,
to obtain maps of the surface brightness Sigma_X and temperature Tx. The X-ray
diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole
galaxy (Lx and <Tx>) and within 5 optical effective radii (Lx5 and <Tx5>), and
the circularized profiles Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R). The values for Lx, Lx5, <Tx>,
and <Tx5> compare very well with those observed. The Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) also
present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy
NGC5129, and of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for Tx(R):
Sigma_X(R) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii Re,
and Tx(R) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R=(1 - 3)Re. Inside
the peak position, Tx(R) declines towards the center, but the explored models
are systematically hotter by ~30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy
are discussed. Interestingly, Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) as large as observed outside
of R~Re are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic
medium, highlighting its importance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02779v1" target="_blank"><h2>EUCLID: Photometric redshift calibration with self-organising maps</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  W.

redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining
highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all
tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints.
However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases
arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid
Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of
$|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle
\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that
defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift
(spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins
satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the
photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of
ten bins [$0 < z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the
realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey
in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet
the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography
defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used
mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for
$\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we
perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift
uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty
where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases
remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the
more realistic case.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03569v1" target="_blank"><h2>Renzo's rule revisited: A statistical study of galaxies' baryon - dark

phenomenon known as Renzo's rule (or Sancisi's law), which states that "for any
feature in a galaxy's luminosity profile, there is a corresponding feature in
the rotation curve, and vice versa." This is often posed as a challenge for the
standard LCDM model while supporting alternative theories such as MOND. Indeed,
we identify clear features in the dwarf spiral NGC 1560 -- a prime example for
Renzo's rule -- and find correlation statistics which support Renzo's rule with
a slight preference for MOND over LCDM halo fits. However, a broader analysis
on galaxies in the SPARC database reveals an excess of features in rotation
curves that lack clear baryonic counterparts, with correlation statistics
deviating up to $3\sigma$ on average from that predicted by both MOND and LCDM
haloes, challenging the validity of Renzo's rule. Thus we do not find clear
evidence for Renzo's rule in present galaxy data overall. We additionally
perform mock tests, which show that a definitive test of Renzo's rule is
primarily limited by the lack of clearly resolved baryonic features in current
galaxy data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02837v1" target="_blank"><h2>Memoirs of mass accretion: probing the edges of intracluster light in

intracluster light (ICL), has the potential to be read as a memoir of mass
accretion: informative, individual, and yet imperfect. Here, we combine dark
matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus
"star-tagging" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about
the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized
measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar
profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar "splashback" radii
-- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete
merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We
find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time
ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser
degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters
that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time.
We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the
MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive
to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo
concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer
of relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL
features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby
clusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the
groundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03462v1" target="_blank"><h2>High Frequency Peak Radio Sources from the AT20G Catalogue and Their

the sources in the sample, which included 269 radio sources, was performed. The
spectra of the sources were constructed and the spectral indices below
$\alpha_{below}$ and above the peak $\alpha_{above}$, the peak frequency
$\nu_{obs}$, the flux density at the peak frequency $S_{peak}$, and the peak
half-width in the radio spectrum were determined. Analysis of the spectra
showed that the sample is fairly homogeneous and consists of HFPs with
$\nu_{obs}>5$ GHz. Most sources (67%) do not have data at frequencies below 0.8
GHz. 187 sources have ultra-inverted spectra ($\alpha_{below}>$+0.7), which is
3.2% of all sources in the AT20G catalog and 70% of radio sources in our

(Ly$\alpha$F) datasets, summary statistics, e.g. the power spectrum, are
commonly used. However, such summaries unavoidably lose some information,
weakening the constraining power on parameters of interest. Recently, machine
learning (ML)-based summary approaches have been proposed as an alternative to
human-defined statistical measures. This raises a question: can ML-based
summaries contain the full information captured by traditional statistics, and
vice versa? In this study, we apply three human-defined techniques and one
ML-based approach to summarize mock Ly$\alpha$F data from hydrodynamical
simulations and infer two thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium,
assuming a power-law temperature-density relation. We introduce a metric for
measuring the improvement in the figure of merit when combining two summaries.
Consequently, we demonstrate that the ML-based summary approach not only
contains almost all of the information from the human-defined statistics, but
also that it provides significantly stronger constraints by a ratio of better
than 1:3 in terms of the posterior volume on the temperature-density relation
parameters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03015v1" target="_blank"><h2>Re-examination of the CO absorption line in the M87 nucleus</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Norita Kawanaka, Hiroshi Nagai, Yutaka Fujita</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), molecular gas (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyzed the archival ALMA data of the nuclear region of M87 and evaluate

compact cores from 1.3 mm continuum emission using getsf. Observed linear core
separations ($\lambda_{\rm obs}$) are significantly less than the thermal Jeans
length ($\lambda_{\rm J}$), with the $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}$ ratios
peaking at $\sim0.2$. This indicates that thermal Jeans fragmentation has taken
place within the IR-bright protocluster clumps studied here. The observed low
ratio of $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}\ll 1$ could be the result of
evolving core separation or hierarchical fragmentation. Based on associated
signatures of star formation (e.g., outflows and ionized gas), we classified
cores into three categories: 127 starless, 971 warm, and 464 evolved cores. Two
starless cores have mass exceeding 16$\,M_{\odot}$, and represent high-mass

nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production.
BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial
locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs)
transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by
explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under
different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to
Type II migration. We quantify where and when binaries form as a function of
supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find
that while the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps, a
substantial fraction takes place elsewhere in the disk, particularly for
high-viscosity disks ($\alpha=0.1-0.4$) and SMBHs with mass above a threshold
of $10^{7.5}$ solar masses, where differential migration is most efficient. The
inclusion of thermal torques favors pair-up in outer locations of the disk and
facilitates rapid pair-up. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation,
showing that higher-generation pair-ups are more tightly clustered around trap
locations. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up
locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH
formation sites.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02776v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigation of mass substructure in gravitational lens system SDP.81

crucial test for understanding the nature of dark matter, and may be
constrained through the gravitational deflection of strongly lensed arcs.
Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes
in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy
SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this
work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported
results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular
structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law
density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo
detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have
found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\approx 10^{9}\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real
data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo
inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth
model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence
in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the
lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes,
consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass
haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles
up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite.
Overall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality
to simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular
structure.</p></br></body>
