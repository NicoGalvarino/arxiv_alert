We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11790v1" target="_blank"><h2>GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20?

Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$α$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1σ$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11744v1" target="_blank"><h2>The low-mass and structured stellar halo of M83 argues against a merger origin for its starburst and extended neutral hydrogen disk</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eric F.

We observe M83's stellar halo to test this idea. We train nearest-neighbor star-galaxy separation on wide-area Subaru imaging with Hubble Space Telescope data to map M83's halo in resolved stars. We find that M83 has an extended, very low density smooth stellar halo of old and metal-poor [M/H]$\sim -1.15$ RGB stars with a mass between 15 and 40 kpc of $\log_{10}M_{*,15-40,maj}/M_{\odot}=8.02\pm0.10$. In addition to M83's well-known Northern Stream, our ground-based Subaru imaging reveals a new stream to M83's south, which modeling suggests could be its trailing arm. The combined stream masses are $\log_{10}M_{stream}/M_{\odot}=7.93\pm0.10$, with metallicity [M/H]$= -1.0\pm0.2$. The stream progenitor was only recently accreted, as its stellar populations suggest that it formed stars until $2.1\pm1.3$ Gyr ago. M83 lies on the stellar halo mass-metallicity correlation seen for other Milky Way mass galaxies, albeit with low stellar halo mass. We infer a total accreted mass of $\log_{10}M_{*,accreted}/M_{\odot}=8.78^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$, with the most massive past merger having $\log_{10}M_{*,dom}/M_{\odot}=8.5\pm0.3$. We identify plausible M83 analogs in TNG-50 with similar stellar halos, finding that while a recent accretion can create a prominent stellar stream, such accretions do not trigger starburst activity, nor do they deliver enough gas to form M83's extended Hi disk. We conclude that other non-merger mechanisms, such as secular evolution or accretion of gas from the IGM, are likely to be responsible for M83's remarkable properties.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11710v1" target="_blank"><h2>Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): on the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra I cluster.

The sample consists of low-surface brightness (LSB) and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) located inside 0.4 R$_{vir}$ of the Hydra I cluster. Integral field spectroscopy is acquired for 24 galaxies with the MUSE spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Aims: Our main objective is to analyse possible correlations between the environment and the integrated stellar population properties. Methods: For each galaxy, we extract the 1D stacked spectrum in an aperture of one effective radius and adopt previously published stellar kinematics to derive age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] through a full spectral fitting technique. Results: We find that the analysed LEWIS sample has a mean metallicity of [M/H] = -0.9 dex, a mean age of 10 Gyr, comparable to results of UDGs in other clusters. According to the projected phase-space, galaxies can be classified into two groups: early infallers, with slightly higher metallicities ([M/H]$_{early} = -0.8 \pm 0.1$ dex), and late infallers, with slightly lower values ([M/H]$_{late} = -1.0 \pm 0.1$ dex). Two types of galaxies are found in the early-infall region: half of them have metallicities consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation, while the other half show higher values. Moreover, they display different timescales for stellar mass assembly. Conclusions: We identified different classes of UDGs in the Hydra I cluster, which suggest different formation mechanisms taking place. Almost all of the UDGs and LSBs in the cluster are consistent with the puffed-up dwarf formation scenario, having dwarf-like metallicities and being consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation. In the innermost regions of the cluster, where metal-richer UDGs lie, tidal or environmental effects might have influenced their formation and evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11700v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Domain Adaptation problem in photometric redshift estimation: a solution applied to the HSC Survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i<25 (z<~5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts. The catalogs of CNN redshifts we inferred for the XMM, DEEP2 and ELAIS fields and for the remaining COSMOS region (~4 million sources in total at i<25) are made public.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11694v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Spatially Resolved Evolutionary Sequence of Multi-wavelength AGN Host Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gaoxiang Jin, Guinevere Kauffmann, Y.

We also provide estimations of AGN power at different wavelengths. AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs. Compared to their mass-matched non-AGN counterparts, we find that IRAGNs, BLAGNs, and NLAGNs on average show enhanced specific star formation rates, younger stellar populations, and harder ionisation towards the centre. RDAGNs, in contrast, show radial profiles similar to quiescent galaxies. [OIII] outflows are more common and stronger in BL/IRAGNs, while RDAGNs on average show no outflow features. The outflow incidence increases with [OIII] luminosity, and the features in BL/IRAGNs on average extend to ~2 kpc from the nuclei. We further discuss a possible evolutionary sequence of AGNs and their host galaxies, where AGNs with strong emission lines or dust tori are present in star-forming galaxies. Later, young compact radio jets emerge, the host galaxies gradually quench, and the AGN hosts eventually evolve into globally quiescent systems with larger radio jets that prevent further gas cooling.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11678v1" target="_blank"><h2>One-loop power spectrum corrections in interacting dark energy cosmologies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Emanuelly Silva, Gabriel Hartmann, Rafael C.

Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = ξ\mathcal{H} ρ_{\rm m}$ and $Q = ξ\mathcal{H} ρ_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = Γ\, ρ_{\rm m} \, ρ_{\rm DE} \, θ_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $Γ$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $Γ$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $Γ= 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $Λ$CDM framework.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11665v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rapid sinking and efficient mergers of supermassive black holes in compact high-redshift galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Atte Keitaanranta, Peter H.

The dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is modelled from seeding down to their coalescence at sub-parsec scales due to gravitational wave (GW) emission by utilising a new version of the KETJU code, which combines regularised integration of sufficiently massive SMBHs with a dynamical friction subgrid model for lower-mass SMBHs. All nine massive galaxies included in this study go through a gas-dominated phase of early compaction in the redshift range of $z\sim 7-9$, starting at stellar masses of $M_\star\gtrsim 10^8\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and ending at a few times $M_{\star}\sim 10^9\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. The sizes, masses and broad band fluxes of these compact systems are in general agreement with the population of systems observed with JWST known as `Little Red Dots'. In the compact phase, the stellar and SMBH masses grow rapidly, leading to a sharp decline in the central gas fractions. The outer regions, however, remain relatively gas-rich, leading to subsequent off-centre star formation and size growth. Due to the very high central stellar densities ($ρ_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot/kpc^3}$), the SMBHs merge rapidly, typically just $\sim 4-35\ \mathrm{Myr}$ after the SMBH binaries have become bound. Combining KETJU with the phenomenological PhenomD model resolves the complete evolution of the GW emission from SMBH binaries through the Pulsar Timing Array frequency waveband up to the final few orbits that produce GWs observable with the future LISA mission.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11656v1" target="_blank"><h2>The multiphase interstellar medium as a common origin for magnetic misalignment and TB parity violation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrea Bracco, Ari J.

We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\geq 10^\circ$, multipoles $\ell \leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere.
  We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation.
  The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements. The model introduced here suggests a new interpretation of two unexplained observables and emphasizes the role of the large-scale magnetized ISM in shaping polarized Galactic emission, which has important implications for both Galactic astrophysics and cosmological foreground characterization.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11639v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark sector interactions in the $w \rightarrow -1$ limit: velocity locking in pure momentum exchange models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nathan Cruickshank, Robert Crittenden, Kazuya Koyama, Marco Bruni<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 9 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Models of interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) involving pure momentum exchange are a promising avenue for resolving cosmological tensions. However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($δ_{\mathrm{DE}}=θ_{\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales. This leads to an overestimation of the constraining power of cosmological data on the interaction strength.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11572v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST and HST observations of the host galaxy and supernova, SN 2024aihh in EP240801a at z=1.67</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Agnes P.

Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11568v1" target="_blank"><h2>The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $Λ$CDM</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> H.

Here, we report its gas-phase rotational spectrum, measured using two complementary techniques: chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy (2$-$18 GHz) and free-jet millimeter-wave (FJ$-$AMMW) absorption spectroscopy (59.6$-$80 GHz).

A stringent upper limit to its column density was derived ($N<$ 4 $\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$), corresponding to a molecular abundance of $<$ 2.9 $\times$10$^{-11}$ relative to H$_{2}$. This upper limit lies well below the observed abundances of simpler structurally related species containing $-$HCO and $-$CN groups, underscoring the challenge of detecting increasingly complex prebiotic molecules in the ISM and the need for future, more sensitive astronomical facilities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11488v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Polarized X-ray Universe: Insights and Discoveries</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Arbind Pradhan, Sree Bhattacherjee, Biplob Sarkar<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 0 figure, The manuscript will appear as a book chapter in the forthcoming book entitled "Advances in Physical Sciences: Theories, Applications, and Innovations<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation.

Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11409v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Influential Roles of Gravity, Turbulence, and Magnetic Fields in Shaping the Physical Evolution of Dense Massive Clumps</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Moses Onyemaechi Asogwa, Seblu Humne Negu, Gemechu Muleta Kumssa, Innocent Okwudili Eya<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (RAA).

By examining scaling relations, virial parameters, and turbulent energy spectra, we evaluate the dynamical state of these clumps. We observe a weak velocity dispersion-size relation (sigma proportional to L^0.11), which is much shallower than the classical Larson-like relations, suggesting that turbulence does not mainly drive internal dynamics. The turbulent energy spectrum, E(k) proportional to k^-1.21, is also less steep than what is expected for both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We equally observe a decreasing trend in the virial parameter with increasing mass (alpha_vir proportional to M^-0.37), indicating that more massive clumps are increasingly gravitationally bound. These trends indicate an increasing relative dominance of gravity over turbulence at smaller scales, aligning with multiscale collapse scenarios; however, the absolute energy balance remains unquantifiable with the current data. Although magnetic fields are not directly measured, their potential influence is considered in the interpretation of pressure balance and dynamical support. Our findings imply that gravitational processes appear to primarily regulate the structure and evolution of massive clumps.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11397v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intergalactic magnetic field lower limits up to the redshift $z\approx3$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ievgen Vovk<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages (inc. references), 9 figures, submitted to the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $γ$-ray "echo" from sources at cosmological distances. While these contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $γ$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $γ$-ray "echo", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 9σ$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $γ$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11383v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observational evidence of tidal torque in the primordial Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ming-Jie Sheng, Hao-Ran Yu, Min Bao, Bing-Hang Chen, Fang-Na Shao, Qi Guo, Yanmei Chen, Huiyuan Wang, Ue-Li Pen, Jie Wang, Xiaohu Yang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 4 figures, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> cosmic evolution (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy angular momenta are imprinted by the early tidal field acting on their proto-structures, which are preserved through cosmic evolution and provide the potentially most precise measurement of the early universe.

By comparing the observed gas angular momentum vectors with those predicted from the primordial density field reconstructed by ELUCID for the nearby universe, we conclusively detect a strong direction correlation with a significance of about $7σ$.

Although improved theoretical models exist for anisotropic clustering, their applicability is limited by the non-perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of relative velocities. Here, we consider an alternative approach using the statistical power of cross-correlation between galaxy clustering and 21-cm line intensity mapping. Based on Fisher matrix analysis, fully incorporating nonlinear RSD, we estimate the benefit of combining both observables. We find that, for spectroscopy surveys like DESI combined with 21-cm line-intensity mapping surveys, the constraint on the growth of structure is improved by a factor of two relative to the galaxy auto-correlation, while the constraint on the cosmic expansion is only slightly improved. Crucially, such an observation can strongly constrain the neutral hydrogen (HI) content Omega_HI to a sub-percent level. This level of precision unlocks the potential of this method to probe post-reionization astrophysics with enhanced precision. It would far surpass existing constraints from stacked 21-cm emission (resulting in ~ 50%-100% uncertainties) and break the degeneracy between Omega_HI and the HI bias b_HI inherent in linear-regime power spectrum analysis. This cross-correlation approach effectively compensates for the loss of constraining power when using galaxy clustering alone.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11309v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of galaxies over 13 billion years in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Claudia del P.

These simulations feature on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to dust grain evolution and detailed radiative cooling down to $\approx 10$~K, enabling direct predictions for the atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_2$) KS relations. At $z\approx 0$, COLIBRE reproduces the observed (spatially-resolved) KS relations for HI and H$_2$, including the associated scatter, which we predict to be significantly correlated with stellar surface density, local specific SFR (sSFR), and gas metallicity. We show that the HI KS relation steepens for lower-mass galaxies, while the H$_2$ KS relation shifts to higher normalisation in galaxies with higher sSFRs. The H$_2$ depletion time decreases by a factor of $\approx 20$ from $z = 0$ to $z = 8$, primarily due to the decreasing gas-phase metallicity. This results in less H$_2$ and more HI being associated with a given SFR at higher redshift. We also find that galaxies with higher sSFRs have a larger molecular gas content and higher star formation efficiency per unit gas mass on kpc scales. The predicted evolution of the H$_2$ depletion time and its correlation with a galaxy's sSFR agree remarkably well with observations in a wide redshift range, $0\le z\le 5$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11207v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synthetic polarization observations of magnetized pillars in HII regions: The limitations of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Luis Andrés Hernández-Cruz, Manuel Zamora-Avilés, Abraham Luna, Raúl Naranjo-Romero, José Franco, Aina Palau, Alejandro García-Pérez, Javier Ballesteros-Paredes<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigated the morphology and strength of magnetic fields in pillar-shaped structures at the boundaries of HII regions by combining three-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic, R-MHD, simulations with synthetic polarimetric observations. Our analysis focuses on the first pillar formed self-consistently in the simulation and is used as a proof of concept to test the applicability of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method under conditions dominated by external agents. The pillar arises as the ionization front compresses a dense clump, producing a magnetically aligned, elongated structure whose morphology and field configuration closely resemble those observed in real systems such as the pillars of M16. Synthetic dust-polarization maps at 850 $μ$m reproduce the large-scale magnetic morphology of the simulated pillar, confirming that polarimetry is a reliable tracer of magnetic field geometry. However, magnetic field strengths inferred using DCF-type methods systematically overestimate intrinsic values from the simulations by factors $\gtrsim 2$. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that field alignment and amplification are primarily driven by external gas pressure from the expanding HII region rather than internal turbulence, thus violating key assumptions of the DCF method. Our results highlight the need for caution when applying classical DCF-based analysis to pillars or other structures shaped by external compressions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11175v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Interplay of Stellar Evolution and Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jaden S.

In these environments, collisions can shape the stellar mass function and produce exotic stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how stellar collisions couple with stellar evolution in the inner parsec of an NSC. We simulate the evolution of a sample of $1000$ $1$ $M_\odot$ stars embedded in a uniform cluster of dynamically relaxed 0.5 $M_\odot$ stars. Using COSMIC to evolve stellar properties in time , we track the mass, radius, and evolutionary state of the stars as they collide in the cluster. Our results show that most stars within $0.1$~pc of the SMBH experience a collision while on the main-sequence. However, outside of this distance, stars collide during the red giant phase, when the stellar radius increases dramatically. We find that the most common type of collision -- main-sequence or red giant -- over the lifetime of the cluster depends on the steepness of the stellar cusp, which determines the spatial distribution of the stars in the cluster. These results show that stellar evolution plays a fundamental role in shaping the collisional history of stars in nuclear star clusters. Lastly, we consider whether the closest known stars to the Milky Way's SMBH have experienced a collision. We estimate that several of the S-stars have a high probability of experiencing a collision over their main-sequence lifetime, perhaps with implications for their observed youth and properties.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11163v1" target="_blank"><h2>Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Christopher Cook, Joel Meyers<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> baryon density (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11128v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lea Burmeister, Paolo Da vela, Francesco Longo, Guillem Marti-Devesa, Manuel Meyer, Francesco Saturni, Antonio Stamerra, Peter Veres<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under review in PRL. 14 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc.

Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties.

Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5.

A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}β$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}β>3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A_V\gtrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}β$ and $\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}γ$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\sim O(10~M_\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11042v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIRACLE III.

MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20--60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e > 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11039v1" target="_blank"><h2>KiDS-Legacy: Constraints on Horndeski gravity from weak lensing combined with galaxy clustering and cosmic microwave background anisotropies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Benjamin Stölzner, Robert Reischke, Matteo Grasso, Matteo Cataneo, Benjamin Joachimi, Arthur Loureiro, Alessio Spurio Mancini, Angus H.

Cosmic shear constrains the Horndeski parameter space significantly, matching or surpassing the CMB contribution. Adopting the de-mixed kinetic term of the scalar field perturbation, $D_{\rm kin}$, and the deviation of the Planck mass from its fiducial value, $ΔM_*^2\equiv M_*^2-1$, as model parameters, we constrain their present values to be $Δ\hat{M}_*^2=0.32^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$ and $\hat{D}_{\rm kin} = 3.74^{+0.69}_{-1.92}$, which deviate from general relativity at $1.5σ$ and $1.9σ$, respectively.

We examine how these stellar and BH populations influence the dynamics of the IMBH binary and, in turn, how the evolving IMBH binary affects the surrounding stellar and BH populations. We conduct high-resolution $N$-body simulations of NSCs constructed based on observational parameters from two local dwarf galaxies: NGC205 and NGC404. For the first time, we achieve a star particle mass resolution of $1\rm\;M_{\odot}$ and a BH mass resolution of $10\rm\;M_{\odot}$. This level of resolution is crucial for accurately modeling the collisional dynamics of these dense systems. Including stellar-mass BHs within the stellar population significantly influences the IMBH binary dynamics, nearly doubling the sinking rate and halving the merger time. During the initial phase of the inspiral, the IMBH binary disrupts both the stellar and BH cusps. However, the BH cusp quickly regains its steep slope due to its shorter relaxation time and continues to dominate the evolution of the IMBH binary, despite being much less massive compared to the stellar component. We uncover an interesting mechanism in which BHs first efficiently extract energy from the IMBH binary and then transfer this energy to the surrounding stars, allowing the BHs to spiral back toward the center of the system and restart the process. Our results imply that, although stellar mass BHs are a minor component of a stellar population, they can significantly facilitate IMBH growth within NSCs via mergers. We also notice that these dense systems can potentially boost Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) predominantly on radial orbits.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11035v1" target="_blank"><h2>The abundance of thin dwarf galaxies: a challenge for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> José A.

We use the distribution of projected axis ratios, $q$, to infer the abundance of intrinsically flat galaxies needed to reproduce the observed abundance of highly elongated systems in projection. We find that as many as $40\%$ of galaxies in the mass range $10^9 < M_{\star}/\rm{M_\odot} < 10^{10}$ are intrinsically flatter than $1$:$5$ (i.e., $c/a < 0.2$), a fraction that rises to $\sim 80\%$ for $c/a < 0.3$. Although the incidence of thin galaxies decreases towards lower and higher $M_{\star}$, they are still quite common in dwarfs: $\sim 30\%$ and $\sim 65\%$ of $\sim 10^8 ~ \rm{M_\odot}$ galaxies are inferred to be intrinsically flatter than $c/a=0.2$ and $0.3$, respectively. A comparison of these results with several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (TNG50, FIREbox, Romulus25) reveals a distinctive lack of thin simulated dwarfs. In particular, there are no $M_{\star} < 10^9 ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ simulated galaxies flatter than $c/a=0.2$, in clear contrast with observational samples. This discrepancy likely reflects limitations in resolution and in the treatment of baryonic physics, suggesting that our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the formation of disk galaxies less massive than the Milky Way is still quite incomplete. Our results present a clear challenge to current numerical models of dwarf galaxy formation, which future models should attempt to meet.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11033v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical disequilibrium in dwarf galaxies: rethinking gas dynamics, rotation curves, and dark matter inference</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Diego Dado, Kyle A.

We evaluate the full Eulerian acceleration balance in the midplane and show that disequilibrium is widespread: equilibrium-based circular velocity estimates typically have errors of $\geq 10$ per cent ($\approx 75$ per cent of midplane gas by mass). Disequilibrium is strongest and the largest associated errors occur in the inner few kiloparsecs that are crucial for constraining the dark matter density profile. Correcting the circular velocity to account for pressure and convective terms does not reliably improve its recovery in strongly perturbed systems where time-dependent forces dominate the residual acceleration budget. Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium. We classify gas discs into coherent, perturbed, and slow/erratic rotators and show that this classification correlates with galaxy properties like mass, morphology and tracers of recent feedback. A majority of galaxies in our sample would be unsuitable for standard rotation curve analysis. Much of the observed diversity in the shapes of dwarf galaxy rotation curves may stem from non-equilibrium gas motions rather than diversity in mass profiles - resolving the discrepancy is then first and foremost a problem in gas dynamics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11028v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical composition and enrichment of the Centaurus cluster core seen by XRISM/Resolve</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

This makes the intracluster medium (ICM) an ideal astrophysical system to constrain its chemical composition, hence ultimately understand metal production and enrichment on megaparsec scales. In this work, we take advantage of the unprecedented ~5 eV resolution offered by XRISM/Resolve to measure the chemical composition of the core of the bright, nearby, and metal-rich Centaurus cluster (287 ks) with unprecedented accuracy. We use these measurements to provide constraints on the stellar populations having enriched the cluster core. We derived the Fe abundance and its relative Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. We completed this high-resolution view with N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained with XMM-Newton/RGS archival data. Similarly to the core of Perseus, we find that nine out of our 11 measured abundance ratios are formally consistent with the chemical composition of our Solar System. However, the (super-solar) N/Fe and (half-solar) Mg/Fe ratios significantly differ from Perseus and/or other systems, thus provide tension with the picture of a fully solar composition ubiquitous to all systems. In addition, possible uncertainties in O/Fe and Ne/Fe with atomic codes highlight the need for studying more systems at high spectral resolution to assess (or rule out) the universality of the ICM composition in clusters' cool cores. Combinations of (AGB+)SNcc+SNIa yield models can reproduce our observed X/Fe ratios in all cases. However, whether two distinct populations of SNIa are needed depends on the weight of our RGS measurements. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a multi-metallicity gas phase in this respect.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11022v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Active Galaxy Cluster Merger at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST Weak Lensing and Multiwavelength Probes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zachary P.

Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain mass and concentration estimates of $M_{200\rm c}=1.6 \pm 0.3\times 10^{14}~M_{\odot}$ and $c_{200 \rm c}=6.3 \pm 0.3$, respectively, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates.

These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10924v1" target="_blank"><h2>Signatures of star formation inside galactic outflows <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dily Duan Yi Ong, Francesco D'Eugenio, Roberto Maiolino, Santiago Arribas, Francesco Belfiore, Enrica Bellocchi, Stefano Carniani, Sara Cazzoli, Giovanni Cresci, Andrew Fabian, Wako Ishibashi, Filippo Mannucci, Alessandro Marconi, Helen Russell, Eckhard Sturm, Giacomo Venturi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title, abstract), outflow (title, abstract), molecular gas (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations have suggested that galactic outflows contain substantial amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, creating favourable conditions for igniting star formation. Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10917v1" target="_blank"><h2>Heterogeneous Cosmological Phase Transitions: Seeded by Domain Walls and Junctions <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yang Bai, Yifu Xu, Yiming Yang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 33 pages, 10 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), LLS (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Heterogeneous nucleation is central to many familiar first-order phase transitions such as the freezing of water and the solidification of metals, and it can also play a crucial role in cosmology. We examine nucleation seeded by preexisting domain walls and demonstrate its strong impact on the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions. The bubble solutions take the form of spherical caps, and the contact angle is fixed by the ratio of the domain-wall tension to the bubble-wall tension. A larger domain-wall tension, or equivalently a smaller contact angle, reduces the wall-seeded bubble volume and lowers the critical nucleation action. For theories with $\mathbb{Z}_{n\geq 3}$ symmetry, domain-wall junctions naturally appear and we find that they seed nucleation even more efficiently than the walls themselves. Using a two-scalar-field model as an illustration, we compute nucleation temperatures for both homogeneous and heterogeneous channels and show that junction-seeded nucleation occurs at a higher temperature and is the dominant mechanism that completes the first-order cosmological phase transition.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10893v1" target="_blank"><h2>The LISA Astrophysics "Disc-IMRI" Code Comparison Project: Intermediate-Mass-Ratio Binaries in AGN-Like Discs <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrea Derdzinski, Alexander J.

These binaries are comprised of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass object or intermediate-mass black hole. Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque. With time and energy efficiency in mind, codes that leverage moving meshes or grid-based Lagrangian remapping seem preferable, as do codes that can leverage graphical processing units and other energy-efficient hardware.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10883v1" target="_blank"><h2>Weighing the Milky Way's Satellite Galaxies Using Pulsar Accelerations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Thomas Donlon, Sukanya Chakrabarti, Jason A.

Recent efforts to measure the masses of the MW's satellite dwarf galaxies have relied on the motions and positions of stars in the MW's disk and halo, which are perturbed by the passage of satellite galaxies. As there are many known processes in our Galaxy that lead to observed disequilibrium in stars, these kinematic methods have been limited by the inherent difficulty in identifying only the perturbations due to particular satellite galaxies. We present a novel method for determining the masses of two MW satellite galaxies -- the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) -- using only direct, instantaneous acceleration data derived from extremely precise timing of millisecond pulsars near the Sun. As the LMC and Sgr dSph orbit the MW, they cause wave-like distortions in the structure of the disk plus a large-scale offset in the centers of mass of the dark matter halo and the baryonic disk. These two effects lead to asymmetric accelerations above and below the disk midplane near the Sun, which is observed in the pulsar acceleration data. Notably, the amplitude of this asymmetry is shown to depend on the masses of the orbiting satellites. We analyze a grid of simulations with varying masses of each satellite. We find the total (dark + baryon) mass enclosed within the tidal radius at the present day for the LMC to be 4.1 $\pm$ 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ within a radius of 16.6 kpc, and for Sgr to be 3.5 $\pm$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ within a radius of 5 kpc. These results are generally consistent and competitive with previous determinations of the masses of these objects, but entirely independent of any stellar kinematic data for the first time.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10839v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving the ionizing photon budget crisis with JWST/NIRCam HII clumping constraints at z=6 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Duncan Austin, Thomas Harvey, Christopher J.

Our $90\%$ stellar mass complete sample suggests little relation of UV slope with magnitude, $β_{\rm UV}=(-0.040\pm0.022)M_{\rm UV}-2.88^{+0.43}_{-0.44}$, implying $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}\simeq5\%$ based on calibrations from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS).

We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\rm h} = (2.78 \pm 0.05)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\sim18$months with monthly cadence.

The pressure is the weight of the disk inside the gas layer, including gas, stars, and dark matter, which usually dominates disk gravity in dIrrs. We compare the results to the outer part of M33, which has similar local properties but a slightly higher metallicity, enabling the detection of CO. All the data are convolved to the HI beam, but to study the effects of resolution, the galaxies are examined first with average radial profiles, and then with maps having 1.5" pixels and 244 pc pixels. The correlations are found to be independent of resolution from 24 pc to 424 pc. The average ratio of molecular to atomic surface density is estimated to be 0.23+-0.1, from the H_2 surface density in M33 compared to the HI surface density at the same Sigma_SFR in the dIrrs. With this ratio, the average star formation rate per molecule is about the same for all the dIrrs, and a factor of 2 less than the rate in M33. The pressure in dIrrs is so low that CO is essentially a dense gas tracer, with the same surface density threshold at the low metallicities of dIrrs as HCN has in spiral galaxies. As a result, CO regions in dIrrs should be strongly self-gravitating.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10769v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical enrichment in LINERs from MaNGA. II.

Whereas in the last decades there has been an increase in the number of galaxies studied with integral field spectroscopy, there is still not a clear picture on a subsequent characterization of the chemical abundance radial gradients in galaxies hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This lack of analysis is even more accentuated in the case of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). For the first time, we analyze the chemical abundance radial gradients in a sample of LINER-like galaxies, whose nuclear emission has been previously (Paper I) discussed. We use a sample of 97 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear regions show LINER-like emission. We use the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry to estimate the chemical abundance ratios 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) in the HII regions across the disks in our sample, as well as in the nuclear parts where the LINER-like activity dominates. To fit the radial profiles we use a piecewise methodology which uses a non-fixed number of breaks to find the best fit for the data. We obtain that majority of our sample of galaxies exhibits departures from the single linear gradient both in 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) (as expected from the inside-out scenario). We investigate whether these departures are driven by galaxy properties (stellar mass, neutral gas mass, stellar velocity dispersion), finding not correlation at all. We also report that in most cases there is no correlation between the shape of the 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) radial profiles. We propose a model in which AGN (feed)back, acting at different scales depending on the galaxy and its evolutionary stage, might be responsible for these departures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10764v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hidden No More: Spotlight on tidal disruption events in active galactic nuclei <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Patrik Milán Veres<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Proceedings of "X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions and Repeating Nuclear Transients", 16-19 June 2025, ESAC, Madrid.

However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10742v1" target="_blank"><h2>Model independent approach towards measuring expansion and growth factor from next generation galaxy clustering and lensing angular power spectrum <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ziad Sakr<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> to be submitted - comments and request for missing references are welcomed<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work we perform Fisher forecasts on the expansion and the growth factors following model independent approaches from 3x2pt joint analysis of the galaxy lensing, clustering, and their cross-correlated spectra at the linear, and extending as well to non linear scales. For that, instead of choosing a specific model for the matter power spectrum, the main ingredient of these probes, we express it by parametrizing its components, such as the expansion and the growth factor, and those of the standard halo model and excursion set theory in several z bins, besides to the different bias and non-linear bias modelling functions. We apply the technique to Euclid, Rubin and SKA public specifications in the range 0.2 < z < 1.8 and show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the expansion E(z i ) and the growth factor G(z i ). We also show the change in gain in precision at each z- shell when going from pessimistic cut at linear scales to more optimistic non-linear settings, or the difference between using each survey alone or a combination of all of them, or the impact from fixing or adding more degrees of freedom in the non-linear modeling. We found that, in the most agnostic case, one can still reach high precision on E(z i ) in the order of the percent level when combining the three surveys at once while the growth factor G(z i ) has for the same settings one order of magnitude weaker constraints. We also found for both factors, an improvement that can reach one order of magnitude in precision when passing from linear to non-linear scales. We conclude that we will be able to constrain the two important factors of the background evolution and structure formation of the Universe when using non linear scales and the combined power of future surveys even in the most agnostic approaches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10707v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on the Population of Common Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of the LIGO and Virgo Detectors <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Doğa Veske, Zsuzsa Márka, Albert Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, such as progenitor dynamics and outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events. Complementing previous analyses, we used minimal assumptions to search for common sources of sub-threshold gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino candidates during the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We therefore derive constraints on the rate density of joint sources for each compact binary merger population as a function of the energy emitted in neutrinos. Only a fraction of the gravitational-wave sources emit neutrinos, if the neutrino emission has high bolometric energy ($>10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ erg).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10666v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can accreting isolated neutron stars be detected? <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marina Afonina, Anton Biryukov, Sergei Popov<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 4 figures, will be submitted to JHEAP in a few days to allow for comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We perform population synthesis modeling of isolated neutron stars in the Milky Way over its lifetime. Compared with previous studies, we use more detailed models of the interstellar medium and the magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars. We demonstrate that presently, the spin-down rate at the propeller stage is the main uncertain factor that influences the number of accreting isolated neutron stars. If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number. We suggest that future observations of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries recently discovered by Gaia can clarify these issues.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10650v1" target="_blank"><h2>OutLines: Modeling Spectral Lines from Winds, Bubbles, and Outflows <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sophia R.

Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10615v1" target="_blank"><h2>nDspec: a new Python library for modelling multi-dimensional datasets in X-ray astronomy <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Matteo Lucchini, Benjamin Ricketts, Phil Uttley, Daniela Huppenkothen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A, software available on Github atthis https URL, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The current fleet of X-ray telescopes produces a wealth of multi-dimensional data, allowing us to study sources in time, photon energy and polarization. At the same time, it has become increasingly clear that progress in our physical understanding will only come from studying these sources in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Enabling multi-dimensional studies of X-ray sources requires new theoretical models predicting these data sets, new methods to analyse them and a software framework to combine data, models and methods efficiently. In this paper, we introduce the alpha release of nDspec, a new python-based library designed to allow users to model one- and multi-dimensional datasets common to X-ray astronomy. In the alpha release, we focus on modelling time-averaged data as well as Fourier spectral-timing mode, but highlight how additional dimensions can be added. We discuss design philosophy and current features, and showcase an example use case by characterizing a NICER observation of a black hole X-ray binary. We also highlight current plans for extensions to other dimensions and new features.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10613v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inflation at the End of 2025: Constraints on $r$ and $n_s$ Using the Latest CMB and BAO Data <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> L.

Inflationary models make predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of initial density fluctuations. In light of relevant data releases this year, we present constraints on these two parameters using the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO) available. Using data from Planck, the South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and BICEP/Keck experiments, we derive $n_s=0.9682\,\pm\,0.0032$ and a 95% upper limit of $r<0.034$. This upper limit on $r$ is consistent with the official BICEP/Keck result given the numerical precision of the analyses and our choice to impose the self-consistency relation for single field slow-roll inflation on the tensor power spectrum; the $r$ constraint is not impacted by the additional CMB data. While adding DESI BAO data to the CMB data has a negligible impact on $r$, the $n_s$ constraint shifts upward to $0.9728\,\pm\,0.0029$, which favours monomial inflaton potentials with $N_\star\sim 50$ over Starobinsky $R^2$ or Higgs inflation with $N_\star = 51$ and $N_\star = 55$, respectively. This shift is caused by marginally significant differences between the CMB and DESI data that remain unexplained in the context of the standard model. We show that a class of polynomial $α$-attractor models can predict the CMB and CMB+DESI $n_s$ results with $N_\star=47.1$ and $N_\star=55.1$, respectively. While future data will improve our sensitivity to $r$, robust $n_s$ constraints are just as crucial to differentiate between inflation models. We make the data needed to reproduce the new CMB and BAO results and visualisation tools for $r$-$n_s$ figures to compare to any inflation model available https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/r_ns_2025 .</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10585v1" target="_blank"><h2>Is Dark Energy Dynamical in the DESI Era?

Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10574v1" target="_blank"><h2>MAUVE-MUSE: A Star Formation-driven Outflow Caught in the Act of Quenching the Stripped Virgo Galaxy NGC 4064 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Amy Attwater, Barbara Catinella, Luca Cortese, Timothy Davis, Toby Brown, A.

However, stripping alone cannot fully account for the removal of dense, star-forming gas in many satellites, particularly in their inner regions. Recent models and indirect observations have suggested that star formation-driven outflows may play a critical role in expelling this remaining gas, yet direct evidence for such feedback-driven quenching remains limited. Here we report the discovery of an ionized gas outflow in NGC 4064, a Virgo cluster satellite that has already lost most of its cold gas through environmental stripping. MUSE observations from the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) survey reveal a bi-polar outflow driven by residual, centrally concentrated star formation in NGC 4064 - despite its current star formation rate being ~0.4 dex below the star-forming main sequence due to prior interaction with the cluster environment. The outflow's mass loading factor is ~2, suggesting that stellar feedback could remove the remaining gas on timescales shorter than those required for depletion by star formation alone. These results demonstrate that even modest but centrally concentrated star formation can drive efficient feedback in stripped satellites, accelerating quenching in the final stages of their evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10564v2" target="_blank"><h2>Wind-mediated Eddington-limited emission in a $10^{4}M_\odot$ Black Hole Tidal Disruption Event <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Paola Martire, Elena Maria Rossi, Nicholas Chamberlain Stone, Elad Steinberg, Konstantinos Kilmetis, Itai Linial<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have already produced tens of strong candidate flares, and their number will greatly increase with upcoming wide field surveys. Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of ~few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST (g and r band) and ULTRASAT (near UV) will be able to observe events like our simulated IMBH TDE up to redshifts of z$\approx$0.1 and z$\approx$0.06, respectively.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10533v1" target="_blank"><h2>Application of time-series analysis methods to a multiple-sector TESS observations: the case of the radio-loud blazar 3C 371 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ashutosh Tripathi, Paul J.

We determine variability timescales and search for quasi-periodicity using these methods and assess any differences. In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10530v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological and lunar laser ranging constraints on evolving dark energy in a nonminimally coupled curvature-matter gravity model <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Riccardo March, Miguel Barroso Varela, Orfeu Bertolami, Giada Bargiacchi, Marco Muccino, Simone Dell'Agnello<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10489v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scintillating insights into PSR~J0737$-$3039A and the interstellar plasma of the Gum Nebula from MeerKAT <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

Here, we present a scintillation analysis of the system based on an 18-month observation campaign with the MeerKAT radio telescope. We characterise this interference pattern to infer properties of scattering plasma and the orbital geometry of the system. Our preferred model supports a scattering screen located at a distance of $D_s = 360^{+30}_{-40}$ pc. This moderately anisotropic screen of ionized gas (axial ratio $A_R = 2.4 \pm 0.2$) lies near the edge of the Gum Nebula, which is believed to be a supernova remnant (SNR) or an \HII\, region. We estimate the expansion velocity of the nebula to be $V_{\textrm{s}} = 35 \pm 5$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a SNR age of $t \approx 1$ Myr. We also constrain the orbital orientation and inclination sense of the double pulsar to be $Ω= 40^{\circ} \pm 3^{\circ}$ and $i > 90^{\circ}$, respectively. Assuming standard scattering geometry, our model yields a distance estimate consistent with the parallax-derived value of $D = 770 \pm 70$ pc from very long baseline interferometry.

Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\barν_e$ mean energy $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\mathcal{L_ν}$ for both $ν_e$ and $\barν_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\barν_e$ emission while suppressing that of $ν_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L_{ν_e}$ by increasing both $\mathcal{L}_{ν_e}$ and $\langle E_{ν_e}\rangle$ whereas for $\barν_e$, the rise in $\mathcal{L}_{\barν_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\langle E_{\barν_e}\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L_{\barν_e}$. A systematic parameter scan of dipole field configurations suggests that, for $r_0 > 30$ km, $\langle E_{\barν_e} \rangle$ is significantly suppressed and $L_{ν_e}$ is enhanced if $B_0 \geq {2.7} \times 10^{16}$ G. These magnetic effects become negligible for $B_0$ below $\sim {7.4} \times 10^{15}$ G.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10383v1" target="_blank"><h2>The LEGA-C galaxy survey: multiple quenching channels for quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1$ <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Angelos Nersesian, Yasha Kaushal, Marco Martorano, Arjen van der Wel, Po-Feng Wu, Rachel Bezanson, Eric F.

The goal is to investigate the connection between galaxy sizes with SFH, stellar age, and metallicity. SFHs were derived with Prospector by fitting the high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 together with the broadband photometry from the UltraVISTA catalog. Galaxy sizes were measured by fitting a 2D S{é}rsic profile to the HST ACS~F814W images. We find diverse SFHs and quenching timescales ($τ_\rm{q}$). The main quiescent population quenched over $τ_\rm{q}=1.23\pm0.04$ Gyr, whereas compact post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) quenched much faster, $τ_\rm{q}=0.13\pm0.03$ Gyr. At fixed stellar mass, smaller quiescent galaxies quenched more rapidly than larger ones; at fixed size, the dependence on stellar mass is weak. Larger quiescent galaxies are marginally younger, quenched more slowly, and have near-solar metallicities, while compact quiescent galaxies are older, metal-rich, and quenched faster. PSBs formed half their mass later ($z_\rm{form}\sim1.9$) and quenched on the shortest timescales. The general trends with galaxy size, $Z_\star$, and $z_\rm{form}$ for the quiescent populations remain consistent regardless of the method used to derive the stellar properties. We conclude that compact quiescent galaxies are consistent with both early, moderately fast quenching and with more rapid, late quenching. While this may suggest the existence of multiple quenching channels, our data are also compatible with a continuous distribution of quenching timescales. These findings suggest that different physical mechanisms may drive quenching across galaxy populations, potentially leading to similar morphological outcomes despite differing evolutionary histories.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10344v1" target="_blank"><h2>Improved Identification of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves with Host Galaxy Locations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tonghua Liu, Kai Liao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 4 figures, comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a Bayesian framework that enhances the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves (GWs) by incorporating informative positional priors from the Euclid galaxy lens catalog. The core of our method introduces a two-step reweighting scheme: first, gravitational wave parameter estimation is performed under a uniform sky prior; the resulting posterior is then used to reweight galaxy positions within the Euclid catalog, constructing an astrophysically informed positional prior. Comparing this Euclid-informed prior against a uniform prior within our framework reveals distinct behaviors. While the posterior estimates of the intrinsic waveform parameters show little sensitivity to the prior change, the Bayes factor for lensing identification exhibits significant prior dependence. Crucially, for truly lensed event pairs, the Bayes factor systematically increases, whereas for unlensed pairs it decreases. This dual effect is vital for robust discrimination. Our analysis demonstrates that this multi-messenger approach significantly improves the confidence of lensing searches. For lensed pairs, the method boosts the Bayes factor by an average factor of $\sim 10$, while effectively suppressing false positives for unlensed coincidences. This underscores the critical importance of prior specification and showcases the substantial gains achievable by synergizing gravitational-wave data with electromagnetic survey information.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10298v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracking Protostellar Variability in Massive Protoclusters with ALMA: I.

Recent observations have also revealed significant (sub)millimeter variability in high-mass protostars, but the confirmed cases are scarce and lack systematic monitoring. In this work, we analyzed multi-epoch Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum observations of 22 massive protoclusters, with epoch separations ranging from a few hours to more than two years, while achieving a consistent angular resolution of approximately 0.3 arcsec. These data allow us to track variability of protostars across a broader mass range and in an environment markedly different from nearby clouds. Using a custom processing pipeline for data reduction, image alignment, and relative flux calibration, we achieve high-precision flux measurements and, for the first time, investigate millimeter variability in massive protoclusters based on interferometric data in a statistical manner. Applying the astrodendro algorithm, we identified 383 condensations and tracked their variations in peak intensities. Standard deviation analysis and difference maps reveal five variable sources, corresponding to a lower limit of 1.3% on the variable fraction. Among these, I13111-6228 stands out as it hosts a hypercompact H II region that exhibits a 68% increase in continuum peak intensity over one year, with an uncertainty of 2%. This supports the burst-mode accretion picture in massive star formation as a viable route for the formation of massive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10283v1" target="_blank"><h2>MorphZ: Enhancing evidence estimation through the Morph approximation <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> El Mehdi Zahraoui, Patricio Maturana-Russel, Avi Vajpeyi, Willem van Straten, Renate Meyer, Sergei Gulyaev<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce the Morph approximation, a class of product approximations of probability densities that selects low-order disjoint parameter blocks by maximizing the sum of their total correlations. We use the posterior approximation via Morph as the importance distribution in optimal bridge sampling. We denote this procedure by MorphZ, which serves as a post-processing estimator of the marginal likelihood. The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10249v1" target="_blank"><h2>Irregularity in Active Fast Radio Burst Repeaters and Magnetar Periodic Radio Pulses: Time, Energy, and Frequency Analyses <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ellen C.

Magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars and a leading progenitor candidate for FRBs also produce similar but much fainter millisecond radio pulses, suggesting a possible connection between the two phenomena. The irregularity of the time series of repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses may provide insight into the underlying progenitor activity. In this study, we analyze time-series data from three repeating FRB sources (four datasets) and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 to investigate potential patterns in burst arrival times, energy fluctuations, and peak-frequency shifts. We quantify the degree of randomness (Pincus Index; PI) and chaos (Largest Lyapunov Exponent; LLE) for these three parameters. We find that waiting times across all repeating FRBs exhibit high PI (high randomness) and low LLE (low chaos), consistent with the behavior of magnetar radio pulses. This similarity suggests that both may share a common triggering mechanism. In contrast, the energy fluctuations of both repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses occupy the same region in PI-LLE phase space but display much larger scatter than the other two domains. We discuss the possibility that beaming effects or strong variability in radio-emission efficiency may explain their distinct behavior in the energy domain.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10245v1" target="_blank"><h2>$^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 Observations of Tycho's supernova remnant: constraints on the environmental gas properties <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sendi Bo, Yu Huang, Ping Zhou, Tian-Yu Tu, Samar Safi-Harb, Zhi-Yu Zhang, Yang Chen, Hidetoshi Sano<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 5 figures.

To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10239v1" target="_blank"><h2>EP250827b/SN 2025wkm: An X-ray Flash-Supernova Powered by a Central Engine and Circumstellar Interaction <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gokul P.

EP250827b possesses a prompt X-ray luminosity of $\sim 10^{45} \, \rm{erg \, s^{-1}}$, lasts over 1000 seconds, and has a peak energy $E_{\rm{p}} < 1.5$ keV at 90% confidence. SN 2025wkm possesses a double-peaked light curve (LC), though its bolometric luminosity plateaus after its initial peak for $\sim 20$ days, giving evidence that a central engine is injecting additional energy into the explosion. Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg. In the model we invoke, the collapse gives rise to a long-lived magnetar, potentially surrounded by an accretion disk. Magnetically-driven winds from the magnetar and the disk mix together, and break out with a velocity $\sim 0.35c$ from an extended circumstellar medium with radius $\sim 10^{13}$ cm, generating X-ray breakout emission through free-free processes. The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC. The spin-down luminosity of the magnetar in combination with the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni produces the late-time SN LC. We end by discussing the landscape of XRF-SNe within the context of EP's recent discoveries.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10228v1" target="_blank"><h2>FEADME: Fast Elliptical Accretion Disk Modeling Engine</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nicholas Earl, K.

Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$α$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10222v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Phase-Space and Field-Level Cosmology: The Strength of Semi-Analytic Models <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Natalí S.

They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $Ω_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10186v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Narrow Emission Lines of Seyfert 1 Galaxies: Comparisons with a Large SDSS Sample</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Matthew Malkan, Lisbeth Jensen, Lei Hao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages, 12 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-11<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title, abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyzed a large sample of SDSS spectra of Seyfert galaxies, subdividing Seyfert 1s based on their narrow-to-broad Halpha components. Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag. Our data do not support the simplest version of Seyfert 1 and 2 unification, where both AGN classes have identical NL.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10167v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectrally Resolved Gas Kinematics in Cygnus A: XRISM Detects AGN Jet-induced Velocity Dispersion in Multi-temperature Gas</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anwesh Majumder, T.

Analyzing the full field of view spectrum in the $1.7-12.0$ keV band, we find evidence for two-temperature cluster gas. The hotter ($kT = 5.53 \pm 0.13$ keV) gas has a velocity dispersion of $261 \pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ and a bulk velocity of $120 \pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central galaxy. The cooler gas ($kT = 2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ keV) has an even broader velocity dispersion of $440 \pm 130$ km s$^{-1}$, with a systematic uncertainty of $120$ km s$^{-1}$. The relative line-of-sight velocity between the hotter and cooler gas can be as high as $450 \pm 140$ km s$^{-1}$. We interpret the high velocity dispersions as a combination of turbulence and bulk motion due to the cocoon shock. The upper limit on the non-thermal pressure fraction for the hotter gas is $7.7 \pm 0.7\%$. We associate the cooler gas with the central region ($<35$ kpc) and the hotter phase with the gas surrounding it ($35-100$ kpc). The total energy due to the kinetic motion is $5.1 \times 10^{60}$ erg, consistent with the energy associated with the central radio source. The kinetic energy injection rate is $6.9 \times 10^{44}-7.4 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ under varying assumptions of injection timescales. The range of injection power is higher than the cooling luminosity, and thus the heating and cooling rates in Cygnus A are unbalanced.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10164v1" target="_blank"><h2>Strong Bars, Strong Inflow: The Effect of Bar Strength on Gas Inflow</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Maelle Magnan, Tobias Geron, Izzy L.

We collected spectroscopic data using the Isaac Newton Telescope to analyze 18 nearby galaxies (strongly barred, weakly barred, and unbarred) drawn from Galaxy Zoo DESI. We obtained spatial profiles of equivalent width (EW) and ionized gas velocity dispersion by fitting Gaussian profiles to the Hα emission line. Strongly barred galaxies exhibit a distinctive three-peaked EW[Hα] structure, consistent with inward funneling of gas. Weakly barred systems lack this pattern, which suggests limited inflow. Velocity dispersion distributions further distinguish the bar types, with strongly barred galaxies showing significantly higher values than weakly barred and unbarred systems. These results suggest that strong bars drive gas inflow, while weak bars exert a limited dynamical influence.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10163v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of Weak O VI Absorption in Underdense Regions of the Low-Redshift Intergalactic Medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sapna Mishra, Vikram Khaire, Romeo Pallikkara, Anand Narayanan, Andrew J.

We perform a spectral stacking analysis at the expected location of the O VI doublet, revealing O VI absorption with a statistical significance greater than 5$σ$, and measure an equivalent width of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.3 mA, corresponding to log (N_OVI ) = 12.14 $\pm$ 0.08. The stacked O VI absorption signal associated with strong Lya absorbers (13.5 <= log N_HI < 14.5) is significantly stronger than that associated with weaker Lya absorbers (12.5 <= log N_HI < 13.5). For the subset of 81 broad Lya absorbers (BLAs; b(HI) > 45 km/s), we obtain a marginal $\sim$3 $σ$ O VI detection. Other than Si III, detected at 5$σ$, no associated metal lines are found. Cross-correlation of the Lya absorbers with galaxies indicates that 93% of these absorbers are not associated with bright galaxies within 1 Mpc, implying that the detected O VI originates in the diffuse IGM rather than the circumgalactic medium. The stacked O VI signal suggests characteristic metallicities of $\sim 0.01\,Z_{\odot}$ under photoionisation and $\sim 0.001\,Z_{\odot}$ under collisional ionisation conditions, though these estimates are model-dependent and assume that O VI and H I trace the same phase. This study provides the first observational evidence for metal absorption in low-column-density Lya systems that individually exhibit no detectable metals, placing important constraints on the metal enrichment of the underdense IGM.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10143v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deuterium fractionation and CO depletion in Barnard 5</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Igor Petrashkevich, Anna Punanova, Paola Caselli, Jaime E.

We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10023v1" target="_blank"><h2>Classification of a New X-ray Catalog of Likely Counterparts to 4FGL-DR4 Unassociated Gamma-ray Sources Using a Neural Network <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kyle D.

We use these parameters as inputs for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier (NNC) trained to classify sources as blazars, pulsars, or ambiguous gamma-ray sources. For the 213 singlet sources with X-ray and optical data, we classify 173 as likely blazars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} > 0.99$) and 6 as likely pulsars ($P_\mathrm{bzr} < 0.01$), with 34 sources yielding ambiguous results.

In this work, we study the properties of outflows in AGN (mostly X-ray-selected) from the GOODS-S field, exploiting JWST NIRSpec IFU observations as part of the GA-NIFS GTO survey. Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~$10^{45-46}$ erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (>75\%), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of <1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 $M_\odot$/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with $L_{\rm bol}$ and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z>3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09993v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing the Roman Grism Redshift Efficiency of Type Ia Supernova Host Galaxies for the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

To construct the Roman SN Hubble diagram, a strategy to obtain redshifts must be determined. While the nominal HLTDS will use only the Roman prism, in this work we consider the utility of the Roman grism observations from overlap with the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey for SNIa cosmology. We determine a galaxy grism redshift recovery rate by simulating dispersed grism images and measuring redshifts with the Grizli software, obtaining an $H$-band 50% redshift recovery at magnitude 20.61 and 90% recovery at magnitude 19.27. To estimate the total number of spectroscopic redshifts expected for Roman SN cosmology, we also consider a Roman prism SN redshift efficiency and a ground-based telescope redshift efficiency for host-galaxies. We apply these redshift efficiencies to SNIa catalog level simulations and predict that $\sim$6800 SNe will have a SN or host spectroscopic redshift. Second, we evaluate the size of potential systematics related to modeling the grism redshift efficiency by considering the impact of additional dependencies on stellar mass and host galaxy color. We estimate the largest potential size of this systematic to be 0.0066$\pm$0.002 and -0.0266$\pm$0.007, roughly 42.9 and 49.6% of the statistical uncertainty for $w_0$ and $w_a$ respectively.

When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\pm0.36{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $Λ$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09985v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark matter mounds from the collapse of supermassive stars: a general-relativistic analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Roberto Caiozzo, Gianfranco Bertone, Piero Ullio, Rodrigo Vicente, Bradley J.

However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter "spike" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or "mound". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09987v1" target="_blank"><h2>Orbital migration and heating history of the Galactic disc: a transition between the bimodal discs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> HanYuan Zhang, Vasily Belokurov, Jason L.

The history of their secular evolution is imprinted in the current kinematics and age-metallicity distribution. We construct a chrono-chemo-dynamical model of the disc, incorporating inside-out growth, metallicity evolution, radial migration, and heating to fit the observed age-metallicity-kinematics distribution of LAMOST subgiant stars in both the low and high-$α$ disc. By modelling all distribution parameters with spline fitting, we present the first non-parametric stellar migration and heating history of the Galaxy. We determine the heating-to-migration ratio, the ratio of the root-mean-square changes in radial/vertical and azimuthal actions, to be $\approx0.075$ for radial to azimuthal actions and $\approx0.015$ for vertical to azimuthal actions, implying a highly anisotropic diffusion in the action space. Furthermore, we identify a transition in radial migration efficiency coinciding with the transition moment of the bimodal disc, for which the radial migration was more efficient for the high-$α$ disc than for the low-$α$ disc. This transition may be attributed to two correlated scenarios: 1) a bar formation epoch accompanied by violent outward migration, and 2) a drop in the gas mass fraction in the disc when the low-$α$ disc began to form. These findings offer further constraints on the formation mechanisms of bimodal discs, favouring the downsizing scenario. We also briefly discuss the connection between our results and recent high-redshift observations. In addition to the secular evolution history, our model maps the Milky Way ISM metallicity gradient at different lookback times, which we find has only varied a little (in the range of $-0.07~\rm to~-0.10~dex/kpc$) since disc formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09989v1" target="_blank"><h2>ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eric Putney, David Shih, Sung Hak Lim, Matthew R.

The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09990v1" target="_blank"><h2>The mysterious Globular Cluster population of MATLAS-2019 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sergio Guerra Arencibia, Mireia Montes, Giulia Golini, Ignacio Trujillo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 21 figures.

In this paper we take advantage of HST's multi-wavelength coverage (F475W, F606W and F814W observations) with the addition of deep u-band imaging from Gran Telescopio de Canarias, to perform the most detailed study and estimation to date of the GC population of the ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-2019. The improved constraints provided by the combination of high spatial resolution and better coverage of the GC spectral energy distribution has allowed us to obtain a clean sample of GCs in this galaxy. We report a number of 33+-3 GCs in MATLAS-2019, supporting the previous lower estimates for this galaxy. The GC population of this galaxy is highly concentrated with ~80% of the GCs inside the effective radius (Re) of the galaxy and the GC half-number radius Re,GC is 0.7Re. Using the GC-Halo mass relation, we estimate a halo mass for MATLAS-2019 of (1.14+-0.1)x10**11 solar masses. The GC luminosity function and the distribution of effective radii of the GCs favour a distance to the galaxy of 20.0+-0.9 Mpc. In agreement with previous findings, we find that the distribution of GCs is highly asymmetric even though the distribution of stars in the galaxy is symmetric. This suggests that assumptions about the symmetry of the GC distribution may be incorrect when used to calculate the number of GCs with such low statistics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09981v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rhea-RT: Dynamical impact of Central Molecular Zone conditions on ISM properties and stellar feedback coupling <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\rm cell}=20$ M$_\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09980v1" target="_blank"><h2>UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mattéo Blamart, Adrian Liu, Robert Brandenberger, Julian B.

These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $Gμ\lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09983v1" target="_blank"><h2>KURVS: chemical properties from multiple strong line calibrations for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zefeng Li, Ugnė Dudzevičiūtė, Annagrazia Puglisi, Steven Gillman, A.

Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09978v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational-wave parameter estimation to the Moon and back: massive binaries and the case of GW231123</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Francesco Iacovelli, Jacopo Tissino, Jan Harms, Emanuele Berti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the prospects of the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), a proposed deci-Hz GW detector, to observe binary black holes (BBHs) and enable multiband science with ground-based detectors. We assess the detectability of the events observed by current instruments up to the GWTC-4.0 data release, and of simulated populations consistent with the latest reconstruction by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that LGWA alone would have been able to observe more than one third of the events detected so far, and that it could detect $\sim\!90$ events merging in the ground-based band per year out to redshifts $z\sim3-5$. Current detectors at design sensitivity and 100% duty cycle could detect thousands of BBHs per year, with one to a few hundred multiband counterparts in LGWA. Third-generation (3G) detectors can observe most of the BBHs detected by LGWA merging in their frequency band in the simulated mass range $7\,{\rm M}_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm tot}\lesssim 600\,{\rm M}_\odot$, enabling systematic joint analyses of hundreds of events. The short time to merger from the deci-Hz band to the Hz-kHz band (typically months to a year) allows for early warning, targeted follow-up, and archival searches. Multiband observations of intermediate-mass BBHs in the deci-Hz band are particularly promising. We perform an injection study for a GW231123-like system (the most massive BBH detection to date, which accumulates $\sim 10^5$ inspiral cycles in LGWA) and show that deci-Hz observations can measure the chirp mass even better than 3G instruments and yield good sky localization and inclination measurement, even with a single observatory. Opening the deci-Hz band would substantially improve the prospects of GW astronomy for intermediate-mass BBHs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09891v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-consistent secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies and extragalactic foregrounds in the FLAMINGO simulations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tianyi Yang, Ian G.

Starting from lightcone-based HEALPix maps and catalogues, we present a new set of mock CMB maps constructed in a self-consistent manner from the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, including CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, cosmic infrared background, radio point source and anisotropic screening maps. We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks. The mock CMB maps should provide a valuable resource for exploring correlations between different secondary anisotropies and other large-scale structure tracers, and can be applied to forecasts for upcoming surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09889v2" target="_blank"><h2>Clumpy, dense gas in the outflow of NGC 1266 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Justin Atsushi Otter, Katherine Alatalo, Kate Rowlands, Pallavi Patil, Maya Skarbinski, Lauren Dysarz, Mark Lacy, Maria J.

NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of < 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09866v1" target="_blank"><h2>Beyond Two Parameters: Revisiting Dark Energy with the Latest Cosmic Probes <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hanyu Cheng, Supriya Pan, Eleonora Di Valentino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages including references, 9 figures, 2 tables; comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-10<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dark energy (DE) models with many free parameters are often considered excessive, as constraining all parameters poses a significant challenge. On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($Δ_{\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 > -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $Λ$CDM scenario, based on both $Δχ^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09852v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial non-Gaussianity -- Fast simulations and persistent summary statistics <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Juan Calles, Gabriella Contardo, Jorge Noreña, Jacky H.

First, we introduce a new simulation suite for PNG, PNG-pmwd, comprising more than $20{,}000$ halo catalogs that vary individually local and equilateral shapes, together with variations in $Ω_m$ and $σ_8$. Second, we carry out a systematic comparison of topological descriptors, as well as powerspectrum and bispectrum measurements, evaluating their constraining power on both local and equilateral $f_{\rm NL}$ and how this sensitivity varies with halo mass. This dataset enables likelihood-free neural regression of $f_{\rm NL}$ across multiple halo mass bins for a wide range of summary statistics. Third, we assess the transferability of these learned mappings by testing whether models trained on fast pmwd simulations can robustly infer on simulations from the QuijotePNG suite. We find that a combination of simple descriptive statistics of the topological features (PD-statistics) leads to the best performance to constrain equilateral PNG. We observe that the constraining power of these summaries comes from large-mass halos, with small-mass halos adding noise and degrading performance. Similarly, we find that the transferability of the learned mappings, for both topological and powerspectrum plus bispectrum, degrades if small scales or small-mass halos are included.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09845v1" target="_blank"><h2>Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Orhan Donmez, G.

Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09815v1" target="_blank"><h2>Footprints in the Wind: Probing X-ray Outflows in NGC 7469 using Near-Infrared Emission Lines <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Léa M.

Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09767v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting the X-ray-to-UV relation of Quasars in the era of all-sky surveys <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Maria Chira, Antonis Georgakakis, Angel Ruiz, Shi-Jiang Chen, Johannes Buchner, Amy L.

Previous studies suggest that disc-dominated emission becomes more prominent with increasing optical luminosity. However, the redshift evolution of this relation remains debated, and a dependence on Eddington ratio, predicted by accretion flow models, is still observationally unconstrained. We revisit this relation using a large, nearly all-sky sample by combining the SDSS DR16Q QSO catalogue with X-ray data from XMM-Newton and the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey DR1, yielding 136,745 QSOs at redshifts $0.5 \leq z < 3.0$. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework that treats X-ray detections and upper limits uniformly, enabling robust inference from both parametric and non-parametric models. We confirm a tight, sublinear $\log L_X({\rm 2\,keV})$-$\log L_ν({\rm 2500\,\mathring{A}})$ correlation, but with a normalization at the lower end of previous estimates. Contrary to most literature results, we detect a mild but systematic redshift evolution: the relation flattens and its intrinsic scatter decreases at higher redshift. This trend is consistent with disc emission increasingly dominated by scattering and enhanced energy transfer to the X-ray corona, potentially indicating redshift evolution in the X-ray bolometric correction. We find no significant dependence on Eddington ratio, in tension with recent accretion flow models.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 93 papers (46 new, 47 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
