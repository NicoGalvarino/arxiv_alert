groups and clusters, using the photometric DESI Legacy Survey together with
cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT). We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit
cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps
are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that
allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We
investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB),
finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT
frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB
temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial
velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the
total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We
find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial
radius.The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal
baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim
M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$
times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to
be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content
reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is
consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and
plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these
haloes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11772v1" target="_blank"><h2>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds

redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in
astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must
have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds
in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the
Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model
the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported
envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the
progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation
introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and
saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind
and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington
radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes
to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection
models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher
than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can
dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless
balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical
limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds
capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra.
Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation
hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the
quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12411v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extremely UV-bright starbursts at the end of cosmic reionization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R.

identified in SHELLQs survey. Stacking their rest-frame UV spectra reveals a
prominent NV1240A P-Cygni, consistent with very young (~6Myr) stellar
populations dominated by massive stars. They are thus powerful and efficient
ionizing starbursts with an average ionizing photon production efficiency of
log(Xi_ion/Hz erg-1)=25.54. For one of these, J0217-0208 at z=6.2 (MUV=-23.4),
we analyzed NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Its SED indicates a young (~5Myr), compact
(reff~260pc) starburst with a stellar mass of 10^9Msun and high sSFR
(~100Gyr^-1). This translates to high stellar mass and SFR surface densities,
about 100x higher than typical galaxies at similar redshifts. NIRSpec further
reveals strong nebular emission, for which we derive a high electron density
(~10^3 cm^-3), a metallicity 12+log(O/H)=8.20 (from the direct method), and a
super-solar N/O ratio (log(N/O)=-0.30). Furthermore, J0217-0208 shows broad
components in several rest-optical lines, indicating powerful ionized outflows,
which appear heavily obscured (E(B-V)~0.6), in contrast to the nearly dust-free
stellar continuum (E(B-V)~0.01). Combined with ALMA detections of a massive,
extended, and cold dust reservoir, these findings point to dusty,
feedback-driven outflows carrying and pushing dust well beyond the stellar
core, boosting the observed UV luminosity. Our results suggest that UV-bright
galaxies at high redshift represent short-lived but extreme phases of rapid
stellar mass growth, efficient ionizing photon production, and strong feedback.
The extreme properties of J0217-0208, such as supersolar N/O, steep UV slope,
compact size, and very high surface densities, closely mirror those of the
brightest galaxies at z>10, suggesting a shared evolutionary pathway.[Abridged]</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12263v1" target="_blank"><h2>Is Milky Way stable all the way ? A TNG50 view from cosmic noon to the

\texttt{TNG50} simulation against the growth of local axisymmetric
instabilities, tracing their evolution from cosmic noon ($z=2.5$) to the
present day ($z=0$). Using a two-component stability criterion that accounts
for stars, gas, and the force field of the dark matter halo, we compute the net
stability parameter ($Q_{T}$), the critical gas surface density ($\Sigma_{c}$),
and the instability timescale ($\tau$) for 10 barred and 10 unbarred MWAs. We
find that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all
epochs, with $Q_{T}^{\min}>2$. The stability levels increase toward higher
redshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the
destabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs
consistently show lower $Q_{T}^{\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density
remains subcritical ($\Sigma_{g}<\Sigma_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying
that local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star
formation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but
increase exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining
the concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the
effect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are
stable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q_{T}>1)$, a combination of gas
dissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even
when $Q_{T}>1$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11790v1" target="_blank"><h2>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from

astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable
consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW
events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection
of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources
of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties.
Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise
contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the
astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of
unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR)
depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed
astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have
performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated
population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of
the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold
signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs
of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter
space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over
which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW
pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique
will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW
detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11780v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cross-correlation of Luminous Red Galaxies with ML-selected AGN in

host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of
supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution
(HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions
between $1.5\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\sim28,500$ Hyper
Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \mu
m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at
physical scales $s>0.1\,{\rm Mpc}$, for $z\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I
(unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and
large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on
average, in substantially ($\sim3\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \sim
10^{13.4} M_\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \sim 10^{12.9} M_\odot$) at
$>5\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar
to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo
clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation
with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely
($f_{sat}\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type
II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for
their inferred average halo mass ($\sim10^{13} M_\odot$), with $f_{sat} \sim
20^{+10}_{-5}\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to
the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's
spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo
environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of
the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic
galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12645v1" target="_blank"><h2>Searching for Stellar-Feedback-Driven Outflow Signatures: A Deep Dive

low-mass galaxies whose shallow gravitational potential wells make them
particularly susceptible to mass and metal loss through outflows. However,
spatially resolved observations of stellar-feedback-driven outflows are limited
due to their low-surface brightness and transient nature. We present the pilot
of a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying
stellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally
resolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for
outflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical
imaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA
21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST
photometry. With this extensive dataset, we compare the neutral and ionized gas
morphologies and kinematics, calculate mass-loading factors, and investigate
spatial variations in the star formation history of NGC 3741. Though the galaxy
is experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong
outflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though
star formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the
galaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to
produce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling
outflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how
stellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper
understanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar

by combining five new XRISM/Resolve pointings observed in 2025 with four
Performance Verification datasets from 2024, totaling 745 ks net exposure. To
date, Perseus remains the only cluster that has been extensively mapped out to
~0.7$r_{2500}$ by XRISM/Resolve, while simultaneously offering sufficient
spatial resolution to resolve gaseous substructures driven by mergers and AGN
feedback. Our observations cover multiple radial directions and a broad
dynamical range, enabling us to characterize the intracluster medium kinematics
up to the scale of ~500 kpc. In the measurements, we detect high velocity
dispersions ($\simeq$300 km/s) in the eastern region of the cluster,
corresponding to a nonthermal pressure fraction of $\simeq$7-13%. The velocity
field outside the AGN-dominant region can be effectively described by a single,
large-scale kinematic driver based on the velocity structure function, which
statistically favors an energy injection scale of at least a few hundred kpc.
The estimated turbulent dissipation energy is comparable to the gravitational
potential energy released by a recent merger, implying a significant role of
turbulent cascade in the merger energy conversion. In the bulk velocity field,
we observe a dipole-like pattern along the east-west direction with an
amplitude of $\simeq\pm$200-300 km/s, indicating rotational motions induced by
the recent merger event. This feature constrains the viewing direction to
~30$^\circ$-50$^\circ$ relative to the normal of the merger plane. Our
hydrodynamic simulations suggest that Perseus has experienced at least two
energetic mergers since redshift z~1, the latest associated with the radio
galaxy IC310. This study showcases exciting scientific opportunities for future
missions with high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities (e.g., HUBS, LEM, and
NewAthena).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12122v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Possible Shutting-Down Event of Mass Accretion in An Active Galactic

and near-infrared wavelengths in a quasar at z=1.767 by a factor of 20-30 (in

fading trend in brightness was first identified by comparing the magnitudes
measured in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images with those in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images for ~3x10^4 quasars spectroscopically
identified by SDSS. We performed follow-up observations, including optical
imaging and spectroscopy as well as near-infrared imaging, with >4m-class
telescopes such as Subaru, GTC, Keck, and SOAR telescopes. We combine these new
data with the archival data to examine the variability behavior over ~20 years
in detail and even the longer-term trend of the variability over ~70 years in
the observed frame. We find that (i) the AGN component likely faded by a factor
of ~50 from the early 2000s to 2023 and (ii) the observed brightness decline is
best explained by a substantial decrease in accretion rate rather than
time-varying line-of-sight dust obscuration. These findings are derived from
multi-component (time-varying AGN + constant galaxy) spectral energy
distribution fitting over multi-epochs, which is well consistent with the
optical spectra. The Eddington ratio decreases by a factor of ~50, from ~0.4 to
~0.008 if we use the black hole mass measured with the SDSS spectrum, which
could be highly uncertain because of the very large variability. The total
brightness is dominated by the host galaxy in the rest-frame optical wavelength

accretion and shaping the surrounding molecular clouds. These flows, traced by
molecular species at (sub)millimeter wavelengths (e.g., CO, SiO, SO, H$_2$CO,
and CH$_3$OH) and by atomic, ionized, and molecular lines in the infrared
(e.g., H$_2$, [Fe II], [S I]), originate from protostellar accretion disks
deeply embedded within dusty envelopes. Jets play a crucial role in removing
angular momentum from the disk, thereby enabling continued mass accretion,
while directly preserving a record of the protostar's outflow history and
potentially providing indirect insights into its accretion history. Recent
advances in high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations, particularly with
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the infrared and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, have
revolutionized studies of protostellar jets and outflows. These instruments
provide complementary views of warm, shock-excited gas and cold molecular

status of observational studies that reveal detailed structures, kinematics,
and chemical compositions of protostellar jets and outflows. Recent analyses of
mass-loss rates, velocities, rotation, molecular abundances, and magnetic
fields provide critical insights into jet launching mechanisms, disk evolution,
and the potential formation of binary systems and planets. The synergy of
JWST's infrared sensitivity and ALMA's high-resolution imaging is advancing our
understanding of jets and outflows. Future large-scale, high-resolution surveys
with these facilities are expected to drive major breakthroughs in outflow

have uncovered a population of massive galaxies, exceeding $10^{10}$ solar
masses, present less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The large stellar
masses of these galaxies require an efficient conversion of baryons into stars,
which may exceed theoretical expectations. However, the formation process of
massive galaxies so early in the Universe's history is perplexing, as
observations provide limited information to constrain their evolutionary
pathways. Here, we present multi-wavelength observations of a galaxy complex
consisting of at least five galaxies within a $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ region,
referred to as the \quintet, using JWST and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This system, located in the core of a galaxy
protocluster at approximately 650 million years after the Big Bang, reveals the
detailed physical processes involved in the formation of massive galaxies.
These processes include a dynamic cycles of merger induced gas stripping,
leading the temporal termination of star formation, and recycling of the
stripped gas, with subsequent enhancement of star formation in other galaxies
of the system, which is expected to evolve into massive galaxies that host more
than $10^{10}$ solar masses of stars. The new observations represent the first
comprehensive evidence of a massive galaxy formation through gas-rich,
multiple-galaxy mergers induced by a dense protocluster environment in the
$650\,{\rm Myrs}$ after the Big Bang. Our results suggest that the protocluster
core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid
evolution in the early Universe, as predicted by theoretical studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11788v1" target="_blank"><h2>ELPIS: Accelerated metal and dust enrichment in a proto-cluster core at

stellar and gas content of galaxies at Cosmic Noon. The survey consists of deep
spectroscopy for 153 targets observed over two pointings in the COSMOS field
using the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA). We employ the three
medium-resolution gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, with exposure times of 13
hours, 3.2 hours, and 1.6 hours, respectively. We thus obtain full coverage of
the 1-5 micron range, corresponding to the entire rest-frame optical wavelength
range. The sample is carefully selected to provide a census of galaxies over
the redshift range 1.7 < z < 3.5 above a redshift-dependent minimum stellar
mass that ranges from 10^8.7 Msun to 10^9.3 Msun.The Blue Jay sample is
representative of the entire galaxy population at these redshifts, without
strong biases in color, star formation rate, or other properties. The sizes of
massive galaxies at these redshifts are comparable to the NIRSpec shutters,
which requires custom strategies for designing and reducing the observations.
Since the standard A-B nod subtraction leads to flux self-subtraction, we
construct a master background from empty shutters and subtract it from each of
the science spectra. This, in turn, allows for the use of shorter slitlets
consisting of only two shutters per galaxy instead of the usual three, with a
substantial increase in the multiplexing of the NIRSpec MSA. We measure
multi-band photometry using archival JWST and HST observations in two different
ways: in a large elliptical aperture encompassing the entire source and from
the exact area in the sky where the NIRSpec 1D spectrum is extracted. This
enables self-consistent fits of spectroscopic and photometric data. The Blue
Jay dataset, which we publicly release, represents the ideal sample for
studying the stellar populations, neutral gas, and ionized gas in Cosmic Noon
galaxies.</p></br></body>
