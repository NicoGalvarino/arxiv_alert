Sullivan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent results from DESI BAO analyses suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant and is in fact dynamical. Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5σ$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1σ$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3σ$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1σ$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7σ$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23459v1" target="_blank"><h2>Baryon fraction from the BAO amplitude: a consistent approach to parameterizing perturbation growth</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrea Crespi, Will J.

This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23452v1" target="_blank"><h2>From metallicity distributions to mutual information: A new perspective on stellar halo assembly</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Amit Mondal, Biswajit Pandey<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 7 figures, comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The metallicity structure of stellar halos encodes the fossil record of galaxy assembly, tracing the chemical evolution and dynamical imprint of past mergers. Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23432v1" target="_blank"><h2>A measurement of $H_0$ from DESI DR1 using energy densities</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alex Krolewski, Andrea Crespi, Will J.

We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($Ω_{\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $Λ$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant. We consider the impact of non-standard dark energy evolution on our measurement. Future data, including that from further iterations of DESI and from Euclid, will add to these results providing a powerful test of the Hubble tension.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23426v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variation of Microphysical Parameters in Reverse-shock Scenario</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nissim Fraija, Boris Betancourt-Kamenetskaia, Antonio Galván, Maria Dainotti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 36 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables.

The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone. The current model is employed to examine the evolution of the spectral and temporal indices of GRBs reported in the Second Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) and bursts detected at very high energies, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23417v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detection of the Pairwise Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Pairwise Velocity with DESI DR1 Galaxies and ACT DR6 and Planck CMB Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yulin Gong, Patricio A.

This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23356v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Impacts of AGN Activities on Dwarf Galaxies with FAST HI Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hong-Ying Chen, Chao-Wei Tsai, Pei Zuo, Niankun Yu, Jialai Wang, Kai Zhang, Guodong Li, Yogesh Chandola, Zheng Zheng, Jingwen Wu, Di Li, Lulu Bao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the results of Hi line observations towards 26 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)-hosting and one star-forming dwarf galaxies (Mstar < 10^9.5 Msun) with the 19-beam spectral line receiver of FAST at 1.4 GHz. Our FAST observed targets are combined with other AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies covered in the ALFALFA footprint to form a more comprehensive sample. Utilizing the information from optical surveys, we further divide them into isolated and accompanied subsamples by their vicinity of nearby massive galaxies. We compare the Hi gas abundance and star-forming rate (SFR) between the subsamples to assess the role of internal and external processes that may regulate the gas content in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we find that AGN are more commonly identified in accompanied dwarf galaxies than in their isolated counterparts. Meanwhile, AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies have slightly but significant lower Hi mass fraction relatively to the non-AGN control sample in accompanied dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23349v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synchrotron Self-Compton Model of TeV Afterglows in Gamma-Ray Bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$. A shallower external medium density profile ($k<2$) departs from the canonical approximation of a steady wind ($k=2$) from the progenitor star and may indicate a non-steady wind or a transition to an interstellar medium.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23314v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar streams around dwarf galaxies in the Local Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Joanna D.

Stellar streams trace satellite disruption and, in the dwarf galaxy regime, are predicted to provide novel constraints on low-mass galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the mass ratios required to form these streams make them challenging to detect. We present a preview of the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey (SSLS) in the dwarf galaxy regime. The SSLS aims to produce a statistically large, homogeneous sample of stellar streams, in order to yield new constraints on galaxy formation through comparison with theory. We visually inspect dwarf galaxies using the Legacy Imaging Survey (and DECaLS footprints, r-band 29 mag arcsec-2) within 4-35 Mpc. We develop a classification metric to categorise accretion debris around dwarf galaxies, and measure the frequency of accretion features in the footprint. We present the first release of accretion features around dwarf galaxies, including 1 stream, 11 shells, and 8 asymmetric stellar halos, of which 17 constitute new identifications. We find that less than 5.07 percent of dwarfs (37/730) contain detectable accretion features, which is lower than the SSLS results for massive galaxies, and discuss a tentative shell detection bias. Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarf galaxies, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies. Nevertheless, they place observational constraints on hierarchical mass assembly in this regime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23305v1" target="_blank"><h2>Calcium versus silicon ejecta velocities and decline rates in supernovae Ia: The role of high-velocity features</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

We analyse a representative sample of 145 nearby SNe Ia observed within $\pm$5 days of B-band maximum light, including normal, 91T-, and 91bg-like events with measured light-curve decline rates ($Δm_{15}$) and Si II and Ca II line properties from the literature. We model PVF and HVF velocity distributions using Gaussian Mixture Models, compare Si II and Ca II PVF velocity distributions, assess Ca II HVF properties, and test correlations between Si II PVF velocities and $Δm_{15}$, with emphasis on HVF effects. For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($>3.3σ$) between $Δm_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($>3.3σ$) between Si II PVF velocity and $Δm_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction. These results underscore the critical role of HVFs and SN Ia subclass in interpreting ejecta kinematics in both models and observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23267v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating AGN feedback in galaxy clusters with pre-existing turbulence</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jia-Lun Li, H. -Y.

Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23263v1" target="_blank"><h2>Macroscopic Dark Matter under siege: from White Dwarf Data to Gravitational Wave Detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Siyu Jiang, Aidi Yang, Fa Peng Huang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8+12 pages, 3+6 figures, 0+1 table, comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The nature of dark matter (DM) remains a profound mystery.

Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23168v1" target="_blank"><h2>An improved formalism for measuring the dark matter subhalos mass by its gravitational wake</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23164v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bursty star formation, chemical enrichment, and star cluster formation in numerical analogues of GN-z11</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Takayuki R.

The origin of this chemical signature provides an insight into the early star and galaxy formation processes, yet remains unclear. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z\sim10$) in rare density peaks, incorporating various chemical evolution channels including stellar winds, core-collapse, Type Ia supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations reproduce several key features of high-redshift galaxies: (1) stars form with high efficiencies ($>0.1$) at the center of rare peak halos, creating very compact galaxies similar to GN-z11; (2) high N/O ratios emerge during the first 10-20 Myr of intense starburst, before being diluted by CCSNe; (3) multiple star clusters form in and around the galaxy with high efficiency ($\sim20\%$), some of which exhibit high N/O ratios and sodium-oxygen anti-correlations similar to those observed in local globular clusters. Although our simulations can reproduce the high log(N/O) values (up to -0.61, exceeding the solar value by 0.25 dex), they remain below the observational lower limits of GN-z11, indicating room for improvement through additional chemical evolution channels, such as supermassive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23147v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sulfur monoxide as a tracer of the Galactic $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S gradient</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yipeng Zou, Jiangshui Zhang, Dingyuan Wei, Yaoting Yan, Donatella Romano, Youxin Wang, Jialiang Chen, Hongzhi Yu, Jieyu Zhao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables + Appendices.

As another abundant S-bearing molecules, SO and its isotopomer $^{34}$SO could be considered as tracers of the $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratio. We present the first systematic observations of SO and $^{34}$SO toward a large sample of molecular clouds with accurate distances, performed with the IRAM 30 m and the 10 m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the IRAM 30 m, SO $2_2-1_1$ was detected in 59 of 82 sources ($\sim$82%), and $^{34}$SO $2_2-1_1$ in 8 sources ($\sim$10%). With the SMT 10 m, SO $5_5-4_4$ was detected in 136 of 184 sources ($\sim$74%), and $^{34}$SO $5_5-4_4$ in 55 of 77 strong SO sources ($\sim$72%). SO/$^{34}$SO ratios were derived for 8 ($2_2-1_1$) and 55 ($5_5-4_4$) sources. No correlation was found between the SO/$^{34}$SO ratio and heliocentric distance or $T_k$, suggesting negligible distance and fractionation effects. Both LTE and non-LTE analyses consistently suggest that the optical depth effect is also insignificant. $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from the $2_2-1_1$ transitions follow the increasing radial trend proposed by previous CS species measurements, while those from the $5_5-4_4$ lines are systematically lower. The lower transitions of SO and $^{34}$SO may be suitable tracers of $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S, though the detections are rare. Comparisons between measurements and Galactic chemical evolution model suggest that the nucleosynthesis prescriptions need to be revised in the low-metallicity regime, but more data for the outermost Galactic regions are crucial for drawing strong conclusions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23106v1" target="_blank"><h2>Consequences of radially correlated rotation curves for galaxy mass models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Helena Chase, Diego Dado, Katherine E.

We apply the data-driven approach proposed by Posti (2022) to include the characteristic amplitude and scale length of such correlations as `nuisance parameters'. We construct mass models for $134$ galaxies from the SPARC rotation curve compilation with Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and pseudo-isothermal sphere (pISO) models for the dark halo. Allowing for correlations in the rotation curves generally improves the goodness of fit for both halo models, often yielding a formally good fit ($χ^2_\mathrm{r}\approx 1$) and model uncertainties that seem more representative of the constraining power of the data. For both halo models the inference on the typical correlation amplitude and scale length are very similar and physically plausible, $\sim 20\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\sim 5\,\mathrm{kpc}$, respectively. The parametric form that we use to describe the correlations is intentionally simple, and our fitting approach makes the parameters describing possible correlations prone to `absorbing' other systematic errors, so we regard these estimates as upper limits. Without allowing for correlations we find a statistical preference for the pISO over the NFW model for $88$/$134$ galaxies; this preference essentially disappears when correlations are allowed for. Accounting for correlations in rotation curves when constructing mass models fundamentally affects how they are interpreted, highlighting an important systematic uncertainty that affects evidence for cusps or cores in dark matter haloes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23073v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining dark matter halo profiles with symbolic regression</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alicia Martín, Tariq Yasin, Deaglan J.

However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23040v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-resolution cosmological simulations of primordial dark matter clustering under long-range and fractional forces</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Derek Inman<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 19 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Long-range attractive fifth forces can lead to exponential instabilities in the early Universe.

We study cosmological systems evolving under both this fractional potential and the Newtonian potential using high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that, at the same mass scale, halos that form under the fractional potential are much more dense than those that from the Newtonian potential. However, we also find that the perturbed scalar field may have large fluctuations once halo sizes become comparable to an effective Compton length, which will modify subsequent clustering and collapse.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22987v1" target="_blank"><h2>Incorporating neutron star physics into gravitational wave inference with neural priors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Thibeau Wouters, Peter T.

However, to investigate neutron star mergers, priors are often chosen in an agnostic way, leaving valuable information from nuclear physics and independent observations of neutron stars unused. In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors. Our method paves the way for classifying future ambiguous low-mass mergers observed through gravitational waves and for continuously incorporating advances in our understanding of neutron star properties into gravitational-wave data analysis.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22949v1" target="_blank"><h2>Collapse of Axion Domain Wall Induced by Helical Primordial Magnetic Fields</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zizhuo Zhao, Yuefeng Di, Ligong Bian, Jing Shu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-lat, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages + 9 pages, 14 figures, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stable domain wall (DW) must decay to avoid overclose the Universe.

We present a hybrid machine-learning (ML) framework that integrates field-level inference (FLI) with simulation-based inference (SBI) to map observed shear fields directly to cosmological parameters, eliminating the need for convergence reconstruction. The FLI network extracts rich non-Gaussian information from the shear field to produce informative features, which are then used by SBI to model the resulting complex posteriors. To mitigate noise from intrinsic galaxy shapes, we develop a blind, training-free, PCA-based shear denoising method. Tests on CSST-like mock catalogs reveal significant performance gains. The shear-based inference achieves approximately twice the cosmological constraining power in Figure of Merit (FoM) compared to the conventional convergence-based approach. Moreover, the combination of PCA denoising and ML compression can deliver a 36.4% improvement in FoM over standard shear two-point statistics. This work establishes a scalable and robust pathway for cosmological inference, unlocking the full potential of Stage-IV weak-lensing surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22798v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inflation, black holes with primary hair, and regular planar black holes from an infinite tower of regularized Lovelock-Proca corrections</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pedro G.

Cross-correlating these surveys can constrain the redshift distribution of radio sources, mitigate systematic effects, and place constraints on cosmological models. We perform the first measurement of the clustering cross-spectrum between radio-continuum sources in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey and galaxies from the ESA Euclid satellite mission's Q1 release. Our goal is to detect and characterise the cross-correlation signal, test its robustness against systematic effects, and compare our measurements with theoretical predictions. We use data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder's EMU Main Survey, which overlaps with the Euclid Deep Field South. We generate two radio-source catalogues using different source finders to create galaxy maps. We measure the harmonic-space cross-correlation signal using a pseudo-spectrum estimator. The measured signal is compared to theoretical predictions based on a ΛCDM cosmology, using several models for the EMU source redshift distribution and bias. We report detection above 8σ of the cross-correlation signal consistent across all tested models and data sets. The measured cross-spectra from the two radio catalogues are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that the cross-correlation is robust against the choice of source-finding algorithm. The measured signal also agrees with theoretical models developed from previous cross-correlation studies and simulations. This pathfinder study establishes a statistically significant cross-correlation between EMU and Euclid. The robustness of the signal is a crucial validation of the methodology, paving the way for future large-scale analyses leveraging the full power of this synergy to constrain cosmological parameters and our understanding of galaxy evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22670v1" target="_blank"><h2>Vortex Dynamics in the Neutron Star Inner Crust</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xin Sheng, Bennett Link, Matthew E.

We demonstrate the pinning of an initially moving vortex to the lattice through excitation of lattice vibrations, and show that the efficiency of this process is higher for attractive than for repulsive nucleus-vortex interactions. We explore the unpinning of a vortex under the action of the applied Magnus force, and find that it is influenced by multiple parameters, including the sign of the pinning force, the lattice orientation, composition, temperature, and the energy of pinning to individual nucleus. In lattices with multiple grains, the unpinning transition is triggered inside the grains with weaker pinning, propagates along the vortex (mediated by the excited Kelvin waves) and crosses into grains with stronger pinning. This is likely to effectively decrease the critical force at which vortices unpin and to produce extended regions of unpinned vorticity. Shearing of the crust lattice (e.g., by a starquake) initiates the unpinning of the vortices that are crossing the slip plane. A close encounter of an unpinned vortex with a pinned vortex would cause the latter to unpin, perhaps initiating an unpinning avalanche of many vortices.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22661v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing Structure: Shape and Centroid Deviations in 39 Strong Lensing Clusters as a Test of Cluster Formation Predictions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Raven Gassis, Matthew B.

Specifically, the relative alignments of the dark matter (DM) halo, stars, and hot intracluster gas in these clusters offer insights into how well theoretical structure predictions hold. We measure the position angles, ellipticities, and locations/centroids of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), the Intracluster Light (ICL), the hot Intracluster Medium (ICM), and the Core Lensing Mass (CLM) for a sample of strong lensing galaxy clusters from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). We measure the shapes (position angles and ellipticities) and centroids of these distributions using ellipse-fitting methods applied to different datasets: HST WFC3 imaging for the BCG and ICL, Chandra X-ray observations for the ICM, and strong-lensing mass reconstructions for the CLM. Additionally, we incorporate ICM morphological measures to classify the dynamical state of the cluster sample. Using this multi-component approach, we constrain the shape and centroids of these distributions in this sample and evaluate the different observable components in terms of their ability to trace the gravitational potential of their respective clusters. We find that misalignments between cluster components can be explained by astrophysical processes related to cluster assembly, relaxation, and merger histories. We find that the ICL is most closely aligned with its host DM halo, as traced by the CLM distribution, in both position angle and centroid. Additionally, we find that on average the ICL and CLM are more elliptical than the ICM and BCG.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22641v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-Gaussianity in SMICA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

We test our method on 400 E and B polarization simulations based on the LiteBIRD experiment, containing the two main sources of contamination for CMB polarization experiments: polarized dust and synchrotron emission.

While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (>1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22596v1" target="_blank"><h2>Skew-spectra: a generalization to spin-$s$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alexander Roskill, Sara Maleubre, David Alonso, Pedro G.

We apply the formalism to weak lensing in the context of large scale structure, and discuss different ways of combining fields to build skew-spectra, all while avoiding the problems associated with mass-mapping. We provide plots of these new statistics for $Λ$CDM and vary cosmological parameters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22575v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forecasting Constraint on Primordial Black Hole Properties with the CSST $3\times2$pt Analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dingao Hu, Yan Gong, Pengfei Su, Hengjie Lin, Haitao Miao, Qi Xiong, Xuelei Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 10 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This study forecasts the constraints on the properties of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a cold dark matter component using the galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing (i.e. $3\times2$pt) measurements from the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Since PBHs formed via gravitational collapse in the early Universe, they can additionally affect the formation and evolution of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) through the ``Poisson" effect. We compute the angular power spectra for PBH-$Λ$CDM cosmology, and generate mock data based on the CSST instrumental and survey design. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the free parameters, such as the product of the PBH fraction and mass $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$ and other cosmological parameters. The systematic parameters are also included in the fitting process, such as the parameters of the baryonic effect, intrinsic alignment, galaxy bias, photometric redshift (photo-$z$) calibration, shear calibration, and noise terms. We find that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis can achieve tight constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$, with 68% and 95% confidence levels (CLs) reaching $<10^{3.9} M_{\odot}$ and $<10^{4.7} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Additionally, the cosmological parameters, e.g. $Ω_m$, $σ_8$ and $w$, can be constrained with the precisions of 3.3%, 1.7%, 13%, respectively. This indicates that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis is a powerful tool to advance the PBH dark matter studies in the near future.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22574v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMACAL.

These faint sources are critical for refining evolutionary models, as their number counts provide key constraints. In this study, we analyzed band-3 ALMACAL maps from 606 calibrator fields, employing a novel machine learning approach to mitigate the often-overlooked bias introduced by the calibrator itself. Supported by extensive simulations, we extended 100 GHz radio AGN counts by approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude in flux density and refined constraints on dusty star-forming galaxies, reaching sensitivities as low as $\sim$180 $μ$Jy. We have improved the sampling, compared to previous results, in the region of the dominant population transition (between dusty star-forming galaxies and radio AGN). Our results are in good agreement with model predictions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22573v1" target="_blank"><h2>The network analysis of the cosmic web as a tool to constrain cosmology and cosmic magnetism</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anton Rudakovskyi, Franco Vazza, Maksym Tsizh<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 14 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title), AGN (title, abstract), halo (abstract), haloes (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context. The spatial distribution of haloes in the Cosmic Web encodes a wealth of information about the underlying cosmological model. These haloes can be represented as nodes of a graph, whose structural properties reflect cosmological parameters. Aims. Using our new MAKITRA suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations covering a total volume of $(300\,\text{Mpc})^3$ and with 21 physical model variations (including variations of $σ_8$ and of different models of primordial magnetic fields, PMFs), we investigate the sensitivity of network-based statistics describing the Cosmic Web to variations in cosmological and PMF scenarios. Methods. We focus on several complementary metrics that characterise the spatial distribution of dark and baryonic matter haloes: two-point correlation functions, network-centrality statistics, and counts-in-cell measurements. We first compare the halo-halo correlation functions across different cosmological models. For the network analysis, we represent haloes as vertices of the Cosmic Web and compute multiple centrality measures, whose cumulative distributions we evaluate for universes with varying PMF strengths. Finally, we quantify halo abundances within randomly placed spheres of fixed radius to assess differences between scenarios. Results. First, we find that the statistics of the centralities of the network can serve as a novel sensitive probe of the cosmological parameter $σ_8$. Moreover, we find that this network analysis approach can allow us to distinguish the presence of PMFs with initial strength $\approx\,4 \text{nG}$ from the scenarios with much weaker PMFs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22559v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmology of axion dark energy in supersymmetric models and constraints on high scale parameters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Amin Aboubrahim, Andrew H.

The case $N=2$ is investigated in detail and a fit to cosmological data is performed where it is found that a better fit is obtained in comparison with the $N=1$ case. The fits also constrain high scale parameters, i.e., the axion decay constant which is determined to be sub-Planckian, a result consistent with string theory that disfavors trans-Planckian axion decay constant. Furthermore, the dark energy-dark matter interaction strength is constrained to be feeble, i.e., $λ\lesssim 4\times 10^{-6}$ m$_{\rm Pl}^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-2}$. We study possible implications of this type of potential on the Hubble tension and on the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state using the DESI-DR2 data. For the cases $N=3,4$, the analysis exhibits the phenomenon of transmutation even in the absence of coupling to dark matter, where thawing quintessence transmutes to freezing quintessence. The analysis is internally consistent in its treatment of the dark energy-dark matter interaction as it is based on an underlying Lagrangian, in contrast with several previous works where the sources are chosen in an ad hoc manner to satisfy energy conservation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22534v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards Understanding the Origin of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts Driven by Magnetars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> C.

Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $γ$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{γ,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22520v1" target="_blank"><h2>Needle in a Poissonian haystack -- An X-ray astronomer's guide to QPE fishing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> E.

As such, observing strategies are adapting, with a current trend focusing on late-time X-ray follow-ups of (optical) TDEs. While these campaigns are so far proving quite successful, the inherent confirmation bias they introduce in our sample could lead the community to hasty, and perhaps erroneous, conclusions. It is thus important to still pursue the search for nuclear transients in other, more agnostic directions. In this work, we focus on the observational aspects of our field, and lay out two different methods that can be deployed in order to reveal new QPE sources. These complementary methods enable the detection of long-term ($\sim$years) and short term ($\sim$minutes) transient events, that would have otherwise been missed by the standard detection pipelines. Both of these methods can be used either for data mining in the 25 years worth of XMM-Newton archive, or to trigger real-time follow-ups upon a more recent discovery.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22512v1" target="_blank"><h2>Robust evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and joint ACT, SPT, and Planck data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Sheng-Han Zhou, Yun-He Li, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest a significant preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) that exhibits the phantom-like behavior in the past and has transitioned into quintessence-like behavior today. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $Λ$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2σ$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $Λ$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $Λ$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22478v1" target="_blank"><h2>Clustering in dynamical dark energy: observational constraints from DESI, CMB, and supernovae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuhang Yang, Qingqing Wang, Xin Ren, Emmanuel N.

We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $Λ$CDM reaches $3.42σ$, rising to $3.63σ$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19σ$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $Λ$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22468v1" target="_blank"><h2>Differentiable N-body code for Galactic Dynamics -- Odisseo</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Giuseppe Viterbo, Tobias Buck<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce \textsc{Odisseo} (Optimized Differentiable Integrator for Stellar Systems Evolution of Orbits), a differentiable N-body code designed to constrain the gravitational potential of the Milky Way (MW) through dynamical modeling of accreted structures such as stellar streams. \textsc{Odisseo} is implemented in JAX, enabling just-in-time compilation, automatic differentiation, and hardware acceleration on GPUs and TPUs.

Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22453v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA): The Properties of Quasar Host Galaxies: Star Formation Histories and Stellar Populations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Maria B.

We find that quasar host galaxies tend to be star-forming galaxies ($\sim$ 80%) lying on the star-forming MS; the fraction of quasar host galaxies that are quiescent ($\sim$ 20%) is lower than the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the comparison sample of normal galaxies (54%). We find that the mean star formation rate of quasar host galaxies has increased over the past 100 Myr by a factor of 2--3, but these galaxies were star-forming at all times previously. Our data are more consistent with quasar activity originating together with an increase in the star formation rate of otherwise normal galaxies, similar to episodic star formation in normal spirals.

This study provides a proof of concept for extracting the spatially resolved SFHs of local galaxies with Euclid, highlighting the strengths and limitations of SFH modeling in the context of next-generation galaxy surveys. We used the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector to model both spatially resolved and global SFHs using parametric and nonparametric configurations. The input consisted of mock ultraviolet--near-infrared photometry derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation and processed with the radiative transfer code SKIRT. We show that nonparametric SFHs provide a more effective approach to mitigating the outshining effect by recent star formation, offering improved accuracy in the determination of galaxy stellar properties. Also, we find that the nonparametric SFH model at resolved scales closely recovers the stellar mass formation times (within 0.1~dex) and the ground truth values from TNG50, with an absolute average bias of $0.03$~dex in stellar mass and $0.01$~dex in both specific star formation rate and mass-weighted age. In contrast, larger offsets are estimated for all stellar properties and formation times when using a simple $τ$-model SFH, at both resolved and global scales, highlighting its limitations. These results emphasize the critical role of nonparametric SFHs in both global and spatially resolved analyses, as they better capture the complex evolutionary pathways of galaxies and avoid the biases inherent in simple parametric models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22356v1" target="_blank"><h2>Net Charge Accretion in Magnetized Kerr Black Holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ethan Berreby, Avner Okun, Shahar Hadar, Amos Ori<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal "saturation charge" $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the "attracted" charge exceeds the upper bound for the "repelled" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22319v1" target="_blank"><h2>The life of central radio galaxies in clusters: AGN-ICM studies of eRASS1 clusters in the ASKAP fields</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Angie Veronica, Thomas H.

We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{X},~r<R_\mathrm{cool}}\approx 5.50\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22276v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kerr black holes as circular polarizers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> De-Chang Dai<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the retrograde second caustics of extremal Kerr black holes, where the intensity of the light beam is infinitely magnified.

A lensing black hole at several lys away separates the polarized beams about $10^{12}$m apart. This splitting is larger than the radius of the Earth.

Cross-correlating high-redshift tracer samples with the CMB lensing potential offers a particularly robust probe of PNGs, mitigating imaging systematics that typically affect large-scale measurements from tracer auto-spectra. In this context, UNIONS enables the selection of $u$-dropout high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). We perform a MCMC-based forecast to estimate the uncertainties on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and on a galaxy bias parameter, which captures our uncertainty in the tracer bias. From the angular cross-power spectrum between LBGs and Planck CMB lensing, we forecast $σ(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=34$ for an idealized photometric sample of $r<24.3$ LBGs selected with a Random Forest classification algorithm from UNIONS-like $ugriz$ imaging, with a resulting surface density of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$. This precision can be improved to $σ(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=20$ after spectroscopic follow-up with DESI, during its next phase starting in 2029, DESI-II. We test a more realistic $u$-dropout LBG selection using early UNIONS data, which yields a denser sample of $r<24.2$ objects at $1,400$ deg$^{-2}$. From this sample, covering a larger footprint and expected to have a higher large-scale galaxy bias, we forecast $σ(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=20$, with similar precision achievable after DESI spectroscopic follow-up. In addition, we perform preliminary validation of the redshift distribution using the clustering-redshift method with DESI DR1 data, confirming the calibration from deep, small-area photometric fields. However, accounting for uncertainties in the clustering-redshift distribution significantly degrades the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ constraining power.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22220v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing CMB Polarization Gaussianity with the Statistics of Unpolarized Points: Non-Gaussianity of Planck Data and Prospects for Future B-Mode Measurements</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> K.

This classification of singular points where both Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ vanish stems from the fact that linear polarization is described by a second-rank tensor. By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing.

In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetar with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here, $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar, but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equation of states. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22124v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deep insights into Abell 2163: unveiling the treasure trove of ICM plasma physics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ramananda Santra, Ruta Kale, Simona Giacintucci, Herve Bourdin, Rashi Jain, Andrea Botteon, Gianfranco Brunetti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages (total), 33 figures, 8 tables, 3 appendix (6 figures).

We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22071v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Catalogue of Mid-infrared Variable Sources from unTimely</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zihan kang, Jingyi Zhang, Yanxia Zhang, Changhua Li, Xiao Kong, Minzhi Kong, Jinghang Shi, Shirui Wei, Xue-Bing Wu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), time-domain (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The WISE and NEOWISE missions have provided the only mid-infrared all-sky time-domain data, opening a unique observational window for variability studies.

In this work, we construct the first large-scale mid-infrared variability catalog based on the unTimely coadded photometry, covering tens of millions of sources. By employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with a Dirichlet process, we identified 8,256,042 variable sources in the W1 band and 7,147,661 in the W2 band, significantly expanding the landscape of known mid-infrared variables. In addition to robust variability metrics, our analysis highlights rare and extreme outliers through dedicated outlier-detection algorithms, enabling the discovery of unusual classes of objects such as eruptive young stellar objects, highly variable active galactic nuclei, and other rare transients. This unprecedented dataset provides a new foundation for time-domain astronomy in the mid-infrared, offering complementary insights to optical and near-infrared surveys, and opening the door to systematic investigations of stellar evolution, accretion processes, and dust-enshrouded astrophysical environments on a Galactic and extragalactic scale.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21995v1" target="_blank"><h2>QCD axions and domain walls in dense matter under compact stellar conditions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhen-Yan Lu, Shu-Peng Wang, Qi Lu, Bo-Nan Zhang, Marco Ruggieri<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.HE, nucl-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), LLS (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In compact stellar environments, the stability of dense QCD matter requires the simultaneous fulfillment of charge neutrality and beta equilibrium. In this work, we study how temperature and finite chemical potential affect QCD topology and axion properties within this medium, analyzing both cases with and without the charge neutrality condition. Our results show that the topological susceptibility and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition in both cases. In particular, the axion mass is strongly suppressed near the transition, while the axion self-coupling constant develops a pronounced peak whose magnitude depends on the temperature and density of the medium. Remarkably, around the critical point at $T\simeq70$ MeV and $μ\simeq346$ MeV, the self-coupling constant is enhanced by more than a factor of seven compared to its vacuum value, a feature that to the best of our knowledge has not been reported in previous studies. Such a strong amplification at the phase boundary indicates that axion-mediated interactions could play an important role in shaping the structure and stability of compact stars, with potential implications for their evolution and observable astrophysical signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21991v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical implementation of flat FLRW models of cosmic expansion with Planck 2018 cosmological parameters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Julio Carlos Bertua Marasca, Homer Davila Gutierrez, Oswaldo Alberto Martinez Osorio, Josue Ismael Mosquera Hadatty, Renato Cristian Videla Ricci<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 2 figures, 1 appendix with Python code; intended as a computational and pedagogical project for undergraduate/graduate cosmology courses; submitted to European Journal of Physics<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an explicit numerical implementation of the Friedmann equations to model the expansion of the Universe in spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies.

A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks.

Dust temperatures ($T_{d}$) are determined based on the corresponding galaxy dust masses, independently calculated in our previous work, through a self-consistent method, without the need to actually perform a complete spectral energy distribution (SED) fit of the cold dust emission fluxes. The range and average dust temperatures are found to be consistent within errors with values from other studies. Simultaneously, the dust emissivity indices ($β_{d}$) are determined, and their evolution with temperature quantified, with the $T_{d}$ anti-correlation still being present. It is investigated whether $β_{d}$ can be predicted from other relation or if it scales with other integrated dust / ISM or galaxy property, which could be used as a proxy. In this respect, new and established relations between $T_{d}$, $β_{d}$, the dust surface density and global / integrated galaxy and star-formation related quantities are presented and analysed. We find that SFR, sSFR or $Σ_{SFR}$ are inconclusive traces of the dust temperature. We also find that the extent of dust emission distribution is slightly lower on average, but comparable with the optical stellar continuum emission one. The results and conclusions can be relevant for larger scales studies of low to mid-redshift galaxies from the latest surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21921v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Galaxy Formation in Cosmological Simulations with CRK-HACC</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nicholas Frontiere, J.

The advent of exascale computing now enables a new generation of simulations that couple these physical processes across full-sky volumes with excellent statistical sampling of large-scale structure tracers such as galaxies, groups, and clusters. To support these efforts, we extend the CRK-HACC framework, a GPU-accelerated cosmological hydrodynamics code, with a suite of astrophysical subgrid models that simulate radiative cooling, star formation, stellar evolution, and AGN feedback within a numerically robust formulation optimized for scalability on modern exascale architectures. The models were selected and calibrated to reproduce observed galaxy stellar mass functions over the redshift range $0 < z < 2$ and cluster populations probed by cosmological surveys, capturing the large-scale baryonic evolution relevant for multi-wavelength, cross-correlated analyses.

Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21881v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in CAMELS simulations and the significant impact of baryon model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daniel Bilsborrow, Niall Jeffrey<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 12 figures, preprint for submission in MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), quiescent galaxies (abstract), ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract), AGN feedback (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a detection of the intrinsic galaxy alignments in the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the alignment amplitude depends significantly on cosmological and supernova feedback parameters - specifically $Ω_m$, $σ_8$, $A_{\text{SN1}}$, $A_{\text{SN2}}$- while no dependence on AGN feedback is observed (due to the limited simulation volume $(25\,h^{-1}\,\text{Mpc})^3$). The dependence on $σ_8$ vanishes when projected correlation functions $w_{m+}$ are normalized by matter density correlations $w_{mm}$, consistent with predictions from linear alignment models. We find alignment amplitudes in quiescent galaxies to exceed those in star-forming galaxies by an order of magnitude. Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples. Finally, we find evidence that supernova feedback impacts alignment signals differently in star-forming versus quiescent populations, suggesting that distinct alignment mechanisms operate across galaxy types.

Star formation begins early ($z\gtrsim8$) in progenitors with $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^5$-$10^6 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, where molecular hydrogen enables warm moderate-density gas to efficiently cool. The LWB strongly influences the $z=0$ halo occupation fraction, shifting the dark-to-luminous transition from $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^7 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (weaker LWB) to $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^8 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (stronger LWB). Galaxies with $M_\ast\gtrsim10^5 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are mostly insensitive to the LWB choice, whereas lower mass systems respond strongly, producing markedly different stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations. The weaker LWB yields a very shallow SMHM slope with nearly constant scatter, while the stronger LWB introduces a pronounced break at $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^9 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, where haloes of similar mass host galaxies with $M_\ast\sim10^3$ to $10^5 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ or remain dark. Both models produce a minimum stellar mass floor at $M_\ast\sim10^3 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, originating from galaxies that undergo a single burst of star formation at high redshift before self-quenching from their first supernovae.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21823v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Exotic Astrophysical Dark objects through Astrometric Microlensing from Gaia</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lalit Singh Bhandari, Vikram Rentala, Arun M.

We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \sim 1-10~M_\odot$ and $R \lesssim 10~\text{AU}$. In the absence of anomalous detections, Gaia can set powerful 90% confidence level constraints on the fractional abundance of these exotic objects, reaching $f_{\mathrm{DM}} \le 10^{-3}$ in the peak region which covers masses from $10^{-1}-10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and radii $R<10^{6}~\text{AU}$. Crucially, these projected astrometric microlensing constraints are significantly stronger than existing photometric microlensing limits in the $1-10~M_\odot$ mass range. This work establishes astrometric microlensing with Gaia as a powerful, complementary, and near-future probe with the potential to discover exotic astrophysical dark objects.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21822v1" target="_blank"><h2>J-PAS: A value-added catalogue of optical line intensities for nebular emission galaxies (JOLINES)</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

This catalogue will be updated with future data releases, offering a growing resource for the study of emission-line galaxies. To obtain reliable emission-line fluxes from narrow-band photometry, we employed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using CIGALE, a robust tool that reconstructs the continuum emission and ensures accurate flux measurements. This method effectively mitigates uncertainties associated with direct continuum subtraction techniques, and systematics such as absorption components in the emission lines. We validate our approach using simulated observations of galaxy spectra with added noise, testing the method's performance across different equivalent width (EW) regimes and emission-line strengths. Additionally, we compare the recovered emission-line fluxes with spectroscopic measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our results show a tight correlation between photometric and spectroscopic fluxes, particularly for bright emission lines, with a typical dispersion of $\sim$0.3 dex. Reliable fluxes are obtained for emission lines with EW $\gtrsim20\, \rm{\mathring{A}}$, in agreement with previous empirical studies. The current catalogue comprises approximately 13,900 sources with reliable flux measurements in the H$α$+[NII] complex and 7,200 in [OIII]$λ5007$, ensuring statistically robust samples for the brightest optical emission lines. This resource will be expanded in future J-PAS releases, facilitating large-scale studies of star formation, AGN activity, and galaxy evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21820v1" target="_blank"><h2>Little Red Dots host Black Hole Stars: A unified family of gas-reddened AGN revealed by JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anna de Graaff, Raphael E.

We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~$0.4-1.0μ$m, with typical T~5000K or $λ_{peak}$~$0.65μ$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $λ_{peak}<0.65μ$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $β_{UV}$ and $L_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $Hα,\ Hβ$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$α$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$α$ and OI$_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L_{Hα}$, $L_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21818v1" target="_blank"><h2>The impact of magnetic fields during tidal disruption events</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Simona Pacuraru, Clément Bonnerot, Martin E.

As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\sim 10^4\,\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21813v1" target="_blank"><h2>APEX survey of interstellar HCl: $^{35}$Cl/$^{37}$Cl isotopic ratios in dense cores and outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lennart M.

Further, the $^{35}\text{Cl}/ ^{37}$Cl ratio probes nucleosynthesis across the Galaxy. Yet, studies of Cl-bearing molecules have remained limited to a few sightlines due to observational challenges.
  We systematically investigated the Galactic distribution of HCl and the [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] ratio in high-mass star-forming regions. As a probe of a region's nucleosynthesis history, this ratio may constrain predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models.
  We observed the ground-state $J=1$$-$0 lines of H$^{35}$Cl and H$^{37}$Cl toward 28 high-mass star-forming regions with SEPIA660 on APEX, more than doubling the number of known HCl detections and revealing with XCLASS models emission from both cores and outflows.
  H$^{35}$Cl was detected in all sources, H$^{37}$Cl in all but two, with spectral line profiles ranging from those with only emission to complex emission-absorption mixtures. We find column densities of the order of $10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$^{35}$Cl and isotopic ratios between $1.6$ and $3.5$ in emission-only sources.
  The derived [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] aligns with Galactic chemical evolution models and shows no trend with Galactocentric radius. However, local variations may reflect recent nucleosynthesis. Overall, the results suggest that most Galactic chlorine was synthesized during epochs of lower average metallicity in the Galaxy. Notably, we detect H$^{35}$Cl emission arising from outflows - particularly explosive ones - hinting at its presence in a broader range of environments. The present single-dish observations cannot reveal the origin of HCl in outflows; necessitating interferometric follow-up observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21814v1" target="_blank"><h2>Statistical Properties of Cold Streams In Massive Star-Forming Halos in IllustrisTNG-50</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Isabel Medlock, Daisuke Nagai, Nir Mandelker, Volker Springel, Frank C. van den Bosch, Elad Zinger, Barry T.

We investigate the prevalence of such cold streams in IllustrisTNG-50 over the range z=4-0, using a novel algorithm to automatically detect cold streams in simulated halos. We qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the geometric and physical properties of the detected streams over cosmic time. We find that cold streams are ubiquitous in massive halos at cosmic noon, occurring in more than 80 percent of such systems down to z=1, before becoming rare by z=0. At their peak prevalence (z=2-1), streams are often found in roughly co-planar, three-stream configurations. These streams generally exhibit a dense and cool core, surrounded by a diffuse and warmer envelope. However, we find that in IllustrisTNG-50, these streams typically disrupt in the outer halo and do not penetrate efficiently to the central galaxy, with the total mass inflow from streams peaking at z=2. Our results underscore the importance of cold streams in fueling galaxies at early times, but they highlight the need for higher-resolution simulations to fully capture their survival and impact at later epochs. Future cosmological zoom-in simulations, with better resolution in the CGM, will be essential to resolve turbulent mixing layers and feedback-inflow interactions that determine whether cold streams can reach the galactic disk.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21816v1" target="_blank"><h2>The LMT 2 Millimeter Receiver System (B4R).

The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identification of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, complementing the existing 3 mm Redshift Search Receiver by enabling the detection of multiple carbon monoxide lines. Additionally, the B4R receiver broadens the range of science cases possible with the LMT, including astrochemistry, as the 2 mm band encompasses unique molecular lines such as deuterated molecules and shock tracers. During on-site commissioning in 2018 and 2019, we successfully demonstrated on-the-fly mapping and position-switching observations toward the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 and bright high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, respectively. We confirmed that the installed B4R system largely met its basic performance specifications. Furthermore, we measured the LMT's aperture efficiencies across the entire B4R frequency range (130-160 GHz), finding them to be roughly consistent with expectations based on a surface accuracy of 100 $μ$m and the receiver optics design. These results with the B4R will enable the most sensitive single-dish spectroscopic observations at 2 mm using the LMT.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21805v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effects of Resolution and Local Stability on Galactic Disks: I.

We explore how numerical resolution, the level of local disk stability, and the presence of a live halo influence both the initial appearance and the subsequent evolution of these modes. To characterize spiral structure, we compute Fourier amplitudes for modes $m=1$-$6$. In marginally unstable, lower-resolution disks ($N_\star=5\times10^6$, $N_{\rm DM}=1.14\times10^7$), faint features appear within the first $0.5$ Gyr due to numerical noise, in contrast to high-resolution models where perturbations emerge later. Across all sufficiently resolved, live-halo models with $m_{\rm DM}/m_\star \le 10$, the spirals exhibit a cascading sequence in both mode number and radius: higher-$m$ modes form and decay first, followed by the delayed emergence of lower-$m$ modes, with an inward drift of the activity's epicenter. This behavior reflects a combination of local swing amplification, which explains the initial growth of short-wavelength modes, and interference between coexisting long-lived spiral modes, which accounts for the recurrent short-timescale amplitude modulations. In contrast, models with a fixed halo potential or coarse halo resolution ($N_{\rm DM}=1.14\times10^6$ and $m_{\rm DM}/m_\star=100$) show strong early spirals but lack this coherent cascading behavior, owing to excessive shot noise and insufficient halo responsiveness. The $m=3$ mode plays a transitional role, marking the onset of angular-momentum transport in the inner disk that precedes bar formation, a process absent in fixed-potential models. Our results show that a live halo with appropriate mass resolution provides the gravitational response needed to sustain and regenerate multi-mode spiral structure, even though the total angular-momentum exchange remains small.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21634v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological Probes of Lepton Parity Freeze-in Dark Matter: $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ & Gravitational Waves <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ernest Ma, Partha Kumar Paul, Narendra Sahu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 14 captioned figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, a residual symmetry known as lepton parity: $(-1)^L$, remains preserved. Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $σ$ allows for the coupling $N S σ$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\rightarrow Sσ$), and (ii) for $T_{\rm EW}<T_{\rm rh}\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $σ-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\langleσ\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $σ-h$ coupling is small, then $σ$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($σ\rightarrow Sν$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21627v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence For A Correlation Between Astrophysical Neutrinos and Radio Flares <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yjan A.

We obtained a map of the OI line at 63 micron with 6" angular resolution and employed archival data of the CII 158 micron line (14" resolution), using the upGREAT heterodyne receiver aboard SOFIA. We also collected IRAM 30m CO data at 1mm (11" resolution). All the lines were detected across the whole object. The peak integrated OI emission of ~5 K km/s is located ~10" west of an embedded YSO. The OI and CII data near the source show bulk emission at ~11 km/s and a line wing at ~13 km/s, while the 12CO 2-1 data reveal additional blue-shifted high-velocity emission. The KOSMA-tau PDR model can explain the emissions in the tail with a low external UV field (<350 Go, mostly consistent with our UV field estimates), but not at the location of the YSO. There, the high line intensities and increased line widths for all lines and a possible bipolar CO outflow suggest the presence of a protostellar disc. However, the existence of a thermal HII region, revealed by combining existing and new radio continuum data, points towards a massive star - and not a T Tauri-type one. We derived molecular and atomic gas masses of ~20 Msun and a few Msun, respectively. The photo-evaporation (only considering external illumination) lifetime of 1.6x10^5 yrs is shorter than the free-fall lifetime of 5.2x10^5 yrs; thus, we find that proplyd #7 might not have had the time to produce many more stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21618v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Super-Eddington, Lensing-Magnified Quasar at $z=5.07$ observed with JWST <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Katherine Panebianco, Minghao Yue, Anna-Christina Eilers, Xiaohui Fan, Feige Wang, Jinyi Yang, Robert A.

Exploiting the sharp PSF of the F070W band, we confirm that the background quasar can be well-described by a single point spread function (PSF), essentially ruling out the existence of multiple lensed images. We do not detect the quasar host galaxy in either the F070W or the F480M band. Using the HST and JWST photometry, we fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the foreground galaxy.

To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\langle n(r) \rangle \propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \sim 400$~\text{Mpc}/$h$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21567v1" target="_blank"><h2>Enhanced antineutrino emission from $β$ decay in core-collapse supernovae with self-consistent weak decay rates <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> T.

Despite their importance, most studies to date on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have focused primarily on the effects of electron captures, generally neglecting $β$ decay contributions. In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $β$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $β$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $β$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21512v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime.

However, observational measurements of this `burst mass fraction' are scant. Here, we assemble a large (~14,000) sample of post-coalescence galaxies that have recently completed their merger-induced star formation, and compare various measurements of central stellar mass with a matched control sample. Specifically, we quantify (at fixed redshift, star formation rate and total stellar mass) the stellar mass enhancement within a fixed angular aperture (Delta M_{star,fibre}) and in the galactic bulge (Delta M_{star,bulge}), finding burst mass fractions of 10 -- 20 %. 61 galaxies in our sample are at z<0.05 and have integral field unit data from the Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) survey, allowing further kpc-scale assessment of excess stellar mass and radial gradients. Again, we find a ~15 -- 20 % excess of stellar mass in the central regions of the post-mergers compared with matched controls. However, contrary to previous works, which have inferred very compact, centralized merger-induced mass growth, we find a 15 % stellar mass excess out to ~7 kpc (1.4 R_e for the stellar masses in our sample). Our work represents the first direct measurement of merger-induced stellar mass that is independent of stellar population modelling, or fitting light profiles, demonstrating significant and extended mass build-up in late stage post-mergers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21501v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Feasibility of Using Fe XXIII Metastable Transitions as a Density Diagnostic for LMXB Disk Winds <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> D.

Studying these outflows can inform the understanding of the geometry of the systems, as well as the dynamics and energetics of accretion. One key variable for determining the location of these disk winds is the density of the outflowing material. In this paper we explore a density diagnostic based upon the absorption of ionizing photons by density-sensitive metastable states of Fe XXIII. This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX~13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission. For each of these, we find that the regime where Fe XXIII can be used as a density diagnostic is with an ionization parameter $\log{(ξ/{\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})}\sim2-3$ and an outflow density $\log{(n_H/{\rm cm^{-3})}}\gtrsim14$. The typical range of ionization parameters for LMXBs indicates that this technique is more feasibly achieved with BH LMXBs than their NS counterparts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21499v1" target="_blank"><h2>The relativistic tidal tensor: general solutions for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes and the Hills mass of naked singularities <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Wenkang Xin, Andrew Mummery<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 7 figures.

Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21789v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological Constraints on 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity and Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy: Implications for Black Hole Shadows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiang-Qian Li, Hao-Peng Yan, Xiao-Jun Yue<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The direct imaging of black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables precision tests of gravity in the strong-field regime. We investigate the cosmological evolution and optical appearance of black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy (KHDE). Utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) datasets, we constrain model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Results indicate that the late-time universe statistically favors a phantom-like equation of state ($c \approx 0.704$). Regarding the EGB coupling $α$, although data favor a positive value, the parameter space permits negative values down to a theoretical stability cut-off at $α\approx -0.03$. While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($α=0$) within the $2σ$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\sim 1\%$--$1.5\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $Λ$CDM predictions. These findings suggest that despite environmental dominance, precise statistical analyses of shadow populations could disentangle these subtle dynamic dark energy signals from the standard cosmological paradigm.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21479v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scalable and Robust Multiband Modeling of AGN Light Curves in Rubin-LSST <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Weixiang Yu, John J.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor tens of millions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for a period of 10 years with an average cadence of 3 days in six broad photometric bands. This unprecedented dataset will enable robust characterizations of AGN UV/optical variability across a wide range of AGN physical properties. However, existing tools for modeling AGN light curves are not yet capable of fully leveraging the volume, cadence, and multiband nature of LSST data. We present EzTaoX, a scalable light curve modeling tool designed to take advantage of LSST's multiband observations to simultaneously characterize AGN UV/optical stochastic variability and measure interband time delays. EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of $\sim 10^2-10^4 \times$ on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST -- both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields -- thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries. In addition, EzTaoX's multiband capability allows robust characterization of AGN stochastic variability down to hourly timescales, facilitating the identification of accreting low-mass AGNs -- such as those residing in dwarf galaxies -- through their distinctive variability signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21468v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing modified gravity with 3x2pt analyses in galaxy mocks <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marc Alemany-Gotor, Cristian Viglione, Pablo Fosalba, Isaac Tutusaus<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract), halo (abstract), haloes (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stage-IV surveys will enable unprecedented tests of gravity on cosmological scales. However, assuming General Relativity in the analysis of large-scale structure could introduce systematic biases if gravity deviates from GR at these scales. Modified gravity theories, such as the Hu-Sawicki formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, offer an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant, while remaining consistent with Solar System tests through screening mechanisms. In this work, we quantify the cosmological parameter biases that arise when using a combination of galaxy clustering and weak-lensing data-vectors, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, from an $f(R)$ galaxy mock under the incorrect assumption of GR, using for the first time high-fidelity full-sky galaxy mock catalogues. We employ a pair of twin simulations: one with GR and one with Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$. The mocks are built using an HOD method to populate the dark matter haloes with galaxies, calibrated against SDSS observations at low redshift. Using conservative scale cuts to minimise modelling uncertainties, we perform 3x2pt analyses and infer cosmological parameters through nested sampling, validating our pipeline with the GR mock. Our results show that when analysing the $f(R)$ galaxy mock assuming GR, the recovered cosmological parameters are very significantly biased, even when considering conservative scale cuts: the Figure of Bias reaches $\sim12σ$ for both $\{Ω_{\rm m}, σ_8\}$ and $S_8$. These biases persist even when marginalising over the galaxy bias and baryonic feedback, demonstrating that nuisance parameters cannot absorb the effects of modified gravity. We conclude that incorrectly assuming GR in a universe governed by $f(R)$ gravity leads to severe and detectable biases in cosmological inference for Stage-IV surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21463v2" target="_blank"><h2>Compton-induced $γ$-ray Cascade Emissions in Radio Galaxy NGC 1275 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mfuphi Ntshatsha, Markus Böttcher, Soebur Razzaque<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, contribution to the proceedings of HEASA 2025 annual conference<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Among active galactic nuclei (AGNi), blazars are the brightest emitters of high-energy (HE, $E \geq 100$ MeV) to very-high-energy (VHE, $E \geq 100$ GeV) $γ$-rays from their jets. Radio galaxies, being the misaligned parent population of the blazar class, were historically not detected at these frequencies.

The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds. While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $γ$-ray detectability threshold. In this paper, we propose a magnetar as the central engine of GRB 250114A by fitting the X-ray light curve, and infer a magnetic field strength $B_{\rm p}=13.24^{+1.73}_{-5.84} \, \times10^{15}\ \mathrm{G}$ and an initial spin period $P_{0}=14.31^{+0.93}_{-3.16} \, \mathrm{ms}$ of magnetar, with a jet correction, fall within a reasonable range.

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $δN$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21362v1" target="_blank"><h2>Weak gravity at micron scales from dark bubble cosmology and its cosmological consequences <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ulf Danielsson, Suvendu Giri<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-th, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16+1 pages<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-26<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future.

Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe.

Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}=10^{42.31\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 84 papers (69 new, 15 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
