The evolving relationship between galaxies and the

Lilly, Jorryt Matthee, Ruari Mackenzie, Anna-Christina Eilers, Rongmon Bordoloi, Robert A. Simcoe, Rohan P. Naidu, Minghao Yue, Bin Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and
the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization,
based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam $3.5\,\mathrm{\mu
m}$ slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948
[\OIII]$\lambda5008$-emitting galaxies with $-21.4\lesssim
M_\mathrm{UV}\lesssim -17.2$ spanning $5.33<z<6.97$ along six quasar
sightlines. We correlate these galaxies with \Lya\ and \Lyb\ transmission
measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift
intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy
density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at $z<5.50$,
while enhanced at $5.70<z<6.15$. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional
behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption
within $\sim 8$\,cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission
at intermediate scales ($\sim$5--20\,cMpc) at $z>5.70$. Statistical tests using
mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the
transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise
by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in
overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation
fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates
ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes
increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies.
These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized
regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually
extending into underdense regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03245v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Pandora project. II: how non-thermal physics drives bursty star

physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty,
clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the
processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using
high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from
\textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation,
magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal
retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal
physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar
mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the
metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of
star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of
cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both
ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations.
These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad
metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy.
Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with
recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal
physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy
formation models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04119v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics

galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number
densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive
($\rm M_*> 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies from $z=2-7$ in over 800
arcmin$^2$ of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a
total area $>$ 5 $\times$ previous JWST studies). We compute and report their
cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass
density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies
relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and
semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce
our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but
that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We
find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive
quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval $z=2-5$. This shows that
none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy
quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater
abundance of lower-mass ($\rm M_*<10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies than
previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple
colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside
individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the
observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper
increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than
has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from
$z=4.5$ to $z=2$, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching
within these epochs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03244v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and
  Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fabio Pacucci, Abraham Loeb</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters. 11 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST,
characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number
densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift
distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the
LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular
momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key
observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift
distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is
thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or
stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z \sim 5$
originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is
sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical
sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay
between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness
dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4<z<8$, during
which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z<4$, they are bright but rare,
while at $z>8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted
redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement.
Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering
and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected
outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the
LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation
of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03836v1" target="_blank"><h2>An independent estimate of H(z) at z = 0.5 from the stellar ages of
  brightest cluster galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S. Ilani Loubser, Adebusola B. Alabi, Matt Hilton, Yin-Zhe Ma, Xin Tang, Narges Hatamkhani, Catherine Cress, Rosalind E. Skelton, S. Andile Nkosi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Several cosmological observations (e.g., Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
Supernovae Type Ia, and local distance ladder measurements such as Cepheids)
have been used to measure the global expansion rate of the Universe, i.e., the
Hubble constant, $H_{0}$. However, these precision measurements have revealed
tensions between different probes that are proving difficult to solve.
Independent, robust techniques must be exploited to validate results or
mitigate systematic effects. We use the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) method, which
leverages the differential age evolution of passive galaxies, to measure
$H(z)$, without any assumption of the underlying cosmology. Unlike previous CC
studies, we used only brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the oldest and most
massive galaxies in the Universe, to construct a pure and homogeneous sample.
In this work we used a sample of 53 BCGs in massive, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
selected galaxy clusters (0.3 $< z <$ 0.7) with Southern African Large
Telescope (SALT) spectroscopic observations. We used optical spectra to measure
D4000$_{\rm n}$ of the BCGs to obtain a new direct measurement of $H(z) = 72.1
\pm 33.9(\rm stat) \pm 7.3$(syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0.5$. By using
BCGs, we significantly reduced the systematic errors to 10% by minimising the
stellar mass and metallicity dependence of the method. The dominant
uncertainty, and limitation for our study, is statistical, and we need larger,
homogeneous samples of the oldest, most massive galaxies. By using the
$Planck$+BAO prior of $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, the projected Hubble
constant is $H_{0}$ = $54.6 \pm 25.7(\rm stat) \pm 5.5$(syst) km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with both CMB and Cepheid measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04201v1" target="_blank"><h2>Analyzing Line-of-sight selection biases in galaxy-scale strong lensing

will dramatically increase the number of strong gravitational lensing systems,
requiring precise modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) effects to mitigate biases in
lensing observations and cosmological inferences. We develop a method to
construct joint distributions of external convergence ($\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$)
and shear ($\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$) for strong lensing LOS by aggregating
large-scale structure simulations with high-resolution halo renderings and
non-linear correction. Our approach captures both smooth background matter and
perturbations from halos, enabling accurate modeling of LOS effects. We apply
non-linear LOS corrections to $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ and
$\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$ that address the non-additive lensing effects caused by
objects along the LOS in strong lensing. We find that, with a minimum image
separation of $1.0^{\prime\prime}$, non-linear LOS correction due to the
presence of a dominant deflector slightly increases the ratio of quadruple to
double lenses; this non-linear LOS correction also introduces systematic biases
of $\sim 0.1\%$ for galaxy-AGN lenses in the inferred Hubble constant ($H_0$)
if not accounted for. We also observe a $0.66\%$ bias for galaxy-galaxy lenses
on $H_0$, and even larger biases up to $1.02\%$ for galaxy-AGN systems if LOS
effects are not accounted for. These results highlight the importance of LOS
for precision cosmology. The publicly available code and datasets provide tools
for incorporating LOS effects in future analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03015v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias

We welcome comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the
impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star
formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity
mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are
flux-weighted, and for many emission lines (e.g., H$\alpha$), flux scales with
SFR. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the
power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the
scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates
with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. In IllustrisTNG,
this secondary bias increases the two-halo term by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$
compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and
satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- sensitive to
intra-halo SFR distribution -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To
mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration
(for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h
\gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the
need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and
interpreting LIM observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04186v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Correlation Between FRB Dispersion Measure and Foreground Large-Scale

question in astronomy, and the dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs) serves as a valuable tool for probing this cosmic gas. We investigate
the impact of the foreground cosmic web on FRB DMs using 61 localized FRBs and
public galaxy catalogs. We test for the large-scale structure's impact on
cosmological DM using two methods. First, we searched for a correlation between
galaxy number density along the line of sight and extragalactic DM, and found a
statistically significant positive correlation ($p$ = $1.76 \times 10^{-5}$).
The shape of this correlation contains information about the cosmic baryon
distribution, and can also be used to better constrain host galaxy DM by
providing an estimate of the cosmic contribution on a per-source basis. We
observe similar correlations in a mock FRB survey based on the IllustrisTNG
cosmological simulation, where the DM is dominated by filaments in the IGM and
not by halos. Next, we performed a stacking analysis that measures the average
excess DM as a function of impact parameter of foreground galaxies to obtain
spatial information about how ionized gas is distributed around galaxy halos.
We report excess DM in the stacked signal for impact parameters up to Mpc
scales ($\sim$3$\sigma$). Finally, we identified FRBs that do not appear to
intersect intervening halos within $r_{vir}$, allowing us to estimate the
fraction of baryons that reside in the IGM. We find $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} \geq
0.69$ at 95$\%$ confidence, indicating significant astrophysical feedback.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03240v1" target="_blank"><h2>The cusp-halo relation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

initial density perturbations. In this work, we provide a framework to predict
for each halo the coefficient $A$ of its central cusp. We also present a
"cusp-NFW" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a
halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's
central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter
models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass
scale. To facilitate easy incorporation of prompt cusps into any halo modeling
approach, we provide a code package that implements the cusp-halo relation and
the cusp-NFW density profile.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03970v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Relativistic Jet in the Radio Quiet AGN Mrk 110</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ailing Wang, Tao An, Kenneth I. Kellermann, Hua Feng, Emmanuel K. Bempong-Manful, Roland Timmerman, Shaoguang Guo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report the discovery of a relativistic jet in Mrk~110, a narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxy historically classified as a radio-quiet active galactic
nucleus (AGN). Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations reveal
intermittent jet activity during 2015--2016 and 2022--2024, with proper motion
measurements yielding superluminal velocities of $\sim3.6\pm0.6\,c$ and
$\sim2.1\pm0.2\,c$, respectively. The recent jet component decelerates to $\sim
1.5\pm0.2\,c$ at a projected distance of 1.1 parsec from the core, coinciding
with the transition zone between broad-line and narrow-line regions. This
deceleration accompanies dramatic spectral evolution from steep (the spectral
index $\alpha \approx -0.63 \pm 0.04$) to inverted ($\alpha \approx +0.69 \pm
0.10$) as the 7.6 GHz flux density more than doubled. These episodic jet
ejections and their evolutionary pattern match theoretical predictions from
magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models for temporary jet formation in systems
with Mrk 110's physical parameters on timescales of months to years. The
observed jet deceleration distance matches expectations for relativistic
outflows interacting with the circumnuclear environment. These findings
demonstrate that the traditional radio-loud/quiet AGN dichotomy may reflect
time-averaged states rather than intrinsic capabilities, suggesting that jets
may form across the AGN population but become observable only during specific
accretion phases when MAD conditions are temporarily established. Mrk 110
serves as a critical "missing link" between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN,
providing insight into jet formation mechanisms, environmental interactions,
and physical processes that unify various AGN classifications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02848v1" target="_blank"><h2>Active galactic nuclei through the prism of galaxy clusters: bounds on

potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered
fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons
traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both
the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral
absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.
  Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features
in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of
cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new
approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic
field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in
magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of
photon-to-ALP conversion.
  With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP
parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will
significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using
different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The
Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe
the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03354v1" target="_blank"><h2>The galaxy-AGN scaling relations over 13 billion years in SHARK v2.0

Comments are welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The presence of strong correlations between super-massive black hole (SMBH)
masses and galaxy properties like stellar mass have been well-established in
the local Universe, but how these scaling relations evolve with cosmic time is
yet to be settled in both observations and theoretical models. Recent works
have also highlighted the role of galaxy morphology on the scatter of the
SMBH-galaxy mass scaling relations, while the impact of other galaxy properties
remains poorly studied, like the role of galaxy environment. We use the
state-of-the-art SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to explore the evolution of
these galaxy-SMBH scaling relations to expand the available predictions from
theoretical models to contrast with existing and upcoming observations. We find
the relations between SMBH masses and both total and bulge stellar mass
predicted by SHARK v2.0 to be in good overall agreement with observational
measurements across a wide range of redshift and stellar masses. These scaling
relations show a significant evolution as a function of cosmic time in SHARK
v2.0, with SMBH masses $\sim1$ dex lower at $z=0$ compared to $z=9$ at fixed
stellar mass and the scatter increasing by a factor of $\sim2-5$ towards low
redshift. Both relations show a strong dependence with galaxy morphology and
the main source for SMBH growth (gas accretion or mergers), with smaller trends
with star formation rate, galaxy sizes, and environment. We find that galaxy
morphology alone explains most of the scatter around both scaling relations,
with other galaxy properties tying to the SMBH scaling relations through their
correlations with morphology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03023v2" target="_blank"><h2>TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  TDCOSMO Collaboration, Simon Birrer, Elizabeth J.

(hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis
incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra
obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and
the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated
JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics
from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of
non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI
resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S)
sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface
brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected
for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally
conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors'
mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias.
Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with
$\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN)
dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find
$H_0=72.1^{+4.0}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are
in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on
$H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5
dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO)
likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present
constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM

$f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified
by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at $z = 2.2-6.6$, using publicly available
deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at
$0.4 - 5.0\, \mathrm{\mu m}$ to estimate their physical properties robustly,
and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (< 100 Myr) and
old LAEs (> 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation
activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star
formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact
morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The
$f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar
mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old
LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher
$f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ than young LAEs at a given stellar mass.
This implies that Ly$\alpha$ photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs,
possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows.
The average $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of young LAEs remains nearly
constant at $\sim40$% at $z = 2.2-6.6$, suggesting that the previously observed
evolution of global $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs.
Converting $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ to Lyman continuum escape
fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply
the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at $z\sim6$, causing rapid and
late reionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03536v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the Baryon Fraction in the Intergalactic Medium with 92

density model yields slightly higher $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ values compared to the
YMW16 model, the results are consistent within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level.
Additionally, there is no statistically significant evidence for redshift
evolution in $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. Our analysis constrains $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ to the
range $0.8 \sim 0.9$, providing strong support for the idea in which the
majority of the missing baryons reside in the diffuse IGM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02641v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observations of non complex organic molecules in the gas phase of the
  interstellar medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Charlotte Vastel, Francesco Fontani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted in Elsevier Handbook of Astrochemistry (2025)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The field of astrochemistry has seen major advances triggered by the
completion of new powerful radio telescopes, with gains in sensitivity of
receivers and in bandwidth. To date, about 330 molecular species are detected,
in interstellar clouds, circumstellar shells and even extragalactic sources.
The first interstellar molecules were first discovered through their electronic
transitions in the visual and near UV regions of the spectra in the 1930s. Then
the discovery of (pure) rotational transitions of interstellar molecules dates
back to the late 1960s. The improvement of detectors and the increase in
telescope sizes really opened up the submillimeter sky. The radio and
submillimeter ranges cover the lowest rotational lines of molecular species.
The bigger the molecule, the more spectral lines at different frequencies it
produces, with weaker line intensities. Over the past 30 years, we have
discovered that we live in a molecular universe, where molecules are abundant
and widespread, probing the structure and evolution of galaxies, as well as the
temperature and density of the observed medium, opening a new field called
astrochemistry. The progress has been dramatic, since the discovery of the
first molecules about 100 years ago. We present in this review, the detection
techniques that led to the discovery of the simple molecules in the gas phase
and the methodology that lead to the abundances determinations and the
comparison with chemical modelling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04004v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lonely Little Red Dots: Challenges to the AGN-nature of little red dots

unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs).
We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift
range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF,
JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models
with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on
the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find
that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components
is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC
suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially
when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field,
JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and
galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find
that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at
all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper
limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst
the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent
populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting
compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04031v1" target="_blank"><h2>Brightest Group Galaxies IV: Probing Size--Mass Relation and

Group Galaxies (BGGs) from redshift $z \simeq 0.08$ to $z = 3.7$ using the
\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}'s 255h COSMOS-Web program. This survey
provides deep NIRCam imaging in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W)
across $\sim 0.54~\mathrm{deg}^2$ and MIRI coverage in $\sim
0.2~\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. High-resolution NIRCam imaging enables
robust size and morphological measurements, while multiwavelength photometry
yields stellar masses, SFRs, and S\'ersic parameters. We classify BGGs as
star-forming and quiescent using both rest-frame NUV--$r$--$J$ colors and a
redshift-dependent specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold. Our analysis
reveals: (1) quiescent BGGs are systematically more compact than their
star-forming counterparts and exhibit steeper size--mass slopes; (2) effective
radii evolve as $R_e \propto (1+z)^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha = 1.11 \pm 0.07$
(star-forming) and $1.40 \pm 0.09$ (quiescent); (3) star formation surface
density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) increases with redshift and shows stronger
evolution for massive BGGs ($\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.75$); (4) in the
$\Sigma_e$--sSFR plane, a structural transition marks the quenching process,
with bulge-dominated systems comprising over 80\% of the quiescent population.
These results highlight the co-evolution of structure and star formation in
BGGs, shaped by both internal and environmental processes, and establish BGGs
as critical laboratories for studying the baryonic assembly and morphological
transformation of central galaxies in group-scale halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02937v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in
  the Milky Way Center</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chen Feng, Yong Tang, Yue-Liang Wu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes
(SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense
regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals
(EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH,
emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW)
observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals,
including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band
for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark
matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its
effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW
spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead
to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies
and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for
dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02799v1" target="_blank"><h2>Distance to the Galactic centre 7$^\prime$ halo from HI absorption</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Debangan Maji, Subhashis Roy</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Using archival data, we have made an HI absorption study of the 7$^\prime$
halo surrounding the Sgr A complex, observed towards the Galactic centre (GC)
region. We find strong HI absorption near velocities of $-$53 km s$^{-1}$,
which is due to the 3-kpc arm, placing it beyond 5 kpc from us. We further
examined the HI absorption properties towards 5 different parts of the
7$^\prime$ halo. Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3
parts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO
and CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the
+50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\prime$ halo is
partly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our
knowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\prime$ halo to be
located at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at
the GC region.</p></br></body>
