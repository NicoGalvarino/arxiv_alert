(NALs) with FWHM of $<$ 500 km/s (i.e., NAL outflows) in quasar spectra
contribute to feedback. As our sample, we choose 11 NAL systems in eight
optically luminous quasars from the NAL survey of Misawa et al. (2007a), based
on the following selection criteria: i) they exhibit ``partial coverage''
suggesting quasar origin (i.e., intrinsic NALs), ii) they have at least one
low-ionization absorption line (C II and/or Si II), and iii) the Ly$\alpha$
absorption line is covered by available spectra. The results depend critically
on this selection method, which has caveats and uncertainties associated with
it, as we discuss in a dedicated section of the paper. Using the column density
ratio of the excited and ground states of C II and Si II, we place upper limits
on the electron density as $n_{\rm e}$ $<$ 0.2 - 18 cm$^{-3}$ and lower limits
on their radial distance from the flux source $R$ as greater than several
hundreds of kpc. We also calculate lower limits on the mass outflow rate and
kinetic luminosity of $\log(\dot{M}/{\rm M_{\odot}~s}^{-1}) > 79$ - (3.1$\times
10^{5})$ and $\log(\dot{E_{\rm k}}/{\rm erg~s}^{-1}) > 42.9$ - 49.8,
respectively. Taking the NAL selection and these results at face value, the
inferred feedback efficiency can be comparable to or even larger than those of
broad absorption line and other outflow classes, and large enough to generate
significant AGN feedback. However, the question of the connection of
quasar-driven outflows to NAL absorbers at large distances from the central
engine remains open and should be addressed by future theoretical work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23742v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-redshift Galaxies from JWST Observations in More Realistic Dark

galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more
realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra
for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three
halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two
physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our
analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \simeq 8$--$10$ reveals
that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST
observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation
efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly
improved agreement with observations even within standard $\Lambda$CDM, with
statistical consistency within $1$--$2\sigma$ for moderate star formation
efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo
models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges,
particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo
formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled
with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between
theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical
assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse
physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate
apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\Lambda$CDM predictions,
highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics
in early cosmic epochs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23774v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lord of LRDs: Insights into a "Little Red Dot'' with a low-ionization

and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known
as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs
are found at z > 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early
stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a
broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1,
which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early
Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of
1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation
of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K
giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH
molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines
potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is
observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII]
emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in
an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant
variability in H$\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the
new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of
this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm
H}>10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a
complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular
absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23230v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of a Pair of Galaxies with Both Hosting X-ray Binary
  Candidates at $z=2.544$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sijia Cai, Zheng Cai, Jianwei Lyu, Yunjing Wu, Xiaojing Lin, Mingyu Li, Junjie Mao, Jiayi Chen, Pengjun Lu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), JWST (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), dust (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Among high-redshift galaxies, aside from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), X-ray
binaries (XRBs) can be significant sources of X-ray emission. XRBs play a
crucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of
galaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy
structure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray
emitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at $z = 2.544$. By combining
multi-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and
MIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission
lines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally,
we find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust
emission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission
from these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of
$L_X= (1.43\pm0.40) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3,
and $(0.40\pm0.12) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3-2.
Furthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of $529_{-88}^{+64}$
$M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for UDF3, placing it $\approx$ 0.5 dex below the
$L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement
of $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a
key observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of
$34_{-6}^{+6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, aligns well with the $L_X$/SFR-$z$
relation. This galaxy pair represents the highest-redshift non-AGN-dominated
galaxies with individual X-ray detections reported to date. This finding
suggests that the contribution of XRBs to galaxy X-ray emission at high
redshift may be underestimated.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23100v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chandra X-ray Observatory study of the X-ray emission of PKS 0023-26 and

powerful compact radio source PKS 0023-26 associated with a quasar at redshift
0.322. The earlier studies of the optical environment suggested that the source
could be located in a galaxy cluster or a group. However, we report a
non-detection of hot gas on large scales (out to $\sim 60$ kpc radius) and
place an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $ < 3\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
consistent only with the presence of a poor, low-temperature ($\rm kT < 0.5$
keV) galaxy group. X-ray spectral analysis of the central circular region,
$r < 7$ kpc shows, in addition to the mildly absorbed AGN, a thermal emission
component with a temperature of $\rm kT=0.9^{+0.19}_{-0.37}$ keV. We discuss
the origin of this hot component as a result of interaction between the
evolving radio source and the interstellar medium. Our high angular resolution
X-ray image traces the distribution of hot gas which is closely aligned with
and extends beyond the radio source, and also in the direction perpendicular to
the radio source axis. The X-rays are enhanced at the northern radio lobe and
the location of the peak of the CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) line emission, suggesting that
the interactions between the jet and cold medium result in the X-ray radiation
which excites CO. The shock driven by the jet into the ISM is supersonic with
the Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 1.75-2$, creating the cocoon of hot X-rays
surrounding the radio source. This result agrees with observations of shocks in
other radio galaxies pointing to a prevalent impact of jets on ISM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23066v1" target="_blank"><h2>SHELLQs-JWST perspective on the intrinsic mass relation between

host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the
earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such
investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars
within the first billion years of the universe (z > 6). Here, we evaluate the
relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host
galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 < z < 6.4 from the Subaru
High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and
NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in
the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log MBH ~ 8-9; log M* ~9.5-11) is consistent with a
non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_{-0.28}^{+0.23} dex)
higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex). Our analysis is based on a forward
model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection
effects and measurement uncertainties, an assumption on the slope of the mass
relation, and finds a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with
an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a
substantially higher normalisation in MBH would require an unrealistically low
intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex) and a lower AGN fraction (~0.6%).
Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black
hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with
JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23654v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JWST Unveils the Bimodal Nature of Lyman Alpha Emitters at 3 < z < 7:

(LAEs) using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution imaging data. From a large sample of
817 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3 < z < 7$ in the GOODS-S field, we
identify late-stage mergers and interacting systems with fractions of
$39.4\%\pm2.5\%$ and $60.6\%\pm6.3\%$, respectively. These fractions exhibit
significant redshift evolution and depend on both stellar mass ($M_*$) and UV
magnitude ($M_{\rm UV}$), being most prevalent in massive
($\log(M_*/M_\odot)>8.5$) and bright ($M_{\rm UV}<-19.5$) systems. At fixed
$M_*$ and $M_{\rm UV}$, we find negligible differences in the UV slope
($\beta$) between late-stage mergers and isolated LAEs; however, a clear
bimodal distribution emerges in the $M_*$-sSFR plane, where isolated LAEs peak
at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx7.8$ and $\log({\rm sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.4$, and
late-stage mergers peak at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx8.6$ and $\log({\rm
sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.6$. Our results reveal two evolutionary classes --
Pristine LAEs, low-mass ($M_* < 10^{8.5}M_\odot$), isolated systems that
represent early-stage galaxies with minimal merger interactions, and
Merger-driven LAEs, massive ($M_*>10^{8.5}M_\odot$) systems in which mergers
enhance star formation and facilitate the escape of Lyman-alpha photons or
accrete pristine LAEs -- both of which are consistent with both observational
and theoretical expectations and collectively demonstrate that mergers are a
central driver of LAE evolution across the first two billion years.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22575v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting cosmic acceleration with DESI BAO</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jincheng Wang, Hongwei Yu, Puxun Wu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We revisit the evolution of cosmic acceleration in a spatially flat

CPL parametrization, using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in
combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and several type

the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ and the jerk parameter $j(z)$ and further
validate our results using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our findings indicate
significant deviations from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model.
Specifically, DESI BAO, DESI BAO + CMB, DESI BAO + CMB + Union3, and DESI BAO +
CMB + DESY5 all provide strong evidence for a slowing down of cosmic
acceleration at late times, as indicated by $j(0) < 0$ at more than 1$\sigma$

suggest that in the $w_0w_a$CDM universe cosmic acceleration has already peaked

and evolution of disc galaxies; however, the precise nature of spiral arms
remains uncertain. Two challenges in understanding the mechanisms driving
spirals are how galactic environment impacts spiral morphology and how they
evolve over time. We present a catalog characterizing the properties, dynamics,
and evolution of m=2 spiral structure in 10 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the
FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Consistent with previous literature,
we find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously
present in the disc at varying pattern speeds ($\Omega_p$) that broadly
decrease with radius. These spirals persist on Gyr timescales (mean duration
1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of Myr. Tidal
interactions and bar episodes impact the resulting m=2 spiral structure; strong
satellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with
larger radial extent, and bars can increase $\Omega_p$. Galactic environment
influences spiral structure; kinematically colder discs can support
longer-lived, stronger spirals. The properties of identified spirals in FIRE-2
vary widely in radial extent (0.3-10.8 kpc), duration (1.00-6.00 Gyr), and
amplitudes ($a_{2,\text{max}}$=0.018-0.192). We find the presence of spirals in
all age populations, suggesting these are density wave-driven features. This
work represents the first time that spiral structure has been cataloged in this
manner in cosmological simulations; the catalog can be leveraged with current
and forthcoming observational surveys, enabling systematic comparisons to
further our understanding of galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22453v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGN contribution on the morphological parameters of their host galaxies

classification of galaxies. This work aims to determine how the contribution of
AGN affects the most used morphological parameters down to the redshift of z~2
in COSMOS-like conditions. We use a sample of > 2000 local non-active galaxies,
with a well-known visual morphological classification, and add an AGN as an
unresolved component that contributes to the total galaxy flux with 5%-75%. We
moved all the galaxies to lower magnitudes (higher redshifts) to map the
conditions in the COSMOS field, and we measured six morphological parameters.
The greatest impact on morphology occurs when considering the combined effect
of magnitude, redshift and AGN, with spiral galaxies being the most affected.
In general, all the concentration parameters change significantly if the AGN
contribution is > 25% and the magnitude > 23. We find that the GINI coefficient
is the most stable in terms of AGN and magnitude/redshift, followed by the M20,
Conselice-Bershady (CCON), and finally the Abraham (CABR) concentration
indexes. We find that, when using morphological parameters, the combination of
CABR, CCON and asymmetry is the most effective in classifying active galaxies
at high-redshift, followed by the combination of CABR and GINI.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23451v1" target="_blank"><h2>Automated calibration of simulated galaxy catalogues for cosmological
