  Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anirban Chowdhary, Suchetana Chatterjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ on 12th August 2025, 19 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract), quasar (title, abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to
explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar
halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the
quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13}
M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function.
We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars
selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias
({\bf a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in
the satellite occupation fraction}) is introduced in the reconstruction of
quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation
function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the
central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the
occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows
a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction
of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$
of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with
previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while
the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and
feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole
(SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter
space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has
been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08363v1" target="_blank"><h2>On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization -- influence

formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress
accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of
galaxies at $z\geq\!5$ using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track
gas-phase and stellar metallicities $(Z_\text{g}, Z_\star)$ and dust mass
$(M_{\rm d})$ in dark matter haloes spanning $M_{\rm h} = 10^6 -
10^{11}\,M_\odot$, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios,
which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and
we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback
induces oscillations in $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, with $Z_{\rm g}$ declining
sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar
and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant
scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid $Z_{\rm g}$ decline.
Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at $z=7-10$, flattening
the $Z_{\rm g}$-mass relation to $\simeq 0.03 - 0.04\,Z_\odot$. Dust production
tracks $Z_{\rm g}$ but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed
enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples $Z_{\rm g}$
and $Z_\star$, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and
delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos $(M_{\rm
h}\sim 10^7\,M_\odot)$, where shallow potentials amplify the impact of
feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and
semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST
metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star
formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08356v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Discovery of Strong Lensing from a Galaxy Cluster at Cosmic Noon:

discovery of strong gravitational lensing arcs from XLSSC 122 ($z=1.98$) -
setting the record for the most distant galaxy cluster that exhibits strong
lensing. The discovery of giant arcs enables a strong-lensing analysis and a
measurement of the concentration of the dark matter halo. We perform a
strong-lensing analysis of the cluster and measure the radial projected mass
density profile. Our measurements reveal an exceptionally high concentration in
the core of XLSSC 122. A Navarro--Frenk--White profile fit to the inner 100 kpc
estimates the concentration to be $6.3\pm0.5$. The high concentration of XLSSC
122 contributes to the emerging picture that massive structure formation in the
early universe may proceed more rapidly than standard models suggest. We
estimate the mass within 100 kpc to be $M$($R<$100 kpc) =
$6.5\pm0.7\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$. Our mosaic images are made public at

  Formation in Little Red Dots</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Seok-Jun Chang, Max Gronke, Jorryt Matthee, Charlotte Mason</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 20 figure, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), kinematics (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at $z>5$ discovered through JWST
spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines
($\gtrsim1000\rm~km~s^{-1}$), alongside absorption features and a pronounced
Balmer break -- evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the $n=2$
state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black
hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their
stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole--galaxy co-evolution.
However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the
formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes
shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$
state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson
scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their
imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong
deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden
H$\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\alpha$. While Raman scattering can yield
broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of
strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher
Lyman-series emission can produce H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ wing width ratios of
$\gtrsim1.28$, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the
observed $\gtrsim1000~\rm km\, s^{-1}$ wings under plausible conditions, e.g.,
$T_{\rm e} \sim 10^4\rm \, K$ and $N_{\rm e}\sim10^{24}\rm~cm^{-2}$ -- and lead
to black hole mass overestimates by factors $\gtrsim10$. Our results provide a
framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08577v1" target="_blank"><h2>RUBIES spectroscopically confirms the high number density of quiescent

work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and
an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical
properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within
RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using
star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the
NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection
function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density
of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete
spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early
massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$
Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4 < z < 5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST
photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number
densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy
formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough
massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the
channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution
models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08460v1" target="_blank"><h2>MAGAZ3NE: Far-IR and Radio Insights into the Nature and Properties of

Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> molecular gas (abstract), high redshift (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Deep and wide-field near-infrared (NIR) surveys have recently discovered and
confirmed ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})>11$)
spectroscopically at high redshift. However, most are characterized using only
ultraviolet (UV)-to-NIR photometry, offering limited insight into obscured star
formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In this work, we add ten
far-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for
two spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616
($z_{\rm spec} = 3.255$) and COS-DR1-209435 ($z_{\rm spec} = 2.481$). Utilizing
the full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based
interpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously
identified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured
galaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively
star-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its
molecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth.
In contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a
prolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in
stellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})$ = 11.72
over the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in
both UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may
have contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to
form stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet
suppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio
observations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at
$z\gtrsim3$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08784v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping the Milky Way with Gaia Bp/Rp spectra II: The inner stellar halo

parameters inferred from Gaia Bp/Rp spectra. We generated the synthetic SDSS
broad-band $ugr$ and Pristine narrow-band CaHK magnitudes from Gaia Bp/Rp data.
A photometric selection of BHB candidates was made in the $(u-g, g-r)$ and
$(u-\mathrm{CaHK},g-r)$ color-color spaces. A spectroscopic selection in
$T_\mathrm{eff}-\log g$ space was applied to remove stars with high surface
gravity. The selection function of BHB stars was obtained by using the Gaia DR3
photometry. A non-parametric method that allows the variation in the vertical
flattening $q$ with the Galactic radius, was adopted to explore the density
shape of the stellar halo. We present a catalog of 44,552 high latitude
($|b|>20^\circ$) BHB candidates chosen with a well-characterized selection
function. The stellar halo traced by these BHB stars is more flattened at
smaller radii ($q=0.4$ at $r\sim8$ kpc), and becomes nearly spherical at larger
radii ($q=0.8$ at $r\sim25$ kpc). Assuming a variable flattening and excluding
several obvious outliers that might be related to the halo substructures or
contaminants, we obtain a smooth and consistent relationship between $r$ and
$q$, and the density profile is best fit with by a single power law with an
index $\alpha=-4.65\pm0.04$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08451v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quantification of The Age Dependence of Mid-Infrared Star Formation Rate

the hydrogen recombination line Pa-alpha (lambda=1.8756 micron) from the Cycle
1 program JWST-FEAST with 21 micron dust continuum images from the Cycle 2
Treasury program JWGT to quantify the difference in the calibration of
mid-infrared star formation rates (SFR) between HII regions and galaxies. We
use the archival HST H-alpha image to correct the Pa-alpha emission for the
effects of dust attenuation. Our data confirm previous results that the
dust-corrected Pa-alpha flux is tightly correlated with the 21 micron emission
at the scales of HII regions. When combined with published JWST data for the
HII regions of the galaxy NGC 628 and Spitzer 24 micron data for whole galaxies
and for kpc-size galaxy regions, we show that the L(24)-L(Pa-alpha) correlation
has exponent >1 across six decades in luminosity. In addition, the hybrid 24
micron+H-alpha SFR indicator has a scaling constant about 4.4 times higher for
HII regions than for whole galaxies, also in agreement with previous results.
Models of stellar populations with a range of star formation histories reveal
that the observed trends can be entirely ascribed to and quantified with the
contribution to the IR emission by stellar populations older than ~5-6 Myr.
Based on the models' results, we provide: (1) a calibration for the infrared
SFR across six orders of magnitude in L(24), from HII regions to luminous
galaxies, and (2) a prescription for the scaling constant of the hybrid
infrared SFR indicators as a function of the star formation timescale.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08455v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematic patterns of the enriched gas phase in the Local Group {\sc

existence of a velocity dipole in the general barycentre--antibarycentre
direction which can be interpreted as evidence of a general flow of material
towards the group's centre of mass. In this work, we study the kinematics of
gas in the Local Group using one of the high-resolution realisations of the
{\sc Hestia} simulations with a particular focus on the evidence left by
different ionic species. Our simulation includes the correct cosmography for a
region similar to the Local Group and a relative radial velocity between the
candidate Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies consistent with the observed one. We
examine the distribution and kinematics of six ionic species (H\,{\sc i},
C\,{\sc iv}, Si\,{\sc iii}, O\,{\sc vi}, O\,{\sc vii} and O\,{\sc viii}) and
their imprints on synthetic sky maps constructed from the reference frames
commonly used by observers. Our results indicate the presence of such a dipole
for gas outside the Milky Way halo, favouring a paradigm in which the Milky Way
is moving against the gas in the direction of the barycentre, while moving away
from it in the opposite direction. This pattern is clearer for the higher
oxygen ions, which preferentially trace hot gas. On the other hand, we observe
a slight asymmetry in the pressure profiles in both directions, indicating
higher pressures in the inner regions of the Local Group.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08603v1" target="_blank"><h2>Infrared and Optical Emission-line Diagnostics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mark Durré</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 11 figures.

infra-red (NIR) and optical spectra, where we examine the relationship between
the respective nuclear activity classifications, diagnosed by the flux ratios
of emission lines. We match the standard NIR classification with four different
optical classifications. While there is a broad agreement between the two
regimes, there are mismatches and overlaps caused either by aperture effects
and/or NIR radiation penetrating obscuring dust and "seeing deeper" into the
nuclear region, thus exposing AGN activity. We examine the relationship between
the equivalent widths (EW) of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, as well as the ratios [N

propose a new diagnostic (EW of Pa$\beta$ with Fe - WPF) in the NIR (analogous
to the WHaN classification), using the [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$ flux ratio and the EW
of the Pa$\beta$ line. We show, within the limitations of the catalogue size,
that the regions of the standard NIR diagram can be reasonably replicated in
this new scheme. This diagnostic has the advantage that only one wavelength

galaxies (PSBs) at $0.7 < z < 0.9$ in the COSMOS field as a function of central
concentration of asymmetric features, $C_{A}$, in order to understand their
origins. We measured the colour gradients for 33 PSBs, 332 quiescent galaxies
(QGs), and 1136 star-forming gaaxies (SFGs) by using COSMOS $HST$/ACS
$I_{F814W}$-band and COSMOS-DASH $HST$/WFC3 $H_{F160W}$-band data. We found
that the colour gradient, $\Delta (I-H) = (I-H)_{in} - (I-H)_{out}$, decreases
with increasing $C_{A}$ for all the three populations. Only PSBs with
$\log{C_{A}} > 0.6$ show positive gradients, which suggests that their central
asymmetric features are caused by disturbed distribution of relatively young
stars near the centre. The colour gradients are also closely related with
half-light radius rather than stellar mass for all the populations. The
positive colour gradients and very small sizes of those PSBs with high $C_A$
suggest that a nuclear starburst caused by gas-rich major merger occurred in
the recent past. On the other hand, similarly massive PSBs with $\log C_A <
0.6$ show the negative colour gradients, heavier dust extinction, and larger
sizes, and their origins may be different from those PSBs with high $C_A$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08710v1" target="_blank"><h2>Search for Slow Bars in Two Barred Galaxies with Nuclear Structures: NGC

method and detect kinematically decoupled nuclear disks in both galaxies. We
also measure the bar length and strength using Pan-STARRs images and identify a
nuclear ring in NGC 6951 and a nuclear bar in NGC 7716 from HST/PC images. Our
results indicate that NGC 6951 hosts a slow, long, and strong bar, which likely
evolved through interactions with the dark matter halo and contributed to the
formation of both the nuclear disk and ring. We also find hints of a rapidly
rotating oval structure within the primary bar, although it is not clearly seen
in the imaging data. In contrast, the primary bar in NGC 7716 is too weak to be
classified as a barred galaxy, while its nuclear disk and nuclear bar are
unusually large, possibly due to tidal interactions or the weakness of the
primary bar. These findings suggest that slow bars may be more observed in
galaxies with nuclear structures and highlight the often underappreciated role
of galaxy interactions in bar evolution.</p></br></body>
