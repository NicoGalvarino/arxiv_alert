  Catalog</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shaohua Zhang, Yuchong Luo, Shangchun Xie, Chao Gao, Zhijian Luo, Chenggang Shu, Hubing Xiao</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submited to ApJS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present, for the first time, a systematic study of quasar-associated 2175
\AA\ dust absorbers using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 16 (DR16). By analyzing the optical spectra and multi-band
magnitudes of 557,674 quasars in the redshift range of $0.7 \le z \le 2.4$, we
identify 843 absorbers that share the same redshifts as quasars and are
believed to originate from dust in the quasar nuclei, the host galaxies, or
their surrounding environments. These absorbers exhibit weak bump strengths
($A\rm_{bump}=0.49\pm0.15~\mu m^{-1}$) and narrow widths
($\gamma\rm=0.81\pm0.14~\mu m^{-1}$), while their peak positions span a broad
range from $x_0 = 4.2$ to $4.84~ \mu m^{-1}$. Their average extinction curves
resemble those of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) but exhibit a shallower
slope. In broad absorption line (BAL) quasars, the absorption bumps show
systematic shifts in peak positions. Although further confirmation is needed,
this may suggest environmental differences in dust grain properties. We find a
statistically significant negative correlation between bump strength and
redshift, suggesting possible evolution in dust properties. These findings
highlight the changing composition and physical conditions of dust in quasar
environments, likely influenced by factors such as metallicity, radiation
fields, and dust processing mechanisms. Future studies incorporating
ultraviolet and infrared data will be essential for refining the dust evolution
models. Machine learning techniques and high-resolution spectroscopic
follow-ups could enhance sample completeness and provide deeper insights into
the chemical properties of the dust absorbers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21492v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust removal timescale in galaxies across cosmic time</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aleksandra Leśniewska, Jens Hjorth, Christa Gall</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to A&A, under review</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Understanding the evolution of dust in galaxies is crucial because it affects
the dynamics and cooling of gas, star formation, and chemical evolution. Recent
work on dust removal in galaxies indicates timescales of gigayears, with old
stellar populations and AGNs as the primary drivers of this process. However,
most statistically significant studies are focused on low redshifts $z < 0.4$.
Here, we determine the dust removal timescale in galaxies over a wide range of
redshifts, up to $z \sim 5$. We use publicly available catalogue data of
infrared-selected galaxies, observed by \textit{Herschel}. Using the inferred
dust masses, stellar masses, and stellar ages, we calculate the dust removal
timescale in a sample of more than 120,000 galaxies. We find that, with
increasing redshift, the dust removal timescale decreases from 1.8 Gyr at
redshift $z \sim 0.05$ to less than 500\,Myr at $z > 3$. Galaxies at higher
redshifts undergo more efficient dust removal than galaxies at lower redshift,
likely driven by AGN activity, supernova shocks, and astration. These findings
indicate that dust removal evolves over cosmic time, reflecting the changing
mechanisms regulating dust content of galaxies as the Universe evolves.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21107v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MUSE view of ram pressure stripped galaxies in clusters: the GASP

z=0.04-0.07 observed with VLT/MUSE by the GASP survey. Most of them (64) were
observed as possible ram pressure stripped galaxies (stripping candidates)
based on optical B-band images, while the remaining 12 were a control sample of
both star-forming and passive galaxies. Based on spatially resolved ionized gas
and stellar kinematics, we assess the physical origin of the gas asymmetries
and find that 89% of the stripping candidates are confirmed by the VLT/MUSE
data. In addition, also 3 of the 4 star-forming galaxies in the control sample
show signs of ram pressure. These control galaxies display a ring of unusual
emission line ratios, which we see also in field galaxies, possibly originating
from the interaction with a hotter surrounding medium. The stripped galaxies
are classified into various classes corresponding to different degrees of
stripping, from weakest stripping to strong and extreme (jellyfish galaxies)
stripping, as well as truncated gas disks with gas left only in the galaxy
center. Our results show that selecting cluster stripping candidates based on
optical imaging yields a sample that is indeed largely dominated by galaxies
affected by ram pressure at different stages and stripping strength, though
some contamination is present, mostly by tidal processes. Strong ram pressure
cases are found in galaxies over the whole range of stellar masses studied
(10^9-10^11.5 Msun) both in low-mass and high-mass clusters (cluster velocity
dispersions sigma = 500-1100 km/s). We examine the possible connection between
the progressive stages of stripping, up to the phase of a truncated gas disk,
and the subsequent complete stripping of gas. We discuss the incompleteness
intrinsic to this and other methods of selection to obtain a complete census of
ram pressure stripping in clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20821v1" target="_blank"><h2>A candidate for True Type-2 AGN without hidden central BLRs Identified

expected variability properties, a potential candidate for True type-2 AGN
without hidden central broad line regions (=TT2AGN) is reported in the SDSS
J233454.07+145712.9 (=SDSS J2334). Through analyzing the 20-years optical light
curves of SDSS J2334 from different Sky Survey projects, a TDE is preferred
with a $4.7{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star tidally disrupted by the central
BH with mass $11.7\times 10^6{\rm M_\odot}$, indicating that central region
within distance about 20 light-days to central BH in SDSS J2334 is directly in
the line-of-sight. Moreover, AGN activities in SDSS J2334 can be confirmed
through applications of BPT diagrams. Meanwhile, comparing virial BH mass
determined through assumed broad Balmer emission components and M-sigma
expected BH mass by well measured stellar velocity dispersion through stellar
absorption features, optical broad emission lines in SDSS J2334 are disfavored
with confidence level higher than 6$\sigma$. Therefore, combining the unique
properties of the TDE and the spectroscopic results with only narrow emission
lines, SDSS J2334 can be well identified as a potential candidate for a TT2AGN.
The results indicate the to detect TDE expected flares in normal Type-2 AGN
classified by spectroscopic results should be a new practicable method for

of the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square
of 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through
the analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates,
ages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first
time, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from
full-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young
stellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars,
young massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of
concordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The
metallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial
metallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with
our chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is
observed in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with
circumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the
circumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to
AGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity
with a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and
molecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation
between R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission
strength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm
our results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21260v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star
  formation history profiles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Heinrich Steigerwald</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted by PRD, citation requests welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its
resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to
identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or
accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations
are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations
where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the
signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have
been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless
replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for
galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient
rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we
combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star
formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and
efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation
rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar
masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the
hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the
ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21105v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identifying Compton-thick AGNs with Machine learning algorithm in

Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs), which are defined by column
density $\mathrm{N_H} \geqslant 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, emit
feeble X-ray radiation, even undetectable by X-ray instruments. Despite this,
the X-ray emissions from CT-AGNs are believed to be a substantial contributor
to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). According to synthesis models of AGNs,
CT-AGNs are expected to make up a significant fraction of the AGN population,
likely around 30% or more. However, only $\sim$11% of AGNs have been identified
as CT-AGNs in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS). To identify hitherto unknown
CT-AGNs in the field, we used a Random Forest algorithm for identifying them.
First, we build a secure classified subset of 210 AGNs to train and evaluate
our algorithm. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 90% on the test set
after training. Then, we applied our algorithm to an additional subset of 254
AGNs, successfully identifying 67 CT-AGNs within this group. This result
significantly increased the fraction of CT-AGNs in the CDFS, which is closer to
the theoretical predictions of the CXB. Finally, we compared the properties of
host galaxies between CT-AGNs and non-CT-AGNs and found that the host galaxies
of CT-AGNs exhibit higher levels of star formation activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21188v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Adriel I. Santoso, Le Bin Ho</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> quant-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in
fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We
propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to
ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit,
interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line,
ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit
systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational
quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical
Cramer-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is
employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our
results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform
conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths
compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains
robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of
network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for
quantum-enhanced DM detection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21352v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of a kinematically distinct component in the central region of

collisional ring galaxy AM0644-741 using HST imaging and MUSE integral field
unit (IFU) data. We identified two S\'ersic components with a S\'ersic index of
1.72 (inner part) and 1.11 (outer part) in the HST F814W band optical image
using \textsc{Galfit}. We utilized the MUSE data cube to construct stellar line
of sight velocity (V$_{\rm LOS}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm LOS}$),
h$_3$ \& h$_4$ velocity moments, and stellar population age maps using the
\textsc{GIST} pipeline for further investigating both S\'ersic components,
which have a difference of $\sim$ 60 degrees in their position angle. The inner
component, with an effective radius $\sim$1 kpc, shows a strong anticorrelation
between V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm LOS}$ and h$_3$, indicating the presence of
a rotating stellar structure. In addition, the inner component also shows a
relatively higher velocity dispersion (average values reaching up to $\sim$240
km sec$^{-1}$) along with disky isophotes and stronger Mg~$b$ line strength,
which all together highlight a peculiar dynamical state of AM0644-741's central
region. Our analysis suggests that the recent encounter has had a smaller
impact on the stellar orbits within the inner component. In contrast, it has
specifically affected the stellar orbits of the progenitor's outer disk when
forming the star-forming ring. The BPT analysis of the unresolved nuclear
source shows a LINER-type ionization, hinting at AGN activity in the galaxy.
Our study projects the dynamical evolution of collisional systems and provides
scope for simulations to explore the central region in greater detail.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20656v1" target="_blank"><h2>A joint analysis of 3D clustering and galaxy \times CMB-lensing

Zou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 43 pages, 14 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The spectroscopic data from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxies enables the
analysis of 3D clustering by fitting galaxy power spectra and reconstructed
correlation functions in redshift space. Given low measurements of the
amplitude of structure from cosmic shear at $z\sim1$, redshift space
distortions (RSD) + Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals from DESI
galaxies combined with weak lensing can break degeneracies and provide a tight
alternative constraint on the $z\sim1$ amplitude of structure. In this paper we
perform joint analyses that combine full-shape + post-reconstruction
information from the DESI DR1 BGS and LRG samples along with angular
cross-correlations with Planck PR4 and ACT DR6 CMB lensing maps. We show that
adding galaxy-lensing cross-correlations tightens clustering amplitude
constraints, improving $\sigma_8$ uncertainties by $\sim 40\%$ over RSD+BAO
alone. We also include angular galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-lensing spectra using
photometric samples from the DESI Legacy Survey to further improve constraints.
Our headline results are $\sigma_8 = 0.803\pm 0.017$, $\Omega_{\rm m} =
0.3037\pm 0.0069$, and $S_8 = 0.808\pm 0.017$. Given DESI's preference for
higher $\sigma_8$ compared to lower values from BOSS, we perform a
catalog-level comparison of LRG samples from both surveys. We test sensitivity
to dark energy assumptions by relaxing our $\Lambda$CDM prior and allowing for
evolving dark energy via the $w_0-w_a$ parameterization. We find our $S_8$
constraints to be relatively unchanged despite a $~3.5\sigma$ tension with the
cosmological constant model when combining with the Union3 supernova
likelihood. Finally we test general relativity (GR) by allowing the
gravitational slip parameter ($\gamma$) to vary, and find $\gamma =
1.17\pm0.11$ in mild ($\sim1.5\sigma$) tension with the GR value of $1.0$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21463v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jake Hassan, Rosalba Perna, Matteo Cantiello, Tyler Parsotan, Davide Lazzati, Nathan Walker</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from
primordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through
their influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the
formation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct
detection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational
capabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic
lensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to
observable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models
for their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar
populations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties
of non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we
expand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and
post-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and
magnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for
isolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while
rotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent
evolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones
potentially visible with only moderate lensing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20669v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping the Star Formation and HI Gas Properties of Galaxies Along
  Large-scale Structures Around the Virgo Cluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hyein Yoon, O. Ivy Wong, Aeree Chung, Shan Huang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the star formation and neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas
properties of galaxies along three large-scale filaments and two galaxy groups
in the wide field around the Virgo cluster. Our goal is to understand how
galaxies are processed in low-density environments before falling into
high-density regions. Combining the spatial distribution of galaxies with
multiwavelength colors such as W3-W1, NUV-r, and g-r, we find a predominance of
blue galaxies across the structures, indicating normal-to-enhanced star
formation, similar to that of isolated galaxies. However, one filament and one
group show a significant number of red galaxies (32% and 20%, respectively),
suggesting that star formation has been suppressed in low-density environments
before reaching high-density regions. Intriguingly, these red galaxies span a
wide range of stellar masses, and the presence of red dwarfs support that not
only mass but also environment plays an important role in the quenching of star
formation in cluster outskirts. One particular filament, potentially connected
to Virgo, already has a group of red populations outside Virgo's R_200, making
these galaxies good candidates for being "preprocessed" before entering the
Virgo cluster. In addition, several galaxies in the filaments and groups
possess relatively low HI gas contents, similar to cluster galaxies. However,
the overall fraction of HI-deficient galaxies is not as significantly high as
the fraction of red galaxies in these structures. This suggests that HI gas
properties are less influenced by the environment than star formation
properties in low-density regions, possibly due to gas replenishment through
accretion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21273v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rotational equilibrium of C$_2$ in diffuse interstellar clouds</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

Lambert</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context. Recent spectroscopic measurements have revealed absorption from
higher rotational levels in C$_2$ than previous observations. These
improvements are accompanied by the availability of updated radiative and
collisional data. Aims. We revisit the density and radiation field intensity
diagnostics provided by the observations of many rotational levels of inter-
stellar C$_2$ and extensive molecular information. Methods. We built an
excitation model of C2 without spatial structure, including levels up to J= 34
where updated radiative and collisional excitation data are introduced as well
as excitation by chemical formation. Results. We confirm the importance of the
recent collisional excitation rate coefficients of C$_2$ by molecular H$_2$. We
show that the new higher level observations cannot be explained by the standard
balance between collisional excitation and radiative transitions. We propose
that chemical excitation at formation provides a plausible mechanism to explain
the observed high excitation of C$_2$. In addition, it allows us to lift the
degeneracy of the density over radiation field strength parameter in the
excitation model. Conclusions. A 0D model remains limited and it is highly
desirable to use a full Photon Dominated Region (PDR) model, which includes all
excitation processes introduced here and full chemical and thermal balance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21307v1" target="_blank"><h2>PRODIGE - envelope to disk with NOEMA: V. Low 12C/13C ratios for CH3OH

(20-50 K) and a couple protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres. However,
direct measurements of this ratio in the warm gas (>100 K) around young
low-mass protostars remain scarce, but are required to study its evolution
during star and planet formation. We derived 12C/13C ratios from the
isotopologues of the complex organic molecules (COMs) CH3OH and CH3CN in the
warm gas towards seven Class 0/I protostellar systems to improve our
understanding of the evolution of the 12C/13C ratios during star and planet
formation. We used the data that were taken as part of the PRODIGE large
program with the NOEMA at 1mm. The emission of CH3OH and CH3CN is spatially
unresolved in the PRODIGE data (300au scale). Derived rotational temperatures
exceed 100K, telling us that they trace the gas of the hot corino, where CH3CN
probes hotter regions than CH3OH on average (290 K versus 180 K). The column
density ratios between the 12C and 13C isotopologues, derived from LTE
analysis, range from 4 to 30, thus, are significantly lower than the expected
local ISM isotope ratio of about 68. Assuming that CH3CN and CH3OH may inherit
the 12C/13C ratio from their precursor species, astrochemical models were
conducted for the latter and compared with our observational results. We
conclude that an enrichment in 13C in COMs at the earliest protostellar stages
is likely inherited from the COMs' precursor species, whose 12C/13C ratios are
set during the prestellar stage via isotopic exchange reactions. This also
implies that low 12C/13C ratios observed at later evolutionary stages could at
least partially be inherited. A final conclusion on 12C/13C ratios in
protostellar environments requires improved observations to tackle current
observational limitations and additional modelling efforts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20953v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparing population synthesis models of compact double white dwarfs to

Accepted by A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context: Studies of the Galactic population of double white dwarfs (DWDs)
that would be detectable in gravitational waves by LISA have found differences
in the number of predicted detectable DWDs of more than an order of magnitude,
depending on the binary stellar evolution model used. Particularly, the binary
population synthesis code BPASS predicts 20 to 40 times fewer detectable DWDs
than the codes SeBa or BSE, which relates to differing treatments of mass
transfer and common-envelope events (CEEs).
  Aims: We aimed to investigate which of these models are closer to reality by
comparing their predictions to the DWDs known from electromagnetic
observations.
  Methods: We compared the DWDs predicted by a BPASS galaxy model and a SeBa
galaxy model to a DWD catalogue and the sample of DWDs observed by the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF), taking into account the observational limits and
biases of the ZTF survey.
  Results: We found that BPASS underpredicts the number of short-period DWDs by
at least an order of magnitude compared to the observations, while the SeBa
galaxy model is consistent with the observations for DWDs more distant than 500

invaluable information on aspects of stellar evolution such as mass transfer
and CEEs, which will allow theoretical models to be better constrained.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21359v1" target="_blank"><h2>Teleparallel dark energy in a nonflat universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rocco D'Agostino, Francesco Bajardi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 4 figures. Published in PRD</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this paper, we investigate the cosmological dynamics of teleparallel dark
energy in the presence of nonzero spatial geometry. Extending previous analyses
of nonminimal scalar-tensor theories in the torsion-based framework, we
consider different scalar field potentials and examine the resulting background
evolution and linear perturbations. Adopting a dynamical systems approach, we
reformulate the field equations and constrain the model parameters via a Markov
chain Monte Carlo analysis combining updated datasets from Pantheon+SH0ES
supernovae, cosmic chronometers, and growth rate measurements. Our results
suggest a mild preference for an open geometry, although all models remain
consistent with a flat universe at the $1\sigma$ level. Notably, Bayesian
information criteria indicate that the nonflat teleparallel scenario with a
vanishing potential is strongly favored over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.
Furthermore, all teleparallel scenarios are compatible with local
determinations of the Hubble constant and exhibit better agreement with
low-redshift structure formation data compared to $\Lambda$CDM. These findings
highlight the potential of nonflat teleparallel gravity to address current
observational tensions and motivate its further investigation as a viable
alternative to standard cosmology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21220v1" target="_blank"><h2>Wavelet Flow For Extragalactic Foreground Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M. Mebratu, W. L. K. Wu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 7 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations
are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance
to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian
statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information
extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from
current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF)
models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability
distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly
train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared
background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically
recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of
$\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of
the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly
accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of
these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each
scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These
results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated
components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological
data. Our code and trained models can be found here

  cosmology</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alex A. Saoulis, Davide Piras, Niall Jeffrey, Alessio Spurio Mancini, Ana M. G. Ferreira, Benjamin Joachimi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9+4 pages, 8+5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation
when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on
machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires
large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality
simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning,
combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of
high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter
density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS
Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations
reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a
factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior
dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper
simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on
high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21383v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries
  in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tomás Ferreira Chase, Diana López Nacir, Nicolás Yunes</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be
affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could
inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves
emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of
an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled
to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational
potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the
binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here
compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using
the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then
perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental
effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with
ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude
that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne
interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local,
vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger
than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21256v1" target="_blank"><h2>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial
  black holes or companion stars?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Heinrich Steigerwald</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages + 9 supplemental material, accepted by PRD Letters, comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the
form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars.
These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the
ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to
cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar
masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution
pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations
for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so
far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find
no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is
unpredicted from first principles.</p></br></body>
