significant unsolved problem in astrophysics, particularly in the low-mass
regime, where observations are sparse. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO),
with its diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution UV-optical
spectroscopy, presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of
massive black holes (MBHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies. We propose a program to
dynamically detect quiescent MBHs with masses as low as $10^{4.5} \, \rm
M_\odot$ in galaxies within $10-30$ Mpc, by resolving stellar velocity
dispersions down to 30 $\rm km \, s^{-1}$. This effort will dramatically extend
current black hole-host galaxy scaling relations into the dwarf regime, probing
the fundamental connection between black hole seeds and their environments.
Using a volume-limited sample of $\sim 100$ dwarf galaxies drawn from existing
catalogs, HWO will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of MBHs and
enable precision measurements of stellar kinematics via Ca II triplet
absorption lines. These observations will test predictions from competing seed
formation scenarios -- light seeds from Population III remnants versus heavy
seeds from direct collapse -- and clarify whether dwarf galaxies retain
imprints of their initial black hole population. The results will offer
critical insight into SMBH formation channel and the co-evolution of black
holes and galaxies across cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01593v1" target="_blank"><h2>DESI DR2 reference mocks: clustering results from Uchuu-BGS and LRG</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  E.

reproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering
statistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red
galaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy
sample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo
abundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which
follows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of
$8\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Using SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r<19.5$)
galaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and
luminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\rm r}\leq 20$). Furthermore, we
analyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each
tracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately
reproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\%
agreement for separations of $1<r<20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\% for
$0.1<r<1\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the Uchuu-LRG mock, we successfully
captured the stellar mass dependence of clustering, while for the Uchuu-BGS
mock, we replicated the clustering for various volume-limited subsamples. We
also find good agreement between the data and mocks in the dependence of
large-scale bias on luminosity for BGS-BRIGHT galaxies and on stellar mass for
LRGs. Altogether, these results equip DESI with robust tools for generating
high-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey, thereby enhancing our
understanding of the galaxy--halo connection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01115v1" target="_blank"><h2>The luminosity history of fading local quasars over 10$^{4-5}$ years as

large (tens of kpc) extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The study is based
on large-format integral field spectroscopic observations conducted with the
Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The
spatially resolved kinematics of the ionized gas and stellar components show
signs of rotation, bi-conical outflows, and complex behavior likely associated
with past interactions. Analysis of the physical conditions of the EELRs
indicates that in these systems, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is the
primary ionization source. Using radiative transfer simulations, we compare the
ionization state across the EELRs to estimate the required AGN bolometric
luminosities at different radial distances. Then, considering the projected
light travel time, we reconstruct the inferred AGN luminosity curves. We find
that all sources are consistent with a fading trend in intrinsic AGN luminosity
by 0.2--3 dex over timescales of 40,000--80,000 years, with a time dependence
consistent with previous studies of fading AGNs. These results support the
hypothesis that most AGN undergo significant fluctuations in their accretion
rates over multiple timescales ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, as
proposed by existing theoretical models. These results provide new insights
into the transient phases of AGN activity at previously unexplored scales and
their potential long-term impact on their host galaxies through various
feedback mechanisms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01798v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematic Distortions of the High-Redshift Universe as Seen from Quasar
  Proper Motions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Valeri V. Makarov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Author's version of the paper published in Nature Astronomy on July 3, 2025 much extended with additional information on validation/verification, methodology, technical implementation</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Advances in optical astrometry allow us to infer the non-radial kinematic
structure of the Universe directly from observations. Here I use a supervised
machine learning neural network method to predict 1.57 million redshifts based
on several photometric and metadata classifier parameters from the unWISE
mid-infrared database and from Gaia. These estimates are used to divide the
sample into three redshift bins: 1-2, 2-3, and $>3$. For each subset, all
available Gaia proper motions are used in a global vector spherical harmonic
solution to degree 3 (30 fitting vector functions). I find significant
differences in a few fitted proper motion patterns at different redshifts. The
largest signals are seen in the comparison of the vector spherical harmonic
fits for the 1-2 and 2-3 redshift bins. The significant harmonics include a
rigid spin, a dipole glide from the north Galactic pole to the south and an
additional quadrupole distortion. Validation tests with filtered subsamples
indicate that the detected effect can be caused by hidden systematic errors in
astrometry. The results are verified by using an independent source of
redshifts and computing the observer's Galactocentric acceleration. This study
offers a new observational test of alternative cosmological models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01549v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS): A comparison between sub-mm and

connection between dense gas and star formation. We use data from the Close AGN
Reference Survey (CARS) to investigate the dense gas - star formation relation
in AGN hosting galaxies, and the use of dense gas as an active galactic nuclei
(AGN) diagnostic. Our sample contains five Type-1 (unobscured) AGN that were
observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the
aim to detect HCN(4-3), HCO$^+$(4-3) and CS(7-6). We detect the dense gas
emission required for this analysis in 3 of the 5 targets. We find that despite
the potential impact from the AGN on the line fluxes of these sources, they
still follow the $L_{\rm IR}-L_{\rm HCN}$ relation. We then go on to test
claims that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS line ratios can be used as a tool to
classify AGN in the sub-mm HCN diagram. We produce the classic ionised
emission-line ratio diagnostics (the so-called BPT diagrams), using available
CARS data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We then compare
the BPT classification with the sub-mm classification made using the dense gas
tracers. Where it was possible to complete the analysis we find general
agreement between optical and sub-mm classified gas excitation mechanisms. This
suggests that AGN can contribute to the excitation of both the low density gas
in the warm ionised medium and the high density gas in molecular clouds
simultaneously, perhaps through X-ray, cosmic ray or shock heating mechanisms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01014v1" target="_blank"><h2>The BoRG-$JWST$ Survey: Analogs at $z\sim8$ to the UV-luminous Galaxy

including the so-called "blue monsters", has been difficult to reconcile with
standard galaxy evolution models. To shed light on this extraordinary
population, we study the $z\sim8$ galaxies discovered by the BoRG-$JWST$
survey. These slightly-lower redshift analogs are comparable in UV luminosity
to the blue monsters, and their lower redshift makes it much easier to access
key rest frame optical diagnostics with NIRspec. We find that BoRG-$JWST$
galaxies are consistent with being dust-poor based on their blue UV slopes and
Balmer decrement ratios. We find no strong evidence for dominant active
galactic nuclei contribution to the UV brightness, based on line-ratio
diagnostics, though some contribution cannot be excluded. We further infer the
stellar mass, star formation and UV-brightness history of the BoRG-$JWST$
galaxies by fitting their rest-frame UV-optical spectra. We see evidence for
stochastic episodes of star formation for all the BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies,
providing a temporal boosting of UV luminosity in short timescales. The
UV-bright blue monsters at $z\gtrsim10$ can be explained by the presence of
stars with ages below 100 Myr.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01814v1" target="_blank"><h2>Where are all the dark galaxies? Predicting galaxy/halo locations from
  their bright neighbors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alice Chen, Niayesh Afshordi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Astronomical objects in our universe that are too faint to be directly
detectable exist and are important - an obvious example being dark matter. The
same can also apply to very faint baryonic objects, such as low luminosity
dwarf galaxies and gravitationally compact objects (e.g., rogue planets, white
dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, dark sirens). While they are very difficult
to observe directly, they have locations that are highly important when
studying astrophysical phenomena. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm
known as symbolic regression to model the probability of a dark object's
existence as a function of their separation distances to their closest two
``bright" (directly observable) neighbors, and the distances of these bright
objects to each other. An advantage of this algorithm is that it is
interpretable by humans and can be used to make reproducible predictions.
Galaxies with masses above $10^9 M_{\odot}$ and halos above $10^{12} M_{\odot}
$ are the objects that we separate into ``bright" and ``dark" to be used in our
analysis. We find that it is possible to predict the density of dark objects
using an analytic expression that depends on their distances to their closest
bright neighbors in Illustris-TNG galaxy formation simulations, which is
significantly better than the (linear) scale-dependent biasing prediction for
$k \sim 1.0~ h$Mpc$^{-1}$ (and potentially beyond, if allowed by the
resolution). This could potentially open the avenue for finding dark objects
based on their vicinity to directly observable bright sources and make future
surveys more targeted and efficient.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01293v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Evolutionary Pathway of Low-mass Supermassive Black Holes at

their host galaxies at different redshifts is crucial for unraveling the
processes of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. We present the properties of nine type 1
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate redshift ($2<z<4$) using the JWST
Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). All of them show the significant
$\mathrm{H\alpha}$ broad line and the AGN contribution in spectral energy
distribution. Our sample covers SMBH masses of $10^{6.1-8.2}\ M_\odot$ and
stellar masses of $10^{9.3-11.0}\ M_\odot$, comparable to those of the AGNs
observed in the local universe. In the low-mass SMBH regime ($<10^{8}\
M_\odot$), the BH-to-stellar mass ratios in our sample ($0.01-0.1\%$) differ
from those of the AGNs at $z>4$ ($1-10\%$), suggesting that black holes and
galaxies may trace different evolutionary pathways at intermediate and high
redshift. We also perform 2D image decomposition using GALFIT to constrain the
bulge mass by evaluating the bulge contribution in the rest-frame near-infrared
flux. We identify the AGNs with low BH-to-bulge mass ratios compared to those
observed in the nearby bulge-dominant galaxies. This finding suggests the
existence of a galaxy-first evolutionary path, in which bulge formation occurs
before substantial gas is efficiently accreted onto the central engine.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01943v1" target="_blank"><h2>ML-Driven Strong Lens Discoveries: Down to $θ_E \sim 0.03''$ and

Banka</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 73 pages, 46 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), Euclid (abstract), AGN (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present results on extending the strong lens discovery space down to much
smaller Einstein radii ($\theta_E\lesssim0.03''$) and much lower halo mass
($M_\mathrm{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) through the combination of JWST observations
and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we forecast detectable strong
lenses with JWST using CosmoDC2 as the lens catalog, and a source catalog down
to 29th magnitude. By further incorporating the VELA hydrodynamical simulations
of high-redshift galaxies, we simulate strong lenses. We train a ResNet on
these images, achieving near-100\% completeness and purity for ``conventional"
strong lenses ($\theta_E\gtrsim 0.5''$), applicable to JWST, HST, the Roman
Space Telescope and Euclid VIS. For the first time, we also search for very low
halo mass strong lenses ($M_{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) in simulations, with
$\theta_E\ll 0.5''$, down to the best resolution ($0.03''$) and depth
(10,000~sec) limits of JWST using ResNet. A U-Net model is employed to pinpoint
these small lenses in images, which are otherwise virtually impossible for
human detection. Our results indicate that JWST can find $\sim 17$/deg$^2$ such
low-halo-mass lenses, with the locations of $\sim 1.1$/deg$^2$ of these
detectable by the U-Net at $\sim100$\% precision (and $\sim 7.0$/deg$^2$ at a
99.0\% precision). To validate our model for finding ``conventional" strong
lenses, we apply it to HST images, discovering two new strong lens candidates
previously missed by human classifiers in a crowdsourcing project (Garvin et
al. 2022). This study demonstrates the (potentially ``superhuman") advantages
of ML combined with current and future space telescopes for detecting
conventional, and especially, low-halo-mass strong lenses, which are critical
for testing CDM models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01096v1" target="_blank"><h2>Breaking Through the Cosmic Fog: JWST/NIRSpec Constraints on Ionizing

unknown in our understanding of cosmic reionization. Directly estimating the
escape fraction (fesc) of ionizing photons in the epoch of reionization (EoR)
is impossible, due to the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, a
high fesc leaves clear imprints in the spectrum of a galaxy, due to reduced
nebular line and continuum emission, which also leads to bluer UV continuum
slopes (betaUV). Here, we exploit the large archive of deep JWST/NIRSpec
spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive to analyze over 1'400 galaxies at 5 < zspec
< 10 and constrain their fesc based on SED fitting enhanced with a picket fence
model. We identify 71 high-confidence sources with significant fesc based on
Bayes factor analysis strongly favouring fesc > 0 over fesc = 0 solutions. We
compare the characteristics of this high-escape subset against both the parent
sample and established diagnostics including betaUV slope, O32, and SFR surface
density (SigmaSFR). For the overall sample, we find that most sources have a
low escape fraction (<1%), however, a small subset of sources seems to emit a
large number of their ionizing photons into the IGM, such that the average fesc
is found to be ~10%, as needed for galaxies to drive reionization. Although
uncertainties remain regarding recent burstiness and the intrinsic stellar
ionizing photon output at low metallicities, our results demonstrate the unique
capability of JWST/NIRSpec to identify individual LyC leakers, measure average
fesc and thus constrain the drivers of cosmic reionization.</p></br></body>
