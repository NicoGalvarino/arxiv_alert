galaxy surveys as tracers of the cosmic web and protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$.
We use maps from the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which trace
the distributions of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and IGM Ly$\alpha$ absorption
on $\simeq 4$ $h^{-1}$ cMpc scales within the same large volume. Overall, the
joint distribution of IGM absorption and LBG density is well constrained and
accurately described by a simple physical model. However, we identify several
exceptional locations exhibiting strong IGM absorption indicative of a massive
protocluster, yet no coincident overdensity of LBGs. As discussed by Newman et
al., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are
candidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy
populations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up
observations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended
region of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected
protoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \times 10^{15}~M_{\odot}$. Ly$\alpha$
emitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the
candidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no
submillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is
needed to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with
reduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and
puzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers,
whose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of
environment-dependent galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10948v1" target="_blank"><h2>LATIS: A Sample of IGM-selected Protoclusters and Protogroups at $z \sim

the intergalactic medium (IGM), providing a new window on the cosmic web at
$z\sim2.5$. A key advantage of Ly$\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the
discovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members
in spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these
maps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and
spatially coherent Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of
these are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass
$M_{\rm desc} > 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are
protogroups ($10^{13.5} < M_{\rm desc} / M_{\odot} < 10^{14}$). We estimate the
masses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are
in accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some
previously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion.
We identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We
show that the Ly$\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within
Hyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating
Gunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback
or other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this
structure as whole. The LATIS catalog represents an order-of-magnitude increase
in the number of IGM-selected protogroups and protoclusters and will enable new
investigations of the connections between galaxies and their large-scale
environments at cosmic noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10673v1" target="_blank"><h2>Roles of SN and AGN Feedback in Shaping the Baryonic Content in a Wide

semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its
enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback
mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative
(suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation),
we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas
beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a
longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the
overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25
is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR,
YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions
across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas
ejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback
becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model,
which activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a
characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift
zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG.
Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both
models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce
the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that
a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot
gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in
intermediate halo mass regimes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10805v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of Cosmic Ray-driven Outflows on Lyman-$α$ Emission in

driving warm gas outflows in galaxies. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic
simulations to investigate the impact of CR feedback on neutral hydrogen (HI)
in a $10^{11}\,M_\odot$ dark matter halo at $2<z<4$. To this end, we
post-process the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte
Carlo Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) transfer calculations. CR feedback reduces HI column
densities around young stars, thereby allowing more Lya photons to escape and
consequently offering a better match to the Lya luminosities of observed Lya
emitters. Although galaxies with CR-driven outflows have more extended HI in
the circumgalactic medium, two Lya line properties sensitive to optical depth
and gas kinematics - the location of the red peak in velocity space
($v_\mathrm{red}$) and relative strength of the blue-to-red peaks ($B/R$) -
cannot distinguish between the CR-driven and non-CR simulations. This is
because Lya photons propagate preferentially along low HI density channels
created by the ionizing radiation, thereby limiting the scattering with
volume-filling HI. In contrast, the observed low flux ratios between the valley
and peak and the surface brightness profiles are better reproduced in the model
with CR-driven outflows because the Lya photons interact more before escaping,
rather than being destroyed by dust as is the case in the non-CR simulation. We
discuss the potential cause of the paucity of sightlines in simulations that
exhibit prominent red peaks and large $v_\mathrm{red}$, which may require the
presence of more volume-filling HI.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10921v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quantifying the Active Galactic Nuclei Fraction in Cosmic Voids via

environment plays a significant role in how galaxies form and evolve and, in
particular, whether and when galaxies host an actively accreting supermassive
black hole in their center (i.e., an Active Galactic Nucleus, or AGN). One
signature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the
mid-infrared (mid-IR) when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical
photons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on
the fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the universe
(cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the universe (cosmic walls) by using ~12
years of combined multi-epoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR
variability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability-AGN
fraction among high and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their
wall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather
large and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded
detection using more traditional AGN-selection methods such as single-epoch
mid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly-recovered AGNs is larger
among galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in
the most underdense large scale structures of the universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11530v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intrinsic alignment demographics for next-generation lensing: Revealing

million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four
lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime,
we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building
a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and
redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame
colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate
-- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with
zero, across low (0.05<z<0.5) and high (0.8<z<1.55) redshifts. In order to
construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain
maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment
with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the
amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated
with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0<z<1.5, trends
in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we
measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion
paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA
signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to
direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the
colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern
and future lensing surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10652v1" target="_blank"><h2>Emulating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees with Graph Generative Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tri Nguyen, Chirag Modi, Siddharth Mishra-Sharma, L.

cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy
formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on
ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information.
Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent
neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of
merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as
FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph
structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on
merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body
simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees
with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced
using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree
accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass
and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate
its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated
trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the
stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass
relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly
from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method
for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body
simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10674v1" target="_blank"><h2>BASS. XLIX. Characterization of highly luminous and obscured AGNs: local

Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in the ultra-hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) by
Swift/BAT. Our sample comprises 21 X-ray luminous (log $L_X/{\rm
erg\,s^{-1}}>44.6$, 2-10 keV) AGNs at $z<0.6$, optically classified as Seyfert
1.9-2. Using NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, we constrain AGN
properties such as absorption column density $N_H$, photon index $\Gamma$,
intrinsic $L_X$, covering factor, and iron K$\alpha$ equivalent width. For
sources with black hole mass estimates (12/20), we find a weak correlation
between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$). Of these, six
($50\pm13\%$) lie in the $N_H$-$\lambda_{Edd}$ "forbidden region'' and exhibit
a combined higher prevalence of $N_H$ variability and outflow signatures,
suggesting a transitional phase where AGN feedback may be clearing the
obscuring material. For the 13/21 sources with multi-epoch X-ray spectra,
$82^{+6}_{-16}\%$ exhibit variability in either 2-10 keV flux
($73^{+9}_{-16}\%$) or line-of-sight $N_H$ ($33^{+15}_{-10}\%$). For the 20/21
sources with available near-UV/optical spectroscopy, we detect
[NeV]$\lambda$3426 in 17 ($85^{+5}_{-11}\%$), confirming its reliability to
probe AGN emission even in heavily obscured systems. When normalized to the
same [OIII]$\lambda$5007 peak flux as $z = 2$-$9$ narrow-line AGNs identified
with JWST, our sample exhibits significantly stronger [NeV]$\lambda$3426
emission, suggesting that high-redshift obscured AGNs may be intrinsically
weaker in [NeV]$\lambda$3426 or that [NeV]$\lambda$3426 is more challenging to
detect in those environments. The sources presented here serve as a benchmark
for high-redshift analogs, showing the potential of [NeV]$\lambda$3426 to
reveal obscured AGNs and the need for future missions to expand X-ray studies
into the high-redshift Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10681v1" target="_blank"><h2>Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the

published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key
properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes
in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line
emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly
complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z
> 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order
L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems
is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH>10^7
M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated
from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied
BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably
higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the
general trend seen in some other z > 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the
[Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection
of the [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line at z > 5 would translate to similarly high AGN
luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for
studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured

disequilibrium throughout the MW. The interaction has displaced the MW's centre
of mass, manifesting as an apparent 'reflex motion' in velocities of outer halo
stars. Often, expensive high fidelity MW--LMC simulations are required to model
these effects, though the range of model parameter spaces can be large and
complex. We investigate the ability of lower fidelity, rigid MW-LMC simulations
to reliably infer the model parameters of higher fidelity N-body and
hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in MW--LMC simulations using a
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approach. We produce and release a set of
128,000 MW--LMC rigid potentials, with stellar haloes evolved to present-day,
each adopting a unique combination of model parameters including the MW mass,
the LMC mass and the dynamical friction strength. For these simulation
parameters, we use SBI to find their posterior distributions. We find that our
SBI framework trained on rigid MW--LMC simulations is able to correctly infer
the true simulation LMC mass within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval from both
N-body and cosmological simulations when knowledge of the induced MW reflex
motion is provided as data. This motivates future applications of the presented
SBI framework to observational data, which will help constrain both MW and LMC
properties, as well as the dynamics of the MW's reflex motion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11023v1" target="_blank"><h2>If quasars form from primordial black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jeremy Mould, Adam Batten</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> for submission to Open Journal of Astrophysics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore the consequences of a novel but increasingly well-supported

OSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission.
These galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with
star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps
with typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit
low values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70
km/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses
inferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also
artificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a
direct comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate
that, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations,
high-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores
the importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier
epochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in
star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc
as found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or
