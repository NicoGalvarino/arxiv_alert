information on their evolution. We report the discovery of negative radial
gradients in the gas-phase metallicity of the narrow-line region of the nine
galaxies in the Measuring Active Galactic Nuclei Under MUSE Microscope (MAGNUM)
galaxies: Centaurus A, Circinus, IC 5063, NGC 1068, NGC 1365, NGC 1386, NGC
2992, NGC 4945, NGC 5643. From strong-line abundance relations for active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming regions, along with emission-line ratio
diagnostics, we determine spatially resolved gas-phase metallicities for the
kinematic components, galaxy disc and outflow. These relations involve
sensitive strong emission lines, specifically [O III]5007, [N II]6584,
H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, [S II]6716, and [S II]6731. The existence of predominantly
negative radial metallicity gradients in these AGN host galaxies indicates that
metals are not necessarily moved from the central regions to the outskirts by
AGN activity and that the gas-phase metallicity in galaxies may follow the
general inside-out star formation scenario.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10654v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing the interplay between Galactic star formation and

galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly
shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of
high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early
(pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified.
Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass
star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is
complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including
the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed
in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their
associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the
low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains
elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star
formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star
formation efficiency versus gas surface density, {\Sigma}gas) will allow for a
better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external
galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA,
with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric
capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback
and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10856v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence of Galactic Center Expansion from Gaia DR3 Stars along the
  South North Axis: Implications for the JWST Early Galaxy Problem</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  G. S. Karapetian, L. E. Byzalov, M. A. Hovhannisyan, L. A. Mahtessian, A. P.

massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang,
challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the
Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of
accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows
signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such
activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed
stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data.
Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points,
spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the
Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36
of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s
(N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative
velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t
test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003).
  The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative
average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away
from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region.
  These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of
massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to
other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster
motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require
refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires
further study.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10670v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation of Cosmic Noon Protogalaxies via Quasar-Induced Fragmentation

Submitted to ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), galaxy formation (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> When black hole jets encounter ambient medium, they can compress the gas,
trigger star formation, and create stellar clusters containing tens of
thousands of stars. Here, we report a remarkable discovery of such a phenomenon
that happened just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang, during the Cosmic Noon
era. Quasar SDSSJ141924.44+532315.5, powered by a one-billion-solar-mass black
hole, is seen blasting a powerful jet that interacts with a hypermassive gas
reservoir, creating a fascinating, clumpy, arc-like structure spanning over 250
kiloparsecs in projected length, consisting of at least eight clumps. Each
clump contains billions of stars, is as massive as the Milky Way, and exhibits
extreme levels of star formation. We interpret these findings as fragmentation
of a cosmic filament triggered by a jet overpressurized expanding cocoon, which
leads to the birth of protogalaxies, a process observed at scales never seen
before. We find that the physical conditions within the filament are favorable
for a fragmentation scenario to occur. We also discuss the survivability and
evolution of individual clumps in the context of unsolved galaxy formation
theory problems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10601v1" target="_blank"><h2>Active galactic nuclei do not exhibit stably periodic brightness
  variations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kareem El-Badry, David W. Hogg, Hans-Walter Rix</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 3 figures, submitted to OJAp</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been
proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries.
Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on
periodicity in their $\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia
photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the
reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that
in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model
fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than
periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false
positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false
detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at
most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day
timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain
dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so
the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most
short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple
periodicity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11111v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super

fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation
at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust
semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that
accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even
modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation
field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be
affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation,
particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our
results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where
heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of
different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of
high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12058v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterization of Two Cool Galaxy Outflow Candidates Using

mass, highly inclined Virgo cluster galaxies: NGC4424 and NGC4694. Previous
analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon
monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow
hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared
photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we
identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified
structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they
include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be
destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of
cool (T$\leq 10^4$K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for
using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass,
lower star formation galaxies.</p></br></body>
