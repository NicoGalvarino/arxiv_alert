also serve as key probes of galaxies, providing insight into their chemical
evolution and interstellar medium (ISM). Recently, a method based on Gaia
astrometric measurements has aided the selection of quasars reddened by dust
hitherto overlooked. We conducted a spectroscopic study using VLT/X-Shooter on
one such dust-reddened quasar, Q2310-3358. This quasar, at $z =
2.3908\pm0.0003$, is associated with a Damped Lyman-alpha absorber (DLA) at
nearly the same redshift $2.4007\pm0.0003$, with a neutral hydrogen column
density of $\log N(\mathrm{H\,I}) = 21.214 \pm 0.003$. The DLA is very
metal-rich (close to the Solar metallicity after correction for depletion on
dust grains). Its properties align with the metal-to-dust ratio and the
mass-metallicity relation established in previous large samples of DLAs.
Surprisingly, given its proximity to the quasar in redshift, the absorber has
strong cold gas characteristics, including CI and H$_2$. Based on the derived
kinetic temperature of $71^{+28}_{-15}$~K, we infer the presence of a strong UV
radiation field, which in turn suggests that the quasar and the DLA are in
close proximity, i.e. part of the same galaxy and not just different objects in
the same overdensity of galaxies. We use the line ratios of the CI
fine-structure lines to constrain the density of the cold gas, yielding $n_{\rm
H} \sim 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Our analysis extends the understanding of
$z_{abs} \approx z_{em}$ absorption line systems and provides valuable
constraints on the interplay between dust, metals, and neutral gas in the ISM
of early galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24357v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatial-Kinematic Absorption Models of the Circumgalactic Medium. I.

synthesizing quasar absorption line profiles from sight lines through
idealized, spatial-kinematic models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and

multiple galaxy/CGM structures and populate these structures with 3D velocity
fields. For arbitrary viewing angles and galaxy-quasar impact parameters, we
derive observer coordinate-based expressions for the perceived azimuthal angle
and galaxy inclination and a generalized scalar expression for the
line-of-sight velocity as a function of position along the line of sight. We
motivate and develop four idealized galaxy/CGM spatial-kinematic structures
based on empirical data and theoretical predictions: (1) a rotating galactic
disk/extra-planar gas, (2) a static or dynamic spherical halo, (3) an
outflowing bi-polar galactic wind, and (4) an inward spiraling flared planar
accretion. Using a small set of free parameters, the spatial geometries and
velocity fields can be adjusted and explored, including velocity gradients,
wind stalling, and accretion trajectories. These spatial-kinematic models are
designed to be flexible and easily modified and can be tailored for studying
individual galaxy-absorber pairs or galaxy group environments; they can be
applied to real-world observations or hydrodynamic simulations of the baryon
cycle as studied through quasar absorption line systems. These models also
serve as tools for developing physical intuition. In Paper II, we will present
the formalism for populating the galaxy/CGM structures with multiphase
photoionized and collisionally ionized gas and for generating absorption
profiles for ions of interest.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23803v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatial-Kinematic Absorption Models of the Circumgalactic Medium. II.

formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes.
While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited
volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations.
In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large
$(2.8$ $\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar
activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO
reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \lesssim 1$) and for faint
quasars ($L_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ $\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but
significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \approx
1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent
unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by
upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with
observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass
reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating
above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully
reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic
time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks
to FLAMINGO's large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and
measure their spatial clustering for $\log_{10} L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg
s^{-1}} \gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across
$0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by
scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the
clustering strength at $z \approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly
reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23742v1" target="_blank"><h2>Molecular Gas in Major Mergers Hosting Dual and Single AGN at <10 kpc

(ALMA) observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) or $^{12}$CO(1-0) emission in seven local
($z$ $\lesssim$ 0.05) major mergers -- five of which are dual active galactic
nuclei (AGN) systems, and two of which are single AGN systems. We model the
molecular gas kinematics through rotating disk profiles using a Bayesian Markov
chain Monte Carlo approach. The residuals were then used to isolate
non-rotating components of the molecular gas -- the most likely contributor to
future SMBH growth. We find that more massive SMBHs have higher surface
densities of non-rotating molecular gas within their sphere of influence. This
potential molecular gas supply, however, does not correlate with the current
accretion efficiency of the SMBHs, suggesting that only a fraction of the
observed non-rotating gas is currently reaching the SMBH. Finally, we
tentatively find no significant differences in the nuclear molecular gas masses
of single AGN and dual AGN hosts, both within the SMBH sphere of influence and
within the central kiloparsec. Our results indicate that the probability of
occurrence of the dual AGN phenomenon is likely dependent on AGN variability
and/or obscuration rather than the availability of molecular gas in the nuclear
regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23979v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rest-frame Optical Spectroscopy of $z \sim 2$ Quasars with Steep Hard
  X-ray Spectral Shapes: X-ray Selection of Super-Eddington Accretion and

black holes. However, identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars
observationally is challenging due to uncertain black-hole mass estimates and
other complications. The Eddington ratio parameter does not represent
accurately the accretion rate in the super-Eddington regime. On the other hand,
super-Eddington accreting quasars appear to show large hard X-ray (rest-frame >
2 keV) power-law photon indices, and they also exhibit distinct optical
spectral features including weak [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission and strong Fe
II emission. We test steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington
accreting quasars by obtaining Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope near-infrared
spectra for a pilot sample of nine $\Gamma=2.0-2.6$ quasars at
$z\approx1.4-2.5$. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole
masses (median value $\rm 4.3 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios
(median value 0.6). The Eddington ratio distribution is consistent with that of
the comparison sample, which is a flux-limited sample of quasars at
$z\approx1.5-3.5$ with near-infrared spectroscopy. But our super-Eddington
candidates do show statistically weaker [O III] emission ($P_{\rm
null}=0.0075$) and marginally stronger Fe II emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.06$). We
also find one candidate with broad (width of 1960 km/s) and blueshifted (690
km/s) [O III] $\lambda 4959$ and [O III] $\lambda 5007$ lines, which probably
originate from a strong [O III] outflow driven by super-Eddington accretion.
Overall, the steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting
quasars appears promising. But a larger sample is needed to assess further the
reliability of the selection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23741v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Spin Alignment with Tidal Fields in the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jun-Sung Moon, Teppei Okumura</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title, abstract), kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with
the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during
structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction
using the final data release of the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field spectroscopy
survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas
kinematics for nearly 10,000 galaxies. Unlike previous studies that relied on
filament orientations, we directly utilize the three-dimensional tidal field
reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined
reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align
their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent
with the prediction of the TTT. They also tend to orient perpendicular to the
major axis, hinting at the possible influence of baryonic processes. In
contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass
of $M_*\sim10^{10}-10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$. No significant alignment is detected
with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine
the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type
spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The
alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal
anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these
environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our
results provide the most direct empirical evidence to date for the connection
between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24622v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Impact of Cosmic Ray Transport on the $γ$-Ray Luminosity of

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), CGM (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of $\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to
study the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical
environments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium
(ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal
particles and produce $\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\gamma$-ray
luminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser
gas, they produce more $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different
cosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a
turbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two
quantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the
correlation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must
escape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\gamma$-ray emission and be
consistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms
(either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower
$\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of
magnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps)
is necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of
$\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the
significant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray
reacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent
reacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds
drive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result,
the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23705v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark-matter halos with

exhibit the formation of a highly dense core at the galactic center--a
gravothermal collapse. Analytic models to describe this evolution have been
developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic
particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the
theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for
gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider
self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution
but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant
anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity
distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that
assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that
these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion
profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24573v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST observations of photodissociation regions III. Dust modelling at

dominate the mid-infrared emission of photodissociation regions (PDRs). We
study the evolution of nano-grains across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead
PDR, especially their abundance and size properties. This work is part of the
Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts program studying dust and gas in PDRs with
JWST. We use NIRCam+MIRI photometric bands and NIRSpec+MRS spectroscopy to map
the illuminated edge. We model dust emission using the THEMIS dust model with
the SOC radiative transfer code. Detailed modeling of high angular resolution
JWST data allows us to obtain constraints on nano-grain properties. We find
that diffuse ISM dust cannot account for the observed data, requiring evolved
grains. A sharp density increase is observed at the illuminated edge,
consistent with ALMA observations revealing a sharp transition between
molecular and ionized gas. Although the PDR length could not be directly
determined, we estimate an upper limit of approximately 0.015 pc. This implies
a lower limit on small grain abundance (greater than 0.003), showing small
grains are not depleted at the Horsehead edge, unlike in the Orion Bar. Our
findings indicate a high-density environment and less steep size distribution
for nano-grains at the illuminated edge versus the diffuse ISM. This implies
nano-grain destruction mechanisms might be less efficient in the Horsehead's
moderate-UV field than in more intense PDRs. These results support a model
where nano-grain population recovery is slower in moderate-UV environments,
leading to a unique dust size distribution at the edge of the Horsehead Nebula.</p></br></body>
