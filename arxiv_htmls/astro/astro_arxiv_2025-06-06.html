the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics.
Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been
heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their
host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An
opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast
triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift
z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with
respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar
mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the
detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and
fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and
chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of
the neutral gas of a galaxy at z>6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines
we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as
$d_{II}=620^{+230}_{-140}$ pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column
density, $\log(N(HI)/cm^{-2})=22.5\pm0.3$, which is the highest one at z>6
determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal
column density, $\log(N(ZnII)/cm^{-2})>14.3$. The observed metallicity of the
host galaxy system is [Zn/H]>-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust
depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are
saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust
depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very
high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build
up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be
common features of galaxies in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04310v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent

Weisz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A; 14 pages, 9 figures (excluding appendices)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive
($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the
JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved
kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our
measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line
spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source
morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are
orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10
galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 =
180-387$km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter.
The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain
their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample
indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early
massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with
other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between
rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more
rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and
likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support
compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our
kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These
dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median
$M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in
the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a
scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs,
gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due
to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04119v2" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics

galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number
densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive
($\rm M_*> 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies from $z=2-7$ in over 800
arcmin$^2$ of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a
total area $>$ 5 $\times$ previous JWST studies). We compute and report their
cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass
density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies
relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and
semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce
our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but
that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We
find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive
quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval $z=2-5$. This shows that
none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy
quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater
abundance of lower-mass ($\rm M_*<10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies than
previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple
colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside
individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the
observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper
increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than
has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from
$z=4.5$ to $z=2$, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching
within these epochs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04350v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho, Kohei Inayoshi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 16 figures, and 2 tables. Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and
compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z >= 4 known as Little Red Dots
(LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad
Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we
present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of
five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected
from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra
covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that
approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show
red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line
emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to
have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are
dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact
star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs).
Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black
hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them
at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of
super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate
significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes
appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but
consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn
relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line
AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03836v1" target="_blank"><h2>An independent estimate of H(z) at z = 0.5 from the stellar ages of
  brightest cluster galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S. Ilani Loubser, Adebusola B. Alabi, Matt Hilton, Yin-Zhe Ma, Xin Tang, Narges Hatamkhani, Catherine Cress, Rosalind E. Skelton, S. Andile Nkosi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Several cosmological observations (e.g., Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
Supernovae Type Ia, and local distance ladder measurements such as Cepheids)
have been used to measure the global expansion rate of the Universe, i.e., the
Hubble constant, $H_{0}$. However, these precision measurements have revealed
tensions between different probes that are proving difficult to solve.
Independent, robust techniques must be exploited to validate results or
mitigate systematic effects. We use the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) method, which
leverages the differential age evolution of passive galaxies, to measure
$H(z)$, without any assumption of the underlying cosmology. Unlike previous CC
studies, we used only brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the oldest and most
massive galaxies in the Universe, to construct a pure and homogeneous sample.
In this work we used a sample of 53 BCGs in massive, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
selected galaxy clusters (0.3 $< z <$ 0.7) with Southern African Large
Telescope (SALT) spectroscopic observations. We used optical spectra to measure
D4000$_{\rm n}$ of the BCGs to obtain a new direct measurement of $H(z) = 72.1
\pm 33.9(\rm stat) \pm 7.3$(syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0.5$. By using
BCGs, we significantly reduced the systematic errors to 10% by minimising the
stellar mass and metallicity dependence of the method. The dominant
uncertainty, and limitation for our study, is statistical, and we need larger,
homogeneous samples of the oldest, most massive galaxies. By using the
$Planck$+BAO prior of $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, the projected Hubble
constant is $H_{0}$ = $54.6 \pm 25.7(\rm stat) \pm 5.5$(syst) km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with both CMB and Cepheid measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04201v1" target="_blank"><h2>Analyzing Line-of-sight selection biases in galaxy-scale strong lensing

will dramatically increase the number of strong gravitational lensing systems,
requiring precise modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) effects to mitigate biases in
lensing observations and cosmological inferences. We develop a method to
construct joint distributions of external convergence ($\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$)
and shear ($\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$) for strong lensing LOS by aggregating
large-scale structure simulations with high-resolution halo renderings and
non-linear correction. Our approach captures both smooth background matter and
perturbations from halos, enabling accurate modeling of LOS effects. We apply
non-linear LOS corrections to $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ and
$\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$ that address the non-additive lensing effects caused by
objects along the LOS in strong lensing. We find that, with a minimum image
separation of $1.0^{\prime\prime}$, non-linear LOS correction due to the
presence of a dominant deflector slightly increases the ratio of quadruple to
double lenses; this non-linear LOS correction also introduces systematic biases
of $\sim 0.1\%$ for galaxy-AGN lenses in the inferred Hubble constant ($H_0$)
if not accounted for. We also observe a $0.66\%$ bias for galaxy-galaxy lenses
on $H_0$, and even larger biases up to $1.02\%$ for galaxy-AGN systems if LOS
effects are not accounted for. These results highlight the importance of LOS
for precision cosmology. The publicly available code and datasets provide tools
for incorporating LOS effects in future analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04757v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modelling the selection of galaxy groups with end to end simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R.

its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their
binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The
XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray
(ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical
simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is
essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling
the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu
simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a
neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching
observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population.
Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray
luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a
velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is
driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and
redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We
calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation
and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about
0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich
systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for
groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray
follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing
completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors
dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the
comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups
and hydro simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04186v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Correlation Between FRB Dispersion Measure and Foreground Large-Scale

question in astronomy, and the dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs) serves as a valuable tool for probing this cosmic gas. We investigate
the impact of the foreground cosmic web on FRB DMs using 61 localized FRBs and
public galaxy catalogs. We test for the large-scale structure's impact on
cosmological DM using two methods. First, we searched for a correlation between
galaxy number density along the line of sight and extragalactic DM, and found a
statistically significant positive correlation ($p$ = $1.76 \times 10^{-5}$).
The shape of this correlation contains information about the cosmic baryon
distribution, and can also be used to better constrain host galaxy DM by
providing an estimate of the cosmic contribution on a per-source basis. We
observe similar correlations in a mock FRB survey based on the IllustrisTNG
cosmological simulation, where the DM is dominated by filaments in the IGM and
not by halos. Next, we performed a stacking analysis that measures the average
excess DM as a function of impact parameter of foreground galaxies to obtain
spatial information about how ionized gas is distributed around galaxy halos.
We report excess DM in the stacked signal for impact parameters up to Mpc
scales ($\sim$3$\sigma$). Finally, we identified FRBs that do not appear to
intersect intervening halos within $r_{vir}$, allowing us to estimate the
fraction of baryons that reside in the IGM. We find $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} \geq
0.69$ at 95$\%$ confidence, indicating significant astrophysical feedback.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04819v1" target="_blank"><h2>Model selection using the HII galaxy Hubble diagram</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jun-Jie Wei, Fulvio Melia</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions
(GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond
the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support
recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated
sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to $z\sim
7.5$, mapping the Universe's expansion over $95\%$ of its current age. In this
{\it Letter} we use these sources for model selection, and show that the
$R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is strongly favored by this probe over both
flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion
probabilities of, respectively, $91.8\%$, $7.4\%$ and $0.8\%$. A possible
caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm
int}$, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons.
We find that the inclusion of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ as an additional, optimizable
parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ about
equal, though at the expense of creating $\sim 2.5\sigma$ tension between our
inferred matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and its {\it Planck}-optimized value.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03970v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Relativistic Jet in the Radio Quiet AGN Mrk 110</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ailing Wang, Tao An, Kenneth I.

Seyfert 1 galaxy historically classified as a radio-quiet active galactic
nucleus (AGN). Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations reveal
intermittent jet activity during 2015--2016 and 2022--2024, with proper motion
measurements yielding superluminal velocities of $\sim3.6\pm0.6\,c$ and
$\sim2.1\pm0.2\,c$, respectively. The recent jet component decelerates to $\sim
1.5\pm0.2\,c$ at a projected distance of 1.1 parsec from the core, coinciding
with the transition zone between broad-line and narrow-line regions. This
deceleration accompanies dramatic spectral evolution from steep (the spectral
index $\alpha \approx -0.63 \pm 0.04$) to inverted ($\alpha \approx +0.69 \pm
0.10$) as the 7.6 GHz flux density more than doubled. These episodic jet
ejections and their evolutionary pattern match theoretical predictions from
magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models for temporary jet formation in systems
with Mrk 110's physical parameters on timescales of months to years. The
observed jet deceleration distance matches expectations for relativistic
outflows interacting with the circumnuclear environment. These findings
demonstrate that the traditional radio-loud/quiet AGN dichotomy may reflect
time-averaged states rather than intrinsic capabilities, suggesting that jets
may form across the AGN population but become observable only during specific
accretion phases when MAD conditions are temporarily established. Mrk 110
serves as a critical "missing link" between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN,
providing insight into jet formation mechanisms, environmental interactions,
and physical processes that unify various AGN classifications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04334v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical evolution of self-gravitating halos of self-interacting dark

Code QSOLbol is available at this https URLthis https URL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured,
type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a
fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from
monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect
quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have
multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a
well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this
fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations
with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network
self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the
bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces
systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we
update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and
monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}.
Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of
luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have

Joshi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> published in New Astronomy, 14 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported
with reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and
properties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced
by these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar
extinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b <= 6 deg,
corresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane
characterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude.
By splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic
longitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with
the formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic
mid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at
approximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude.
Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of
interstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material
below the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc
above the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the
reddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of
the absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average
extent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to
be about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of
interstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its
implications for the Galactic structure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03536v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the Baryon Fraction in the Intergalactic Medium with 92

constraining the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM), offering a
promising avenue to address the missing baryon problem. In this paper, we
analyze constraints on the IGM baryon fraction ($f_\mathrm{IGM}$) using 92
localized FRBs, incorporating a corrected probability distribution function for
the IGM dispersion measure within three different cosmological models. We find
that variations in the underlying cosmological model have a negligible impact
on the inferred values of $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. While the NE2001 Galactic electron
density model yields slightly higher $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ values compared to the
YMW16 model, the results are consistent within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level.
Additionally, there is no statistically significant evidence for redshift
evolution in $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. Our analysis constrains $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ to the

Group Galaxies (BGGs) from redshift $z \simeq 0.08$ to $z = 3.7$ using the
\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}'s 255h COSMOS-Web program. This survey
provides deep NIRCam imaging in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W)
across $\sim 0.54~\mathrm{deg}^2$ and MIRI coverage in $\sim
0.2~\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. High-resolution NIRCam imaging enables
robust size and morphological measurements, while multiwavelength photometry
yields stellar masses, SFRs, and S\'ersic parameters. We classify BGGs as
star-forming and quiescent using both rest-frame NUV--$r$--$J$ colors and a
redshift-dependent specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold. Our analysis
reveals: (1) quiescent BGGs are systematically more compact than their
star-forming counterparts and exhibit steeper size--mass slopes; (2) effective
radii evolve as $R_e \propto (1+z)^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha = 1.11 \pm 0.07$
(star-forming) and $1.40 \pm 0.09$ (quiescent); (3) star formation surface
density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) increases with redshift and shows stronger
evolution for massive BGGs ($\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.75$); (4) in the
$\Sigma_*$--sSFR plane, a structural transition marks the quenching process,
with bulge-dominated systems comprising over 80\% of the quiescent population.
These results highlight the co-evolution of structure and star formation in
BGGs, shaped by both internal and environmental processes, and establish BGGs
as critical laboratories for studying the baryonic assembly and morphological
transformation of central galaxies in group-scale halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04004v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lonely Little Red Dots: Challenges to the AGN-nature of little red dots

unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs).
We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift
range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF,
JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models
with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on
the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find
that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components
is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC
suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially
when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field,
JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and
galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find
that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at
all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper
limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst
the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent
populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting
compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04747v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Centre of Attention: a Powerful Radio Galaxy Pinpoints a NIR-Dark

Turner</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report the discovery of a $z\sim3.9$ protocluster identified from Atacama
Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array Band 3 spectral scans of a bright radio
source selected from the GaLactic and Extra-galactic All-sky Murchison
Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. Extended CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) line emission
was detected in GLEAM J005332$-$325630 confirming it to be a $z=3.879$ powerful
radio galaxy with luminosity, $L_{500 MHz}=1.3\times10^{28}$ ${W Hz}^{-1}$.
This source is part of a sample of candidate high redshift radio galaxies with
bright radio fluxes, $S_{150MHz}>0.1$ Jy, but host galaxies with
$K_s({AB})\gtrsim23$ mag. The molecular gas associated with the radio galaxy
host has two kinematically separate components, likely in-falling and
indicative of a recent interaction or merger with another galaxy. One 100-GHz
continuum source $\sim120$ pkpc away is found to have both CO(4-3) and
[CI](1-0) emission lines and a further five protocluster members are identified
from CO(4-3) emission alone, all at similar redshift ($\Delta v<700$ km
s$^{-1}$) and within a radius of $1.1^{\prime}$. Using photometry from the High
Acuity Widefield K-band Imager $K_s$-band and the Dark Energy Survey $g, r, i,
z$ and $Y$ bands, we find this protocluster harbours a rare, optically-dark,
very massive $M_*\sim10^{12}$ ${M}_\odot$ galaxy. Comparisons with the TNG300
cosmological simulation puts this galaxy in a dark matter halo of
$M_{DM}\sim3\times10^{13}$ ${M}_\odot$ which will evolve into a Coma-like DM
halo ($M_{DM}\sim10^{15}$ ${M}_\odot$) by the present day.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04457v1" target="_blank"><h2>A systematic search for AGN obscuration variability in the Chandra

Gianolli, Xiurui Zhao, Marco Ajello, Indrani Pal, Ross Silver</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be
studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm
H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long
periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few
selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option
currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival
data. In this work, we estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the
local $(z<0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations
($54\pm11$%), indicative of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability. Interestingly, we also
find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 ($f_{\rm
Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}$%) and Seyfert 2 ($f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15$%) galaxies,
and discuss why we might find a slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$. We also present
a sample of 43 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies with multiple Chandra
observations whose properties make them promising $N_{\rm H,los}$-variable
targets. We discuss the accuracy of our method, and search for potential
dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation
pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find
evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter
timescales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04570v1" target="_blank"><h2>RIDEN pilot survey: broad-band selection of candidate quasars with
  extended Lyman-$α$ nebulae using CLAUDS-HSC-SSP-DUNES$^2$ joint data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rhythm Shimakawa, Satoshi Kikuta, Haruka Kusakabe, Marcin Sawicki, Yongming Liang, Rieko Momose, Stephen Gwyn, Guillaume Desprez</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST), delivering deep, multi-band ($ugrizy$) imaging data across 18,000
square degrees over the next decade. Before this ultra-wide-field survey, we
constructed a broad-band Ly$\alpha$ imaging toward 483 SDSS/BOSS quasars at
$z=$ 1.9-3.0, using deep, wide-field ultraviolet to near-infrared ($u$-to-$K$)
data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey (HSC-SSP), the CFHT
Large Area U-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS), the Deep UKIRT Near-Infrared Steward
Survey (DUNES$^2$), and additional public data covering 13 square degrees. Our
broad-band selection allowed us to select 24 candidate quasar nebulae that
exhibit $u$ or $g$ band excess over 50-170 kpc, some of which exhibit
asymmetrical extended features similar to those seen in previously discovered
giant nebulae. We then investigated whether the Ly$\alpha$ morphology of quasar
nebulae differs between two redshift intervals, $z=$ 1.9-2.3 and $z=$ 2.3-3.0,
and examined environmental dependence based on a control sample. Comparison
results show no significant difference in asymmetry within Ly$\alpha$ nebulae
between the two redshift intervals. Furthermore, we found no systematic
differences in overdensities around the complete quasar samples, quasars with
large Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, and control samples, while the most extended nebula
appears to be located in the high-density region. Further verification analyses
are required since the current dataset lacks spectroscopic confirmation for
both quasar nebulae and their surrounding neighbours. Nevertheless, the results
demonstrate the great potential of the Rubin LSST to discover giant Ly$\alpha$
nebulae on an unprecedented scale.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04336v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulation-based inference of galaxy properties from JWST pixels</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Patricia Iglesias-Navarro, Marc Huertas-Company, Pablo Pérez-González, Johan H. Knapen, ChangHoon Hahn, Anton M. Koekemoer, Steven L. Finkelstein, Natalia Villanueva, Andrés Asensio Ramos</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to
multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic
Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid
posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial
resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is
trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models,
incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and
JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference
approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior
distributions, with an $R^2$ score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our
pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar
population properties down to $\mathrm{S/N}_{\rm{pixel}}=5$ (averaged over
F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with
spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or
starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural
assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and
integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass
galaxies ($<10^8M_{\odot}$) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to
SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of $10^{-4}$ seconds per
pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model
offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population
properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at
sub-galactic scales.</p></br></body>
