serve as the massive halo counterpart of the modern cosmological galaxy
evolution framework. The zoom-in simulation targets a volume of $4.1\sigma$
overdensity region, which is expected to evolve into a galaxy cluster with a
virial mass of $5 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, comparable to that of the Virgo
Cluster. The zoom-in volume extends out to 3.5 virial radii from the central
halo. The novelties of NewCluster are found in its resolutions. Its stellar
mass resolution of $2 \times 10^{4} M_\odot$ is effective for tracing the early
assembly of massive galaxies as well as the formation of dwarf galaxies. The
spatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the
adaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic
structure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also
exceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the
physical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion
within a larger halo. The simulation has up-to-date feedback schemes for
supernovae and active galactic nuclei. The chemical evolution is calculated for
ten elements, along with dust calculation that includes the formation, size
change, and destruction. To overcome the limitations of the Eulerian approach
used for gas dynamics in this study, we employ Monte Carlo-based tracer
particles in NewCluster, enabling a wide range of scientific investigations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06443v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intergalactic Medium Tomography with the Sunburst Arc</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Michelle A.

intergalactic medium (IGM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM). Here we use the
brightest lensed galaxy identified to date, the Sunburst Arc
($z$$\approx$2.37), to constrain the physical size of foreground absorbers at
$z$$\approx$2 in 2D. This galaxy is a confirmed Lyman continuum leaker, where
its single leaking region is imaged 12 times over four separate arcs. The
separations between the arcs allows for large scale tomography, while the
distances between the images along an arc allow for small scale tomography.
Using HST/WFC3 UVIS G280 grism observations, we extracted the spectra of the
leaking region and fit for absorbers detected along these lines of sight using
a binary population and spectral synthesis (BPASS) model for the galaxy. We
identified two partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs) and one Lyman limit system
(LLS) across the different spectra and measured their physical sizes. We find
consistent HI column densities across $\lesssim$2 kpc and an average HI mass of
$\approx$10$^3$ ${\rm M}_\odot$ for the absorbers. Given the strong CIV lines
associated with two of the absorbers, they are likely located within the CGM of
foreground galaxies. The third absorber has no associated metal lines, so it is
most likely within the IGM. This study provides the first tomography
measurements of pLLSs/LLSs in the CGM and IGM at $z$$\approx$2.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06375v1" target="_blank"><h2>The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: An integral field unit-based integrated

properties, but also of the interstellar medium (in particular the molecular
phase) out of which stars form, using a statistically significant and unbiased
sample of galaxies. To this end, we introduce here the integrated Extragalactic
Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), a collection of integrated stellar and
nebular emission lines, and molecular gas properties from 643 galaxies in the
local Universe. These galaxies are drawn from the CALIFA datasets, and are
followed up in CO lines by the APEX, CARMA, and ACA telescopes. As this
database is assembled from data coming from a heterogeneous set of telescopes
(including IFU optical data and single-dish and interferometric CO data), we
adopted a series of techniques (tapering, spatial and spectral smoothing, and
aperture correction) to homogenise the data. Due to the application of these
techniques, the database contains measurements from the inner regions of the
galaxies and for the full galaxy extent. We used the database to study the
fundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR),
stellar mass ($M_*$), and molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) across galaxies
with different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these
quantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from
spiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction
($f_{\rm mol}=M_{\rm mol}/M_*$) decreases homogeneously across these two types
of galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\rm mol}$) in the inner
regions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to
the global values. This indicates that inside-out quenching requires not only
low $f_{\rm mol}$, but also strongly reduced SFE in the galactic centres.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06709v1" target="_blank"><h2>The EDGE-CALIFA survey: The effect of active galactic nucleus feedback

from active star-forming states to retired ones, remains a complex phenomenon
that requires further investigation. This study investigates the role of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating star formation by analyzing a sample of
643 nearby galaxies with redshifts between 0.005 and 0.03 from the Calar Alto
Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Galaxies were classified according
to the Quenching Stages and Nuclear Activity (QueStNA) scheme, which
categorizes them based on their quenching stage and the presence of nuclear
activity. We further utilized the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy
Evolution (iEDGE), which combined homogenized optical integral field unit and
CO observations. This allowed us to examine how AGNs influence the molecular
gas reservoirs of active galaxies compared to their non-active counterparts at
similar evolutionary stages. Our Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squared tests
indicate that the star formation property distributions and scaling relations
of AGN hosts are largely consistent with those of non-active galaxies. However,
AGN hosts exhibit systematically higher molecular gas masses across all
quenching stages except for the quiescent nuclear ring stage. We find that AGN
hosts follow the expected trends of non-active quenching galaxies,
characterized by a lower star formation efficiency and molecular gas fraction
compared to star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that signatures of
instantaneous AGN feedback are not prominent in the global molecular gas and
star formation properties of galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06696v1" target="_blank"><h2>Blowing Star Formation Away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- IV. Serendipitous

enabled the discovery of a surprising number of UV-bright galaxies at
$z\sim10-14$. Their number density is still relatively uncertain, due to cosmic
variance effects, and the limited survey area with deep imaging. Here, we
combine pure parallel imaging from the PANORAMIC survey with data from legacy
fields to constrain the bright end (M$_{\rm UV}<-18.5$) of the UV luminosity
function (UVLF) over $0.28\,$deg$^2$ of NIRCam imaging in 6 or more filters,
and along 35 independent lines of sight. Using conservative color selections,
we compile robust dropout samples at $z\sim10$, $z\sim13$, and $z\sim17$, and
identify 16 new candidates from PANORAMIC. Our inferred UVLFs at $z\sim10$ are
consistent with literature results and we confirm the high abundance of
galaxies at the bright end (M$_{\rm UV}\lesssim-21$) with better number
statistics. We find somewhat lower number densities at $z\sim13$ compared to
previous studies, and no robust candidates at $z\sim17$, indicating a rapid
evolution of the galaxy population from $z\sim10-17$. The improved upper limits
at $z\sim17$ imply that the cosmic UV luminosity density drops by at least a
factor $\sim50$ from $z\sim10$ to $z\sim17$. Comparing our results to models
proposed to explain the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, we
conclude that a modest increase in the star formation efficiency, or in the
burstiness of star formation, a more top-heavy initial mass function, a lack of
dust attenuation, or a combination of these effects at $z\gtrsim10$, is
sufficient to match our observational constraints.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06793v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially resolved H$α$ emission in B14-65666: compact starbursts,

of B14-65666, a Lyman-break and interacting galaxy at redshift $z$=7.15. We
detect the H$\alpha$ line emission in this system, revealing a
spatially-resolved structure of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas, which consists of
two distinct galaxies, E and W, at a projected distance of 0.4". Galaxy E is
very compact in the rest-frame UV, while W galaxy is more extended, showing a
clumpy structure reminiscent of a tidal tail. The total H$\alpha$ luminosity
implies that the system is forming stars at a Star Formation Rate (SFR) of
76$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 30$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for E and W,
respectively. The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range
measured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the
H$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W
galaxies in the $\log(\zeta_\mathrm{ion}$) $-$ EW (H$\alpha$) plane, indicate
that the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population.
The overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young
stellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and
very different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify
the two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the
ionized gas traced by the H$\alpha$ line show a velocity difference of 175
$\pm$ 28 km s$^{-1}$ between the two components of B14-65666. The in-depth
study of systems like B14-65666 reveal how galaxy mergers in the early Universe
drive intense star formation, shape the interstellar medium, and influence the
buildup of stellar mass, just 700 $-$ 800 Myr after the Big Bang.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06406v1" target="_blank"><h2>The EDGE-CALIFA survey: Star formation relationships for galaxies at

cessation of it, also called star formation quenching. In this paper, we
present star formation scaling relations for galaxies at different evolutionary
stages. To do so, we used the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy
Evolution (iEDGE), which collects CO, optical continuum, and emission line
information for 643 galaxies from the CALIFA IFU dataset. By considering the
patterns described by star-forming and retired regions, we grouped the galaxies
into quenching stages using the emission line classification scheme, QueStNA.
We observed that the molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) decreases from
star-forming to retired systems and so does the molecular-to-stellar mass ratio
($f_{\rm mol}$). In contrast, star formation efficiency (SFE) is constant in
the quenching stages dominated by star formation and rapidly declines
afterwards. We observed that this rapid decline is more pronounced in the
centre of the galaxies compared to the rest of the discs, reflecting the
inside-out quenching displayed by nearby galaxies. We noticed that the
relations between $M_{\rm mol}$ and the stellar mass ($M_*$) become
increasingly shallow with the quenching stages; however, the relations between
the star formation rate (SFR) and $M_{\rm mol}$ steepen when going from
star-forming to retired systems. We observed that a three-dimensional relation
between SFR, $M_*$, and $M_{\rm mol}$ exists for star-forming galaxies, while
data points from other quenching groups are scattered across the parameter
space. Taken together, these pieces of evidence indicate that the quenching of
the galaxies cannot be explained solely by a depletion of the molecular gas and
that a significant decrease in the SFE is necessary to retire the centre of the
galaxies beyond the star formation green valley.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06781v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): from filaments to voids, how extreme

Using data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the filament
catalogue, which categorises galaxies into filaments, tendrils, and voids, we
correct emission lines for dust extinction and select star-forming galaxies
based on the BPT diagram. Metallicity and star formation rate are estimated and
used to fit the M-Z and M-SFR relations through both Bayesian and least-squares
approaches. We find that metallicity increases in denser environments, while
star formation rate decreases, with the most notable contrasts seen between
filament/tendril galaxies and those in voids. Galaxies in filaments and
tendrils that are not group members show little to no deviation from their
control samples. Morphological analysis reveals no significant differences.
Overall, galaxies in denser environments appear more chemically enriched with
lower SFRs, likely due to processed material and reduced cold gas availability,
while isolated void galaxies maintain higher SFRs and lower metallicities,
possibly due to ongoing cold gas accretion. These results suggest that local
environmental conditions, rather than large-scale structure alone, are the main
drivers of the observed trends.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06284v1" target="_blank"><h2>Before its time: a remarkably evolved protocluster core at z=7.88</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Callum Witten, Pascal A.

overabundance of galaxies fed by large gas reservoirs. Their early and
accelerated evolution results in a distinct difference in the properties of
galaxies resident in protoclusters versus the field, which is known to be in
place by $z\sim 5-6$. We utilise JWST NIRCam observations of the A2744-z7p9OD
protocluster at $z=7.88$ to constrain the properties of resident galaxies. We
identify seven new protocluster members, bringing the total number to 23 and
the total stellar mass of the protocluster to in excess of $10^{10}\
\rm{M_{\odot}}$. These galaxies are remarkably evolved just 650 Myr after the
Big Bang, preferentially showing redder UV-slopes and stronger Balmer breaks
than is typical of field galaxies. We use the PROSPECTOR spectral energy
distribution fitting code to derive key galaxy properties, finding distinct
populations in the core versus the outskirts of the protocluster. The core is
largely composed of dusty, massive galaxies which can be characterised as
undergoing a synchronised (mini)-quenched phase, while galaxies in the
protocluster outskirts are undergoing recent bursts of star formation. Finally,
a strong suppression of the continuum around the Ly$\alpha$-break evidences
extreme neutral hydrogen column densities in many resident galaxies ($N_{\rm

the Milky Way and other galaxies. We present new observational constraints
based on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia
DR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving
sampling of the metallicity, [Fe/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work
marks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region,
enabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar
parameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to
APOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred
Galactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the
stellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the
field stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure
supported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and
kinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same
region. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak
at around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha/Fe]
population with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid
early formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that
the bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild
triaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits,
likely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of
the spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor
([Fe/H] < -1.0) halo. We find the inner-thick disc to be kinematically hotter
(mean Vphi ~125 km/s) than the local-thick disc. ...</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06347v1" target="_blank"><h2>Parsec-scale SiO emission in the Galactic Center</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  N.

of the central region orbiting the central super-massive black hole Sgr A* have
revealed a stable grouping of clouds with a disk-like structure known as the
circumnuclear disk (CND) orbiting Sgr A* between 1.5 and 3 pc. The CND houses
the densest population of gas outside the ionized streams in the minispiral
falling onto Sgr A*. However, the small-scale kinematics of the clouds and gas
are poorly understood in this region. In this paper, we report single dish SiO
(1-0) observations of the central 5 pc surrounding Sgr A* taken with the Green

East-neither of which are associated with the CND. However, one region in the
