Weaver</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted for publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are typically identified through their
distinctive X-ray or radio emissions, mid-infrared (MIR) colors, or emission
lines. However, each method captures different subsets of AGN due to
signal-to-noise (SNR) limitations, redshift coverage, and extinction effects,
underscoring the necessity for a multi-wavelength approach for comprehensive
AGN samples. This study explores the effectiveness of spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting as a robust method for AGN identification.
  Using {\tt CIGALE} optical-MIR SED fits on DESI Early Data Release galaxies,
we compare SED-based AGN selection ({\tt AGNFRAC} $\geq0.1$) with traditional
methods including BPT diagrams, WISE colors, X-ray, and radio diagnostics.
  SED fitting identifies $\sim 70\%$ of narrow/broad-line AGN and 87\% of
WISE-selected AGN. Incorporating high SNR WISE photometry reduces star-forming
galaxy contamination from 62\% to 15\%. Initially, $\sim50\%$ of SED-AGN
candidates are undetected by standard methods, but additional diagnostics
classify $\sim85\%$ of these sources, revealing LINERs and retired galaxies
potentially representing evolved systems with weak AGN activity. Further
spectroscopic and multi-wavelength analysis will be essential to determine the
true AGN nature of these sources.
  SED fitting provides complementary AGN identification, unifying
multi-wavelength AGN selections. This approach enables more complete -- albeit
with some contamination -- AGN samples essential for upcoming large-scale
surveys where spectroscopic diagnostics may be limited.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08497v1" target="_blank"><h2>Catalog of very-high-energy emitting active galactic nuclei at high
  Galactic latitudes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A. Neronov, D. Semikoz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) producing Very-High-Energy (VHE)
gamma-rays (energies above 100~GeV) has been revealed using observations with
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). However, our knowledge of the
VHE emitting AGN population is limited in the absence of an unbiased sky
survey. We use long exposure of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to perform a
survey of VHE emitting AGN at Galactic latitudes |b|>10 degrees. We consider
clustering of gamma-ray events with energies E>100 GeV around positions of AGN
from the 4-th LAT source catalog to select sources detected in the VHE range.
The VHE AGN catalog produced in this way contains overall 175 sources detected
with high confidence and additional 100 sources detected at more than 3-sigma
level. It is 90% complete at the flux limit 1.3e-12 erg/cm2s. Less than half of
the source sample (71) are previously reported VHE emitters, other sources are
new detections in the VHE band. The majority of VHE AGN detectable at the
survey flux limit are BL Lac type objects. We find their luminosity function to
derive their spatial density (6.5+/-0.5)e-7/ Mpc3 and the characteristic
luminosity scale ~1e44 erg/s. Ten sources in the VHE AGN catalog are nearby
radio galaxies and seven are flat spectrum radio quasars, while 20 sources are
unclassified AGN. We also include in our catalog four unidentified sources that
may or may not be VHE AGN. 63 source in the catalog are "extreme" blazars, with
41 of them being new VHE band detections. In spite of the fact that the VHE
flux is heavily attenuated by the pair production in interactions with
Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), the catalog includes 7 sources at
redshift larger than 1. Some of these sources show peculiar hardening of the
VHE band spectra that point either to errors in redshift determination, or to
limitations of modeling of cosmological evolution of EBL.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09962v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Theoretical Three-Dimensional Diagram to Separate Star Formation,
  Active Galactic Nuclei, and Shocks in Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Peixin Zhu, Lisa J. Kewley, Ralph S. Sutherland, Kathryn Grasha</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 7 figures (2 interactive figures available in the online journal), accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The excitation sources in galaxies are frequently mixed due to AGN and
stellar feedback, including star formation, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
shock excitation. Disentangling the star formation, AGN, and shocks in galaxy
integral-field spectra (IFU) at optical wavelengths is crucial to expanding the
galaxy sample for AGN and stellar feedback studies, given the lack of
multiwavelength observations for most of the galaxies that are observed in
optical wavelengths. Previous methods to address this issue either have a
limited application range or are highly uncertain in separating AGN from shock
excitation (D'Agostino et al. 2019; Johnston et al. 2023). Here, we propose a
theoretical three-dimensional (3D) diagram. This theoretical 3D diagram
overcomes the limitations of previous methods and can simultaneously separate
star formation, AGNs, and shocks in active galaxies. Along with the separation,
the new theoretical 3D diagram also constrains the gas metallicity, ionization
parameter, and gas pressure within the galaxy. By applying the Very Large
Telescope (VLT)/MUSE IFU data and the Wide Field Spectrograph IFU data for
NGC5728 on the theoretical 3D diagram, we find a star-forming ring surrounding
the galaxy center with a projected radius of $\sim$1 kpc in the sky plane, an
AGN ionized-bicone extended up to $\sim$2 kpc from the nuclear center, and a
fast shock dominated disk region at the base of the AGN outflow, which is
likely associated with a nuclear accretion disk or a result of jet-ISM
interaction. The theoretical 3D diagram opens a new window to study the
interplay among star formation, AGN, and shocks in active galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08853v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MeerKAT Massive Distant Clusters Survey: Detection of Diffuse Radio

provides insights into cosmic structure formation, the growth of magnetic
fields, and turbulence. This paper reports a search for diffuse radio emission
in a pilot sample of six high-redshift ($1.01 < z < 1.31$) galaxy clusters from
the MeerKAT Massive Distant Cluster Survey (MMDCS). These six clusters are
selected as the most massive $(M_{\rm 500c} = 6.7\,- 8.5 \times
10^{14}~\rm{M_{\odot}})$ systems based on their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich mass from
the full MMDCS sample of 30 ACT DR5 clusters, and were observed first to
explore the high-mass, high-redshift regime. Diffuse radio emission is
confidently detected in four clusters and tentatively identified in two, with
$k$-corrected radio powers scaled to 1.4 GHz ranging from $(0.46 \pm 0.16)$ to
$(4.51 \pm 1.68) \times 10^{24}\, \mathrm{WHz^{-1}}$ and linear sizes between
0.47 and 1.08 Mpc. Combining $Chandra$ X-ray data with MeerKAT radio data, we
find that 80$\%$ of clusters with X-ray observations exhibit disturbed
morphologies indicative of mergers. These $z > 1$ galaxy clusters scatter
around the established radio power-mass scaling relation observed at lower
redshifts, supporting turbulent re-acceleration models in high-redshift
mergers. However, their radio spectra are predicted to steepen ($\alpha <
-1.5$) due to enhanced inverse Compton losses in the cosmic microwave
background, rendering them under-luminous at 1.4 GHz and placing them below the
correlation. Our results demonstrate that merger-driven turbulence can sustain
radio halos even at $z > 1$ while highlighting MeerKAT's unique ability to
probe non-thermal processes in the early universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08925v1" target="_blank"><h2>Splashback radius and the mass accretion rate of RASS MCMF galaxy

density around X-ray selected ROSAT All Sky Survey-Multi-Component Matched
Filter galaxy clusters using Year 3 data from the Dark Energy Survey. We
measure the projected cross-correlation signal of the RedMaGiC "high density"
galaxies around an approximately volume-limited sample of 255 galaxy clusters
at a median redshift of $z=0.4$ and an X-ray luminosity $L_X > 10^{44}
\,\text{ergs} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{h}^{-2}$. This cross-correlation signal
measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.41 allows us to infer a 3D number
density profile which shows a significant steepening at the edges of these
galaxy clusters, namely the splashback radius of $r_{sp}$ /$h^{-1}
\mathrm{M_{\odot}} = 2.19^{+0.50}_{-0.43}$. We present the dependence of the
splashback radius value over a range of absolute galaxy magnitude cuts to look
for any evidence of dynamical friction affecting these results. The weak
lensing signal around our galaxy clusters measured with a signal-to-noise ratio
of 32.19 allows us to infer a halo mass $\text{log} (M_{\rm 200m} / h^{-1}
\text{Mpc}) = 14.68_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. Comparison of the location of the
splashback radius with the spherical overdensity boundary $r_{\rm 200m}$ shows
consistency with the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ predictions. We present the first
inference of the average mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters using our
measurements of the splashback radius.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08995v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the physical properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at

present-day massive spheroidal galaxies (proto-spheroids) can be constrained by
the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-South field,
which benefits from extensive photometric and spectroscopic data, including
those from the Hubble, Spitzer and Herschel. We adopted a physical model for
the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies, which form the bulk of dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z>=1.5 and confirmed its consistency with
recent mid-infrared high-z galaxy luminosity functions. Using the model and the
JADES survey strategy, we simulated a sample of proto-spheroids over 87.5
arcmin^2, matching the JADES/GOODS-S survey area. Photometric redshifts
estimated from simulated JWST photometry showed >=95% accuracy and were used in
SED fitting with CIGALE. We demonstrated that JWST will provide reliable
stellar mass estimates up to 0.1 dex for the majority of proto-spheroids at
z>=1.5 and can detect low-mass systems during cosmic noon that were
inaccessible in the pre-JWST era. Focusing on the active star-forming phase of
the proto-spheroid evolution, we defined a sub-sample flux limited at 250
micron (DSFG sample) and derived SFR, dust luminosity and dust mass
complementing the JWST photometry with that from Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel. We
also constructed a JWST-selected DSFG catalog from ASTRODEEP data using NIRCam
colour criteria and demonstrated strong consistency between the observed and
simulated DSFG populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08469v1" target="_blank"><h2>The connection between galaxy mergers, star formation and AGN activity

using novel methods for both galaxy classification and property measurements.}
{Mergers in HSC-SSP observational images are identified through fine-tuning
Zoobot, a pretrained deep representation learning model, using images and

predicted within our current understanding of galaxy formation within a
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Observational tests, such as gravitational lensing, have
made potential detections of such objects around individual galaxies as well as
in galaxy groups and clusters. The question of whether or not a dim counterpart
might reside in these objects remains an open question. We investigate this
point using the TNG50-1 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. Under the
assumption of TNG50's galaxy formation model, we do not find haloes or
subhaloes above a total mass of $\rm 10^{9.7} \ M_{\odot}$ that are entirely
dark. However, under realistic effective surface brightness cuts of $\rm \leq
29 \ mag \ arcsec^{-2}$, the inference of the most massive dark subhalo in
galaxy groups and clusters becomes $\rm M_{DM} \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{10} \
M_{\odot}$. Concentrating on galaxy groups and clusters, we find that dark
subhaloes are ubiquitous with more massive dark subhaloes tending to
preferentially reside further from the centers of clusters. We find that
subhaloes in the mass range of $\rm 4.5 \times 10^{7} \leq M_{DM}/M_{\odot}
\leq 2.1\times 10^{8}$ tend to be the most likely to reside in the strong
lensing regions of galaxy groups and clusters, and argue that future dark
subhalo searches should investigate this mass range.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09123v1" target="_blank"><h2>The hot circumgalactic medium in stacked X-rays: observations vs

Submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Current cosmological simulations rely on active galactic nuclei (AGN)
feedback to quench star formation and match observed stellar mass
distributions, but models for AGN feedback are poorly constrained. The
circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a helpful laboratory to study this
process, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are
directly impacted by AGN. Recent observations from the eROSITA instrument
provide constraints on these distributions through measurements of extended
soft X-ray emission. Here, we generate synthetic eROSITA observations from the
EAGLE and SIMBA cosmological simulations, comparing them against observations
of galaxies stacked by stellar mass, halo mass, and star-formation rate. SIMBA
outperforms EAGLE in matching observed surface brightness profiles in general,
but neither simulation consistently agrees with observations across the full
range of galaxy properties we studied. We find that variations in CGM X-ray
emission between simulations are driven by density differences at $R \lesssim
0.2 R_{200c} $, and temperature and metallicity changes at larger radii. We
directly model predicted contributions from X-ray binaries (XRBs), finding that
the hot plasma contributes $\approx$ 20 times more to the CGM X-ray luminosity
than XRBs, except at $M_*<10^{11} M_\odot$, where the contamination from XRBs
becomes more significant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08439v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of Odd Radio Circles and Other Peculiars in the First Year of

distant galaxies. To identify these objects, we employ a hybrid methodology
combining supervised object detection techniques and visual inspection of radio

two additional candidate ORCs, expanding the known population of these objects.
In addition to ORCs, we also identify 55 Galaxies with Large-scale Ambient

These GLAREs may represent different evolutionary stages of ORCs, and studying
them could offer valuable insights into their evolutionary processes. We also

Comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive
black holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important
roles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies
over cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with
them remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the
properties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary
black hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational
wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to
reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We
point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$
is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on
the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel.
The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry,
islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model
predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a
function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number
density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same
redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an
AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of
the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and
NSCs out to high redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08545v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fading in the Flow: Suppression of cold gas growth in expanding galactic
  outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alankar Dutta, Prateek Sharma, Max Gronke</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 20 figures, 1 table; submitted to MNRAS; comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Multiwavelength observations reveal multiphase outflows that play a crucial
role in redistributing gas and metals in and around galaxies. Theoretical
modelling of such multiphase outflows often employs wind tunnel simulations of
a spherical cold ($\sim 10^4 \ \rm K$) cloud facing a uniform hot ($\sim 10^6\
\rm K$) wind. However, outflows are naturally expanding and wind conditions
change downstream -- a crucial aspect overlooked in most idealized simulations.
To address this, we examine how an expanding wind influences the survival,
morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We perform idealized hydrodynamic
simulations of radiative cloud-crushing in an expanding wind, where the steady
background wind is modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier & Clegg 1985 (CC85)
analytic solution. Moving downstream, we find that the clouds remain locally
isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast
with respect to the ambient medium, and they eventually dissipate into the
wind. This also suppresses the growth of cold gas mass in comparison to a
plane-parallel wind since entrained clouds move into a less radiative
background. Using analytic scaling arguments, we present a physical picture of
cloud evolution in a CC85 wind. Cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium
are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional homogeneous wind
tunnel simulations, our simulations account for the differential expansion
experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds moving in an outflow.
Consequently, a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold
gas tails develop -- features closer to observations. In addition, we
demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds may substantially alter the
radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09395v1" target="_blank"><h2>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM. I. Kinematic and

3783. For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed
characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic
nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along
with their ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_{\rm H}$. The
high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption
lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower
energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our
spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum
uncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow
absorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In
addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe
XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic
luminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve
spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically
broader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent
velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases
with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally
declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point,
suggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption
profile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV
absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer
that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a
'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving
mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind
models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08932v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measurement of the Dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$Galaxy Cross-Power

caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic
errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power
spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale
$k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent
with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with
group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback
processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the
physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as
FRB surveys expand.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09136v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mergers of galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sugata Kaviraj</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> This is a pre-print of a chapter for the Encyclopedia of Astrophysics (edited by I. Mandel, section editor S. McGee) to be published by Elsevier as a Reference Module</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The evolution of our Universe is strongly influenced by the attractive force
of gravity. A key aspect of this evolution, therefore, is the merging of
galaxies. Here, we explore the role of mergers in shaping the properties of
massive galaxies over cosmic time. Observational methods of finding mergers
include identifying galaxy pairs in close proximity, visual inspection of
galaxy images to identify signatures of mergers (e.g. tidal features) and using
morphological parameters such as Asymmetry and the Gini coefficient. The
fraction of merging galaxies increases with redshift, potentially out to z~6.
The principal impact of merging is to transform the morphological mix of
massive galaxies, from largely rotationally-supported systems at high redshift
to more dispersion-dominated systems in the nearby Universe. Mergers also drive
gas towards the central regions of the remnant, fuelling starbursts and feeding
supermassive black holes. However, only around a third of the stellar and black
hole mass at the present day is directly attributable to merging.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08368v1" target="_blank"><h2>Prospects for Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Science with eXTP</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shu-Xu Yi, Wen Zhao, Ren-Xin Xu, Xue-Feng Wu, Giulia Stratta, Simone Dall'Osso, Yan-Jun Xu, Andrea Santangelo, Silvia Zane, Shuang-Nan Zhang, Hua Feng, Huan Yang, Junjie Mao, Junqiang Ge, Lijing Shao, Mi-Xiang Lan, He Gao, Lin Lin, Ning Jiang, Qingwen Wu, Tong Liu, Yun-Wei Yu, Xiang-Yu Wang, Jin Zhang, Dafne Guetta, Jin-Jun Geng, Di Xiao, Yong-Feng Huang, Yacheng Kang, Tian-Yong Cao, Zhen Zhang, Zhenwei Lyu, Zhen Pan, Yunfeng Chen, Yong Gao, Ang Li, Yu-Cong Fu, Shuo Xiao, Wei-Yang Wang, Fayin Wang, Zhenyin Zhao, Weihua Lei, Rong-Feng Shen, Lixin Dai, Guang-Lei Wu, Liang-Duan Liu, Jin Zhang, Xilong Fan, Xing-Jiang Zhu, Youjun Lu, Fan Xu, Kangfa Cheng, Da-Bin Lin, Xiao-Hong Zhao, Jun-Jie We, Bin-Bin Zhang, Ji-Rong Mao, Yongquan Xue, Xinwen Shu, Wenjie Zhang, Wei-Li Lin, Achille Fiore, Zhuo Li, Antonio Martin-Carrillo, Joseph Fisher, Fei Xie, Ye Li, Sandro Mereghetti, Shao-Lin Xiong, Yu-Han Yang, Eleonora Troja, Zi-Gao Dai, Da-Ming We, En-Wei Liang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to the SCIENCE CHINA Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new
transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the
rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to
study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and
Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key
advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity & large effective
area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in
high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential
time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave
(GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts
(FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and
TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of
future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection
capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their
applications in gravity and cosmology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09125v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining resolved extragalactic $R_{21}$ variation with well

Rosolowsky, Frank Bigiel, Jiayi Sun, Hao He, Ashley T. Barnes, Yixian Cao, Fu-Heng Liang, Hsi-An Pan, Toshiki Saito, Sumit K. Sarbadhicary, Thomas G. Williams</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ); 30 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) are commonly used as bulk molecular gas tracers. The CO
line ratios (especially CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) - $R_{21}$) vary within and among
galaxies, yet previous studies on $R_{21}$ and alike often rely on measurements
constructed by combining data from facilities with substantial relative
calibration uncertainties that have the same order as physical line ratio
variations. Hence robustly determining systematic $R_{21}$ variations is
challenging. Here, we compare CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) mapping data from ALMA for 14
nearby galaxies, at a common physical resolution of 1.7 kpc. Our dataset
includes new ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) maps of 12 galaxies. We investigate $R_{21}$
variation to understand its dependence on global galaxy properties, kpc-scale
environmental factors, and its correlation with star formation rate (SFR)
surface density and metallicity. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is
0.05 dex. This is lower than previous studies which reported over 0.1 dex
variation, likely reflecting significant flux calibration uncertainties in
single-dish surveys. Within individual galaxies, $R_{21}$ has a typical mean
value of ~0.64 and 0.1 dex variation, with an increase to ~0.75 towards
galactic centers. We find strong correlations between $R_{21}$ and various
galactic parameters, particularly SFR surface density, which shows a power-law
slope of 0.10-0.11 depending on the adopted binning/fitting methods. Our
findings suggest that, for studies covering main sequence galaxy samples,
assuming a fixed $R_{21}$=0.64 does not significantly bias kpc-scale molecular
gas mass estimates from CO(2-1). Instead, systematic uncertainties from flux
calibration and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor account for more systematic
scatter of CO-derived molecular gas properties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09219v1" target="_blank"><h2>Diffuse Interstellar bands and ultraviolet extinction bump: a Milky Way
  perspective on distant galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R. Lallement</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 5 figures, to appear in Astronomy Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The spectral width wB and the center wavelength lB of the UV absorption bump
uvB measured for two z=7 galaxies were found to differ from Milky Way (MW)
values. A decrease of wB by 45% and a positive shift of lB by 70-80 Ang were
measured. In the MW, the uvB amplitude hB and wB do vary; however, such a
narrow bump has never been observed and no variability of lB has been
convincingly found. Recently, links have been found between both hB and wB and
the strength of several Diffuse Interstellar absorption Bands (DIBs). They were
found to be limited to the sigma-type DIBs and their detection to be strongly
favored if the data were limited to monocloud-type lines-of-sight, selected
based on 3D dust maps. We extended the study of the links between MW DIBs and
uvB to the lB value and to the hB to continuum ratio, and compared MW
variations of the bump parameters to high z values. We used the 5780 and 6284 A
sigma, and 5797 and 5850 A zeta DIBs. Similarly to hB and wB, lB reacts to the
abundance of sigma carriers and is insensitive to the abundance of zeta DIB
carriers, which dominate in dense cloud cores. A strong abundance of sigma
carriers induces a shift of lB to longer wavelengths and a decrease of wB. The
MW lB and wB variability range is about half the difference between average MW
values and values in the distant galaxies. These results reinforce the
hypothesis of the existence of individual types of hydrocarbon molecules
responsible for both DIBs and part of the UV bump. They show that the majority
of species responsible for narrow and positively shifted bumps in distant
galaxies have a link with or are those producing the sigma DIBs and the
long-wavelength part of the bump in the MW, and that species producing the
short-wavelength part of the bump in the MW are of a different nature and
absent along the paths to regions of those distant galaxies that contribute
most to the UV emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08527v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Compton-thick AGN Population and the $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution of

Accepted for publication in MNRAS on 5 June 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a census of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nucleus (AGN)
population and the column density ($N_{\rm{H}}$) distribution of AGN in our
cosmic backyard using a mid-infrared selected AGN sample within 15 Mpc. The
column densities are measured from broadband X-ray spectral analysis, mainly
using data from $\textit{Chandra}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. Our sample probes AGN
with intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $L_{\rm 2-10, int} = 10^{37}$-$10^{43}$
erg s$^{-1}$, reaching a parameter space inaccessible to more distant samples.
We directly measure a 32$^{+30}_{-18}\%$ CT AGN fraction and obtain an
$N_{\rm{H}}$ distribution that agrees with that inferred by the
$\textit{Swift}$-BAT survey. Restricting the sample to the largely unexplored
domain of low-luminosity AGN with $L_{\rm 2-10, int}$ $\leq$ $10^{42}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, we found a CT fraction of 19$^{+30}_{-14}\%$, consistent with those
observed at higher luminosities. Comparing the host-galaxy properties between
the two samples, we find consistent star formation rates, though the majority
of our galaxy have lower stellar masses (by $\approx 0.3$ dex). In contrast,
the two samples have very different black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$)
distributions, with our sample having $\approx$1.5 dex lower mean mass ($M_{\rm
BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$). Additionally, our sample contains a
significantly higher number of LINERs and H$_{\rm{II}}$-type nuclei. The
Eddington ratio range probed by our sample, however, is the same as
$\textit{Swift}$-BAT, although the latter dominates at higher accretion rates,
and our sample is more evenly distributed. The majority of our sample with
$\lambda_{\rm Edd} \ge$ 10$^{-3}$ tend to be CT, while those with $\lambda_{\rm
Edd} <$ 10$^{-3}$ are mostly unobscured or mildly obscured.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09140v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave

Comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces
and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave
(GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which
are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here
systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer
phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able
to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences
are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of
analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of
hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the
surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate
over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW
signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e> 0.05$). We
discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used
to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in
unprecedented detail.</p></br></body>
