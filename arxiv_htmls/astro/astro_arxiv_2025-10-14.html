evolution. Dust grains are the main sites for the formation of molecules needed
for star formation but are also important for the acceleration of outflows that
can remove the gas reservoir critical for stellar mass growth. Using the MIRI
medium-resolution integral field spectrograph aboard the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST), we detect the 3.28 $\mu$m aromatic and the 3.4 $\mu$m
aliphatic hydrocarbon dust features in absorption in a redshift 4.601 hot
dust-obscured galaxy, blue-shifted by $\Delta$V=$-5250^{+276}_{-339}$
kms$^{-1}$ from the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The extremely high
velocity of the dust indicates that the wind was accelerated by radiation
pressure from the central quasar. These results pave a novel way for probing
the physics of dusty outflows in active galaxies at early cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10772v1" target="_blank"><h2>Black Holes in the Shadow: The Missing High-Ionization Lines in the

substantial population of high-redshift, broad-line active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), whose properties challenge standard models of black hole growth and AGN
emission. We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST
Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 < z < 9, to
constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources
with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z > 5, we find
a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative
to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places
strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution
(SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By
comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black
holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua
struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths
across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for
modified SEDs -- either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion
or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by
intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy
photons before they reach the BLR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09059v1" target="_blank"><h2>HST Confirms Sub-5 kpc Dual Quasar Pairs at Cosmic Noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Qian Wang, Xuheng Ding, John Silverman, J.

growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic
nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH)
binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the
critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained elusive due to angular
resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two
sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z>1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which
fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using
high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy,
we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS
J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc
separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W)
and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and
spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\beta$+[OIII]
and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition
reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended,
disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger,
while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an
advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations
yield M$_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\odot$ with line-of-sight
velocity offsets of $(0.7\pm0.1)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and
$(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These confirmations
directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening
new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09820v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving stellar populations, star formation, and ISM conditions with

a large spiral, star-forming (SF) galaxy at z=2.2, with evidence for radial gas

conduct a comprehensive and resolved study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and
stellar properties, from rest optical to near-IR, via emission-line
diagnostics, resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of
high-resolution imaging, and Pa$\beta$ line detection in NIRCam WFSS data. Our
analysis reveals massive ($M_{\star}\simeq$(0.67-3.5)$\times$10$^{9}$
$M_{\odot}$) SF clumps with star formation rates (SFRs) ~3-24 $M_{\odot}$/yr,
and quite low dust attenuation ($A_V\simeq$0.4), electron density ($n_{e}$<300

to be modestly massive ($M_{\star}$=(7$\pm$3)$\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$),
heavily obscured ($A_V$=6.43$\pm$0.55), and likely to have formed most of its
stellar mass in the past (SFR=82$\pm$42 $M_{\odot}$/yr over the last 100 Myr),
yet still forming stars at a lower rate (SFR=12$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$/yr over the
last 10 Myr). We infer a metallicity 12+log(O/H)~8.54 and an apparent
enhancement of the N/O abundance (log(N/O)$\simeq -1.0$) in all distinct galaxy
regions, a likely consequence of dilution effects due to radial inflows of
metal-poor gas. We measure a sub-solar sulfur abundance (log(S/O)$\simeq$-1.9).
Finally, the radial stellar age profile reveals older stellar populations in
the inner galaxy regions compared to the outskirts, pointing to an inside-out
growth of K20-ID7.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09753v1" target="_blank"><h2>BEES: Quasar lifetime measurements from extended rest-optical emission

billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have only been active as
luminous quasars for less than a million years. Recently, extended Ly$\alpha$
nebulae around $z\sim6$ quasars have revealed that these short observed
lifetimes are unlikely a sightline-dependent effect. However, the
interpretation of Ly$\alpha$ emission is not straightforward due to its
resonant nature. In this work, we use rest-frame optical emission lines, which
more directly trace photoionization by the quasar, to unambiguously validate
the short line-of-sight quasar lifetimes observed at early cosmic epochs. We
use deep James Webb Space Telescope/NIRSpec IFU observations of five $z\sim 6$
quasars with small proximity zones to search for their extended emission line
nebulae in H$\alpha$ and [O III]$5007$, and detect extended emission in both
emission lines around four quasars in our sample. We then use the
light-crossing time of these nebulae to measure quasar lifetimes along
transverse sightlines. Using their H$\alpha$ nebulae, we also confirm that
recombination is likely the dominant emission mechanism behind their previously
detected Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. Our results confirm the existence of high-redshift
quasars with extremely short lifetimes, $t_{\rm Q} \lesssim 10^{5}\ {\rm yr}$,
hosting billion-solar-mass black holes, indicating that rapid accretion is
likely responsible for the assembly of SMBHs in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11326v1" target="_blank"><h2>MSA-3D: Uncovering Weak AGNs and Resolved Outflows in Disguise in

galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1.7 from the JWST/NIRSpec MSA-3D survey, which uses
slit-stepping to build IFU-like datacubes at 0.1'' resolution. We map
emission-line morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the warm ionized gas
using [N II]/H$\alpha$, [S II]/H$\alpha$, and [O III]/H$\beta$. Relative to
z$\sim$0 galaxies at fixed stellar mass, our sources show systematically lower
[N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ and elevated [O III]/H$\beta$, consistent
with harder radiation fields and lower metallicities. Radially, [O
III]/H$\beta$ profiles are typically flat or mildly positive, whereas [N
II]/H$\alpha$ also remains flat or declines outward, mirroring metallicity
trends. On kpc scales, we find a strong positive correlation between [N
II]/H$\alpha$ and velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), linking local excitation to
turbulent or shock-driven kinematics. Six galaxies ($\sim$ 16% of the sample)
host spatially localized regions with elevated [N II]/H$\alpha$, high
EW(H$\alpha$), and V_RMS = $\sqrt{V^2 + \sigma^2} > 200$ km/s, indicative of
weak AGN activity, shocks, or outflows. For these candidates we infer modest
warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 Msun/yr and kinetic powers $\sim$ 0.1-1% of
the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or H$\alpha$). These values
place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in
continuity with $\dot{M_{out}}-L_{AGN}$ scaling relations across 0 < z < 6. A
completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with $L_{AGN} \geq
10^{43}$ erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of
detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09830v1" target="_blank"><h2>GATOS IX: A Detailed Assessment and Treatment of Emission Line

to study extended dust structures in the circumnuclear regions of nearby AGN.
However, broadband imaging filters cannot distinguish dust continuum emission
from emission lines, and so accounting for the emission line contamination
becomes crucial in studying extended dust in these environments.This paper uses
Cycle 1 MIR imaging from JWST/MIRI and spectroscopy from JWST/MRS for 11 local
Seyfert galaxies, as part of the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey
(GATOS). Three of the objects (NGC 3081, NGC 5728, and NGC 7172) exist in both
datasets, allowing direct measurement of the line emission using the
spectroscopy for these objects. We find that extended MIR emission persists on
scales of 100s of parsecs after the removal of contamination from emission
lines. Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects
(from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be
generalised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and
band. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS
spectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data. We
find that these methods estimate the contamination within 10 percentage points.
This paper serves as a useful guide for methods to quantify and mitigate for
emission line contamination in MIRI broadband imaging</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09568v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Underdensities Host the Clearest IGM Ly$α$ Transmission and

fundamental questions. We present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy
(WFSS) observations toward two of the most Ly$\alpha$-transmissive QSO
sightlines near the end of reionization. We find that regions at $z \sim 5.7$
along both sightlines previously found to be low-density in Ly$\alpha$ emitters
are also underdense in [O III] emitters, with densities less than half the
cosmic mean. Other transmissive regions, however, are found to coincide with
average-density environments, indicating that multiple pathways may produce
high IGM transmission. For the first time, we measure the two-dimensional
cross-correlation between IGM transmission and galaxy positions, revealing
evidence for anisotropic ionization geometry. Specifically, we detect enhanced
transmission at transverse distances of $\Delta r \sim 0.8$ times the mean free
path, consistent with ionizing photons escaping preferentially along
large-scale structures that are aligned with, but offset from, the line of
sight. This anisotropic escape may contribute to the observed patchiness of
reionization and challenges the assumption of isotropic ionized bubble growth
in current models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11455v1" target="_blank"><h2>Feeding the dead: neutral gas inflow with suppressed star formation in a

($M_* \simeq 4\times 10^{10} M_\odot$) quiescent galaxy observed at
$z_{\rm{spec}} = 2.6576$ with JWST. From the redshifted absorption of the NaI
doublet at $\lambda \lambda 5890, 5896 $ Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity
$v=278^{+79}_{-79}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a column density $\log(N_{NaI}/\rm{cm^2}) =
13.02^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$. We derive the inflowing mass of the gas $M_{in} =
1.6^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^8 M_\odot$ and rate $\dot{M}_{in} = 19^{+6}_{-7} \,
M_\odot \, \rm{yr}^{-1}$. The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests
that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot
confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments
are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the
galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of
$0.2 \, M_\odot \, \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Moreover, its star formation history suggests
that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past $\sim1$ Gyr, with half
of its stars formed by redshift $z_{50}=11^{+18}_{-3}$. We discuss that the
inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star
formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct
evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching
while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST
and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11629v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Primordial Stars to Early Galaxies: A Semi-Analytic Model

of Population III stars and their metal-enriched descendants, incorporating
dark matter halo merger trees from cosmological $N$-body simulations and
feedback from reionization. Our extended model is calibrated using two
complementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves
individual Population III and II stars to $z\sim14.6$, and Renaissance, which
is lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z
\sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of
primordial star formation over a large range in halo mass. We find good
agreement between our calibrated model and Aeos, reproducing the evolution in
number of star-forming halos and total stellar mass. Achieving this agreement
requires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence
of, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold
$M_{\mathrm{crit}}$. Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death
and subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos
that have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay
in simulations limits physically motivated calibrations. Finally, we apply our
model to larger-volume dark matter only simulations and predict $\sim10$ active
Pop III sources at $z = 10$ lie within the area strongly lensed by galaxy
cluster MACS J0416 with a magnification exceeding $\mu > 30$. These results
demonstrate that semi-analytic approaches, when calibrated to hydrodynamical

active galactic nuclei (AGN) at cosmic noon. Studies comparing those type II
AGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an
evolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes,
disturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of
angular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking
AGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material
enshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback
clears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and
also quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of
intermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and
dusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their
star-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the
time of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of
SDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801. The lensing magnification
enables a detailed study of the host galaxy spanning the rest-ultraviolet
through near infrared. JWST and HST photometry, morphological models, and
models of the host's spectral energy distribution reveal that SDSSJ2222+2745 is
actively transitioning from a type II to type I AGN. Catching a lensed AGN at
this special evolutionary phase makes SDSSJ2222+2745 a unique laboratory to
study the physical processes involved in the transition and their relationships

and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize
both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The
best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by
reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona,
modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the
line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong,
relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is required in order to
obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence
of a $v_{\rm out} \sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find
tentative evidence for a $v_{\rm out} \sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and
indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a
non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification
schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by
the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux
variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation
of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of
high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset,
emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis

imagery to investigate the relationship between AGN and host-galaxy properties
in the JWST era, finding a correlation between the level of spatial disturbance
(as measured by shape asymmetry, $A_S$) and obscuration ($N_H$). Here in Paper
II, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of
Seyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the
single-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of
inactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most
complete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at $0.6<z<2.4$ in the
GOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a
significant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the
pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and
mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN
evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations
of AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering
sub-quasar AGN at these redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11351v1" target="_blank"><h2>REBELS-IFU: Linking damped Lyman-$α$ absorption to [CII] emission

formation, dust growth, and the escape of ionising photons, making it a key
ingredient in understanding both galaxy assembly and reionisation. Yet, direct
constraints on the HI content of galaxies at z>6 have been scarce. With JWST,
Ly$\alpha$ damping wings in galaxy spectra can now provide a direct probe of
this neutral component. We analyse JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra of 12 UV-luminous
galaxies from the REBELS-IFU program at z~6.5-7.7, deriving HI column densities
by modelling Ly$\alpha$ damping wings. Significant damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption
is detected in eight galaxies, with $N_{\mathrm{HI}}\gtrsim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.
We use the column densities and sizes derived for these sources to estimate
their HI mass and compare with $L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}$-$M_{\mathrm{HI}}$
calibrations. The resulting HI masses show a tentative correlation with those
inferred from [CII], although the [CII]-based estimates are systematically
larger, suggesting that the HI reservoirs may extend beyond the [CII]-emitting
gas. We also combine the DLA-based measurements with FIR-derived dust-to-gas
ratios, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicities. No correlation is found
between DLA-based and FIR-based dust-to-gas ratios, but combining the
REBELS-IFU sample with literature samples at lower metallicities reveals a
strong correlation between $A_{\mathrm{V}}/N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ and metallicity.
These findings suggest that by $z\sim7$ massive galaxies can already host
substantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with
$A_{\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\mathrm{HI}}$-metallicity trends at lower redshift. At the
highest redshifts ($z>8$), however, we see tentative evidence for
systematically lower $A_{\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ at fixed metallicity,
which may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust
destruction/expulsion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09754v1" target="_blank"><h2>MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) -- IV. Revealing hidden AGN in dwarf

galaxy formation and the growth of the massive black holes found in massive
galaxies. Their detection as AGN is challenging due to their low luminosity and
compact size. This can be circumvented employing multi-wavelength observational
strategies, such as combining optical and radio observations, which enables the
detection of AGN features that may be hidden in single-wavelength analyses We
aim to detect any jet-like emission indicative of the presence of an AGN in a
sample of four dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures based on spatially resolved
emission line diagnostic diagrams with SDSS MaNGA. Confirming the presence of
an AGN will prove IFU spectroscopy to be a resourceful tool for identifying
hidden or switched-off AGN. Using VLA radio observations, we image the radio
emission of the four dwarf galaxies and derive their integrated radio flux and
luminosity. We compare these to that expected from star formation processes to
determine the origin of the radio emission and probe if it is consistent with
the results of the emission line diagnostic diagrams. We find that one out of
the four galaxies shows AGN radio emission consistent with the analysis of the
MaNGA IFU data. The kinetic jet power of this source is Qjet ~ 1e42 erg / s,
indicating that dwarf galaxies can host radio jets as powerful as those of
massive radio galaxies. This galaxy exhibits an AGN outflow able to escape the
gravitational bound produced by the dark matter halo, along with a decrease in
the star formation rate of the central region. This suggests the presence of
negative feedback from the AGN, which could be suppressing star formation. The
other three galaxies exhibit regions of radio emission consistent with a
stellar origin and overlapping with the star-forming regions found in the IFU
spectroscopy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08997v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Metallicity Gradients in the Reionization Epoch from the FIRE-2

simulations to investigate the evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial
gradients in galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Our sample consists
of 22 galaxies spanning the redshift range $z \sim 10-5$. We find that galaxies
at $z\sim10$ exhibit a median metallicity gradient of $-0.15\,\mathrm{dex\cdot
kpc^{-1}}$ with substantial scatter, which gradually flatten to
$-0.1\,\mathrm{dex\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ at $z\sim6$, accompanied by a reduction in
scatter. In the EoR, metallicity gradients correlate positively with stellar
mass: more massive galaxies display flatter gradients with smaller scatter,
broadly consistent with recent JWST observations. At fixed stellar mass,
galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative
gradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope.
Because EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support,
we adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity
dispersion ($\Delta v/2\sigma$) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We
find a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and $\Delta
v/2\sigma$: galaxies with lower $\Delta v/2\sigma$ (i.e., weaker gas flows)
tend to exhibit steeper negative gradients. Furthermore, galaxies with steeper
gradients display higher central SFR surface densities, suggesting localized
star formation with inefficient interstellar medium mixing that drives
inside-out chemical enrichment in galaxy evolution in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11156v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measuring the Evolution of Bulge, Disk and Colour Gradients in HST

models to 2505 galaxies in GOODS-South across seven bands (bvizYJH) to IAB =
25.5, accounting for different component ellipticities and
inclination-dependent dust extinction. Extinction strongly affects structural
parameters and colour gradients in ~26% of the sample - primarily edge-on
galaxies with central obscuration (B-band face-on optical depth tau ~ 4) that
reveal clear bulge components in the near-infrared. Despite irregular
morphologies, the model captures observed colour gradients well. Bulges at z ~
1 differ markedly from z ~ 0, with typical Sersic index n ~ 1.0 and
bulge-to-disc size ratio Re/hd ~ 0.15, suggesting most galaxies host
pseudo-bulges formed via secular evolution. Galaxy ellipticity correlates
strongly with disk scale-length and absolute magnitude, partly driven by dust
extinction variations. We trace bulge and disk evolution from z ~ 0 to z ~ 2.5:
bulges are redder than disks (observed-frame) at z < 1.4, but colours converge
at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes. Redder galaxies show redder cores
relative to their outskirts, and brighter galaxies have redder cores.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09148v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detecting dark matter substructure with lensed quasars in optical bands</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jianxiang Liu, Kai Liao, Yan Gong</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Flux ratios of multiple images in strong gravitational lensing systems
provide a powerful probe of dark matter substructure. Optical flux ratios of
lensed quasars are typically affected by stellar microlensing, and thus studies
of dark matter substructure often rely on emission regions that are
sufficiently extended to avoid microlensing effects. To expand the accessible
wavelength range for studying dark matter substructure through flux ratios and
to reduce reliance on specific instruments, we confront the challenges posed by
microlensing and propose a method to detect dark matter substructure using
optical flux ratios of lensed quasars. We select 100 strong lensing systems
consisting of 90 doubles and 10 quads to represent the overall population and
adopt the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test as our statistical method. By
introducing different types of dark matter substructure into these strong
lensing systems, we demonstrate that using quads alone provides the strongest
constraints on dark matter and that several tens to a few hundred independent
flux ratio measurements from quads can be used to study the properties of dark
matter substructure and place constraints on dark matter parameters.
Furthermore, we suggest that the use of multi-band flux ratios can
substantially reduce the required number of quads. Such sample sizes will be
readily available from ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10735v1" target="_blank"><h2>Selecting Clusters and Protoclusters via Stellar Mass Density: I. Method

wide-area photometric surveys by first selecting their dominant galaxy-i.e.,
the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) or protoBCG-through the local stellar mass
density traced by massive galaxies. We focus on its application to the Hyper
Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) Wide Survey to detect candidates
up to $\rm z \sim 2$. In this work, we apply the method to mock galaxy catalogs
that replicate the observational constraints of the HSC-SSP Wide Survey. We
derive functions that describe the probability of a massive galaxy being the
dominant galaxy in a structure as a function of its stellar mass density
contrast within a given redshift interval. We show that galaxies with
probabilities greater than 50\% yield a sample of BCGs/protoBCGs with $\gtrsim
65\%$ purity, where most of the contamination arises from galaxies in massive
groups below our cluster threshold. Using the same threshold, the resulting
(proto)cluster sample achieves 80\% purity and 50\% completeness for halos with
$M_{\rm{halo}} \geq 10^{14} \ M_{\odot}$, reaching nearly 100\% completeness
for $M_{\rm{halo}} \geq 10^{14.5} \ M_{\odot}$. We also assign probabilistic
membership to surrounding galaxies based on stellar mass and distance to the
dominant galaxy, from which we define the cluster richness as the number of
galaxies more likely to be true members than contaminants. This allows us to
derive a halo mass-richness relation. In a companion paper, we apply the
algorithm to the HSC-SSP data and compare our catalog with others based on
different cluster-finding techniques and X-ray detections.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10736v1" target="_blank"><h2>Selecting Clusters and Protoclusters via Stellar Mass Density: II.

massive galaxies located in high-density regions of matter, identified as

based on proximity to the candidate central galaxy and the expected stellar

learning methods trained on a dataset combining spectroscopic redshifts from
the HSC-SSP Wide PDR3, high-accuracy photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020

conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star
formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH
emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and
ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local
radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z < 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs
remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed
formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS
observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We
confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and,
for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region
nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the
galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature
is clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically
brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral
molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR
line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a
combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing
4--8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can
produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations
of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the
physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst
regions, environments typical of the early universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11702v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction,

is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z >= 2. Only one such galaxy currently
exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst
Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec
integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of
the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM
kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We find that
the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of
turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The
cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or
dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that
photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape.
We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have
removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster,
making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11146v1" target="_blank"><h2>The evolution of CH in Planck Galactic Cold Clumps</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gan Luo, Arshia M.

A&A accepted</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> molecular gas (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Methylidyne (CH) has long been considered a reliable tracer of molecular gas
in the low-to-intermediate extinction range. Although extended CH 3.3 GHz
emission is commonly observed in diffuse and translucent clouds, observations
in cold, dense clumps are rare. In this work, we conducted high-sensitivity CH
observations toward 27 PGCCs with the Arecibo 305m telescope. Toward each
source, the CH data were analyzed in conjunction with $^{13}$CO (1--0), HINSA,
and H$_2$ column densities. Our results revealed ubiquitous subsonic velocity
dispersions of CH, in contrast to $^{13}$CO, which is predominantly supersonic.
The findings suggest that subsonic CH emissions may trace dense, low-turbulent
gas structures in PGCCs. To investigate environmental effects, particularly the
cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), we estimated CRIR upper limits from HINSA,
yielding values from $(8.1\pm4.7)\times10^{-18}$ to $(2.0\pm0.8)\times10^{-16}$
s$^{-1}$ ($N_{H_2}$ from $(1.7\pm0.2)\times10^{21}$ to
$(3.6\pm0.4)\times10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$). This result favors theoretical
predictions of a cosmic-ray attenuation model, in which the interstellar
spectra of low-energy CR protons and electrons match {\it Voyager}
measurements, although alternative models cannot yet be ruled out. The
abundance of CH decreases with increasing column density, while showing a
positive dependence on the CRIR, which requires atomic oxygen not heavily
depleted to dominate CH destruction in PGCCs. By fitting the abundance of CH
with an analytic formula, we place constraints on atomic O abundance
($2.4\pm0.4\times10^{-4}$ with respect to total H) and C$^+$ abundance
($7.4\pm0.7\times10^{13}\zeta_2/n_{\rm H_2}$). These findings indicate that CH
formation is closely linked to the C$^+$ abundance, regulated by cosmic-ray
ionization, while other processes, such as turbulent diffusive transport, might
also contribute a non-negligible effect.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11118v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intrinsic alignment of disks and ellipticals across hydrodynamical

H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines from the supercluster. This unique

for a sample of 94 emission-line galaxies across the supercluster. We find that
dust extinction, estimated from the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$

relatively quiescent systems exhibit comparatively low extinction. Among
galaxies with intermediate masses ($10^{8.5} < M_* < 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$), the
dust-corrected H$\alpha$-based star formation rates align with the main
sequence at this epoch. More massive galaxies, however, deviate from this
relation, exhibit redder colors, and reside predominantly in higher-density
environments. Although stellar mass, SFR, and galaxy color are clearly
influenced by environment, we detect no strong, systematic environmental

to tighten cosmological parameter constraints by accessing information beyond
two-point functions. However, its application in cosmological inference
requires a clear understanding of its sensitivity to astrophysical systematics,
the most significant of which are baryonic effects. These processes
substantially modify the matter distribution on small to intermediate scales
($k\gtrsim 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), leaving scale-dependent imprints on the
WL convergence field. We systematically examine the impact of baryonic feedback
on scattering coefficients using full-sky WL convergence maps with Stage IV
survey characteristics, generated from the FLAMINGO simulation suite. These
simulations include a broad range of feedback models, calibrated to match the
observed cluster gas fraction and galaxy stellar mass function, including
systematically shifted variations, and incorporating either thermal or jet-mode
AGN feedback. We characterise baryonic effects using a baryonic transfer
function defined as the ratio of hydrodynamical to dark-matter-only scattering
coefficients. While the coefficients themselves are sensitive to both cosmology
and feedback, the transfer function remains largely insensitive to cosmology
and shows a strong response to feedback, with suppression reaching up to $10\%$
on scales of $k\gtrsim 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that
shape noise significantly diminishes the sensitivity of the scattering
coefficients to baryonic effects, reducing the suppression from $\sim 2 - 10
\;\%$ to $\sim 1\;\%$, even with 1.5 arcmin Gaussian smoothing. This highlights
the need for noise mitigation strategies and high-resolution data in future WL

find that it is significantly shorter than extrapolations from lower $z$. This
has a substantial impact on the topology of reionization and thus the prospects
of tomography of the 21-cm signal from upcoming radio interferometers. In this
work we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly
incorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore
its effect on the process. Our model is based on the excursion set formalism
with an ionization condition which accounts for absorptions parameterized
through the MFP. With the goal of observational comparison, we include
additional modifications which make our model particularly suitable for
predicting one-point statistics of the ionization field (and 21-cm signal),
which are among the fundamental quantities for tomography. We find that the
effect of the MFP is much more significant during the later stages of
reionization, and that including a shorter MFP reduces the size of HII regions
by around an order of magnitude towards the end of reionization compared with
analytic models which do not account for the MFP. We find that the reported MFP
value produces a contrast in the 21-cm signal of $\mathcal{O}$(1 mK) or less at
resolutions $\theta \sim $ 15--35 arcmin, an order of magnitude below naive
estimates and up to a factor of several smaller than when using a larger MFP
value extrapolated from low $z$, requiring significantly more sensitivity for
imaging. We compare the contrast to noise estimates for arrays similar in size
to HERA and SKA-Low and find that SKA has sufficient sensitivity for direct
imaging (at the largest scales considered), while the predicted signal will be
challenging for arrays similar in size to HERA. Our model indicates that more
detailed sensitivity estimates are warranted in the context of a short MFP.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10845v1" target="_blank"><h2>HI terminal velocity curves -- Lessons learned from N-body/hydrodynamic

(MW) - a model that resembles the MW in several key aspects after many Gyrs of
evolution - would be extremely beneficial for Galactic Archaeology. Here we
present four new `surrogate' models, all built with the Nexus framework. The
simulations contain stars, dark matter and gas. Our most sophisticated model
allows gas to evolve thermodynamically, and includes star formation, metal
production, and stellar feedback. The other three models in this work have an
isothermal gas disc. We examine these new simulations in the context of cold
gas observations of the Galaxy. Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal
velocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function
of Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy.
It is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it
does not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which
is difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered
rotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our
models are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated
with our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in
the inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the
Galactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike
what is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW. We suggest possible
ways forward for future models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11132v1" target="_blank"><h2>Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES): Selection of targets for

Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) includes two flux-limited subsurveys with very
high (95\%) completeness requirements: Wide over $\sim\!1200$ deg$^2$ and Deep
over $\sim\!65$ deg$^2$. Both are $Z$-band selected, respectively as $Z<21.1$
and $Z<21.25$ mag, and additionally redshift-limited, while the true redshifts
are not known a priori but will be only measured by 4MOST. Here, we present a
classification-based method to select the targets for WAVES-Wide. Rather than
estimating individual redshifts for the input photometric objects, we assign
probabilities of them being below $z=0.2$, the redshift limit of the subsurvey.
This is done with the supervised machine learning approach of eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGB), trained on a comprehensive spectroscopic sample overlapping
with WAVES fields. Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes
from $u$ to $K_s$ and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the
classification are the $g$-band and the $u-g$, $g-r$ and $J-K_s$ colors. We
check the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide
limits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude
thresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of
94-95\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close
to the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic
training sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply
the classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million
photometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands
measured. Our work demonstrates that a machine-learning classifier could be
used to select a flux- and redshift-limited sample from deep photometric data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11427v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lyα Intensity Mapping in HETDEX: Galaxy-Lyα Intensity

power spectrum from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX).
We measure the cross-power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ intensity and
Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) in a redshift range of $1.9 < z < 3.5$. We
calculate the intensity from HETDEX spectra that do not contain any detected
LAEs above a signal-to-noise ratio of $5.5$. To produce a power spectrum model
and its covariance matrix, we simulate the data using lognormal mocks for the
LAE catalog and Ly$\alpha$ intensity in redshift space. The simulations include
the HETDEX sensitivity, selection function, and mask. The measurements yield
the product of the LAE bias, the intensity bias, the mean intensity of
undetected sources, and the ratio of the actual and fiducial redshift-space
distortion parameters, $b_\mathrm{g} b_I \langle I \rangle \bar{F}_{\rm RSD} /

demonstrate the statistical power of HETDEX for Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping

for constraining models of Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies used in modern

between cosmic expansion and gravitational dynamics. On large scales, galaxy
velocities follow Hubble's law, but within groups and clusters local
gravitational effects introduce significant departures from linearity. Using
the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we investigate whether dark energy
leaves detectable imprints on the local velocity-radius relation. We model the
kinematics with extensions of the Lemaitre-Tolman framework and apply Bayesian
inference to recover halo masses and the Hubble constant H0. The fits reveal
systematic biases: halo masses are underestimated with a median ratio
$M_{fit}/M_{true} = 0.95 \pm 0.28$, while the inferred Hubble constant clusters
around $H_0 = 64 \pm 16 km/s/Mpc$, compared to the simulation input of 67.74.
This corresponds to an average 25\% uncertainty in H0 recovery from the local
flow method. While the mass and expansion rate can be constrained, different
model variants whether including angular momentum, friction, or altered radial
scaling-remain statistically indistinguishable. Our results highlight both the
promise and the limitations of using local kinematics as a precision probe of
dark energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09569v1" target="_blank"><h2>SN 2021lwz: Another Exotic Luminous and Fast Evolving Optical Type Ic

Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of
transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims.
We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous
supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the
lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in
a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \simeq -14.5$ AB.
Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and
imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the
data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons
with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN
2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The
bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5
x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy
modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a
SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling
shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive
source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve
evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the
explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.24 ~M_\odot$) took place in a
low mass ($M \sim 10^{6.66}~M_\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation
rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions.
Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its
light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe
Types. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu
and SN 2018gep.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11626v1" target="_blank"><h2>JADES Dark Horse: demonstrating high-multiplex observations with

Submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel
observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately
permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme
multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single
configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint
(F444W<30 mag) z$_{\rm phot}$>3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising
emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6
and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850
sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over
2.5<z<8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than
standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (<200 sources), with no loss in
redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at
fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but
the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty.
The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5
(i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at $\lambda$~4 $\mu$m, demonstrating that
controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for
large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target
allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs,
gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line
calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line
AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables
robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain
large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground
between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth
of NIRSpec/MSA.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09480v1" target="_blank"><h2>What is the contribution of gravitational infall on the mass assembly of

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> molecular gas (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Star formation in galaxies is a complex phenomenon occurring on a very wide
range of scales, and molecular clouds are at the heart of this process. The
formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within
them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular,
the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and
prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we
conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant
molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the
interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving
down to scales $\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By
introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas
during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how
much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the
gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is
gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the
warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular
clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\gtrsim 400$
cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas
on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions
assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven
supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small
contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10548v1" target="_blank"><h2>Coherence of Supermassive Black Hole Binary Demographics with the nHz

the catalog with three main components: a model for the formation and
disruption of globular clusters based on cosmological simulations,
time-dependent potentials constructed with basis function expansions for
integrating stream orbits, and an improved particle spray algorithm for
efficient generation of stellar streams. We find that the observable widths and
lengths of mock streams as a function of galactocentric radius are well
described by power-laws for streams beyond 10 kpc. We generate mock photometry

the number of observable stars in GC stellar streams by several orders of

from CALET, DAMPE, HESS, positron flux from AMS-02, and gamma-ray flux from

$b\bar{b}$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$ and derive the
corresponding lower bound on the DM lifetime, $\tau_{\rm DM}$. We find that the
latest data from CALET gives a stringent constraint on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$

$\langle\sigma v\rangle_{{\rm

cosmology to date. So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by
using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type
Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts
(FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology
proposed by Macquart {\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\rm
DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution
functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant
$H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current
${\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\rm IGM}$ fairly close
to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for
the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a
small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a
loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125
localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly
preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian
evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension
between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of
modifying $\sigma_\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$, here
we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\rm
DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\ell$ and $e^\mu$,
respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018
and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria
AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\rm DM_{host}$ are
overwhelmingly strong.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10282v1" target="_blank"><h2>Microlensing of non-singular black holes at finite size: a ray tracing

accuracy of the theoretical description of these measurements needs to increase
correspondingly in order to infer the underlying cosmology that governs the
Universe. To this end, we have created the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables
in Euclid (CLOE), which is a novel cosmological parameter inference pipeline
developed within the Euclid Consortium to translate measurements and
covariances into cosmological parameter constraints. In this first in a series
of six papers, we describe the theoretical recipe of this code for the Euclid
primary probes. These probes are composed of the photometric 3x2pt observables
of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, along with
spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We provide this description in both Fourier
and configuration space for standard and extended summary statistics, including
the wide range of systematic uncertainties that affect them. This includes
systematic uncertainties such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic
feedback, photometric and spectroscopic redshift uncertainties, shear
calibration uncertainties, sample impurities, photometric and spectroscopic
galaxy biases, as well as magnification bias. The theoretical descriptions are
further able to accommodate both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods and
extended cosmologies with non-zero curvature, massive neutrinos, evolving dark
energy, and simple forms of modified gravity. These theoretical descriptions
that underpin CLOE will form a crucial component in revealing the true nature
of the Universe with next-generation cosmological surveys such as Euclid.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10749v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. III.

crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying
stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature
often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve
towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using
observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 $\mu$m range. We determined
extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the
reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties
are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve
derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the
literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M:
$A_\mathrm{F115W} : A_\mathrm{F162M} : A_\mathrm{F182M} : A_\mathrm{F212N} :
A_\mathrm{F360M} : A_\mathrm{F405N} : A_\mathrm{F470N} : A_\mathrm{F480M} =
1.84 \pm 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 \pm 0.005 : 0.607 \pm 0.014 : 0.306 \pm 0.011 :
0.248 \pm 0.017 : 0.240 \pm 0.019 : 0.21 \pm 0.03$. Besides, we found different
values of the extinction index for the short- ($\lambda \sim 1-2.5\,\mu$m,
$\alpha \sim 2$) and long-wavelength ($\lambda \sim 2.5-5\,\mu$m, $\alpha \sim
1.4$) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths.
Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic
centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary
in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations
between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the
uncertainties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11248v1" target="_blank"><h2>PDRs4All XVII: Formation and excitation of HD in photodissociation

rovibrational emission lines of HD in the Orion Bar, a prototypical
photodissociation region. This provides an incentive to examine the physics of
HD in dense and strong PDRs. Using the latest data available on HD excitation
by collisional, radiative and chemical processes, our goal is to unveil HD
formation and excitation processes in PDRs by comparing our state-of-the-art
PDR model with observations made in the Orion Bar and discuss if and how HD can
be used as a complementary tracer of physical parameters in the emitting
region. We compute detailed PDR models, using an upgraded version of the Meudon
PDR code, which are compared to NIRSpec data using excitation diagrams and
synthetic emission spectra. The models predict that HD is mainly produced in
the gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and
that the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2
transition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the
observations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2
dissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2
peaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We
derive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K. Due to high
continuum in the Orion Bar, fringes lead to high noise levels beyond 15 $\mu$m,
no pure rotational lines of HD are detected. The comparison to PDR models shows
that a range of thermal pressure P = (3-9)x10$^7$ K cm$^{-3}$ with no strong
constraints on the intensity of the UV field are compatible with HD
observations. This range of pressure is compatible with previous estimates from
H2 observations with JWST. This is the first time that observations of HD
emission lines in the near-infrared are used to put constraints on the thermal
pressure in the PDR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10021v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid preparation. Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid

require modelling numerous systematic effects during the inference process.
This implies varying a large number of nuisance parameters, which have to be
marginalised over before reporting the constraints on the cosmological
parameters. This is a delicate process, especially with such a large parameter
space, which could result in biased cosmological results. In this work, we
study the impact of different choices for modelling systematic effects and
prior distribution of nuisance parameters for the final Euclid Data Release,
focusing on the 3$\times$2pt analysis for photometric probes and the galaxy
power spectrum multipoles for the spectroscopic probes. We explore the effect
of intrinsic alignments, linear galaxy bias, magnification bias, multiplicative
cosmic shear bias and shifts in the redshift distribution for the photometric
probes, as well as the purity of the spectroscopic sample. We find that
intrinsic alignment modelling has the most severe impact with a bias up to
$6\,\sigma$ on the Hubble constant $H_0$ if neglected, followed by
mis-modelling of the redshift evolution of galaxy bias, yielding up to
$1.5\,\sigma$ on the parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{{\rm m}} /0.3}$.
Choosing a too optimistic prior for multiplicative bias can also result in
biases of the order of $0.7\,\sigma$ on $S_8$. We also find that the precision
on the estimate of the purity of the spectroscopic sample will be an important
driver for the constraining power of the galaxy clustering full-shape analysis.
These results will help prioritise efforts to improve the modelling and
calibration of systematic effects in Euclid.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11373v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST COSMOS-3D: Spectroscopic Census and Luminosity Function of [O III]

6.75<z<9.05 and the resulting [OIII] 5008 \AA Luminosity Function (LF) in the
COSMOS field. We leverage the 0.3 deg$^{2}$ covered to date by COSMOS-3D using
NIRCam/WFSS F444W (90% of the survey) to perform the largest spectroscopic
search for [OIII] emitters at 6.75<z<9.05. We present our catalogue of 237
[OIII] emitters and their associated completeness function. The inferred
constraints on the [OIII] LF enable us to characterise the knee of the [OIII]
LF, resulting in improved [OIII] LF constraints at z~7,8. Notably, we find
evidence for an accelerated decline of the [OIII] luminosity density between
z~7 and z~8, which could be expected if the metallicity of [OIII] emitters, as
well as the cosmic star-formation rate density, is declining at these
redshifts. We find that theoretical models that reproduce the z~7,8 [OIII] LF
do not reproduce well the [OIII] equivalent width distribution, pointing to
potential challenges in the modelling of[OIII] and other nebular lines in the
early Universe. Finally, we provide the first constraints on the cosmic
variance of [OIII] emitters, estimating at 15% the relative uncertainty for the
z~7,8 [OIII] LF in the 0.3 deg$^2$ field. This estimate is in good agreement
with that inferred from clustering, and shows that the [OIII] LF derived from
smaller extragalactic legacy fields is strongly affected by cosmic variance.
Our results highlight the fundamental role that wide-area JWST slitless surveys
play to map the galaxy large-scale structure down into the reionisation era,
serving as a springboard for a variety of science cases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10222v1" target="_blank"><h2>Starburst galaxies in the Hydra I cluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Clara C. de la Casa, Kelley M.

the HI properties for 89 cluster members detected with MeerKAT. A color

H${\alpha}$ and WISE infrared data to compare the star formation history at two
distinct timescales. Differences in the star forming activity depicted by both

galaxies have neutral gas measurements, and show disturbed HI disks that
suggest an environmentally-triggered boost in star formation within the last
10$^7$ yrs. Processes such as ram pressure stripping or tidal interactions may
underlie their enhanced star-forming activity and asymmetric disks. Since
Hydra's dynamical history is unclear, we examine the spatial and velocity
distribution of the sample. We reveal a possible link between the large scale
structure feeding the Hydra I cluster and the heightened star-forming activity
of the starburst galaxies. This feeding pattern matches the few substructure
that has been identified in Hydra in previous works, and may explain its

a population of new infalling galaxies that manifest the impact of their first

evenly distributed across the galactic disk, necessitating an explanation for
cluster dissolution. We analytically study tidal forces from cold molecular
clouds as a key mechanism for accelerated cluster disruption. Cloud tides,
caused by the gravitational pull of the parent cloud along the radial
direction, arise from the spatial gradient of gravitational acceleration and
drive cluster disruption. This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and
remains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the
cluster moves away. Cloud tides act on gas-deprived clusters, causing
exponential expansion on a tidal timescale of $t_{\rm tidal,ext} =
\sqrt{3/(8\pi G\rho_{\rm mean})}$, where $\rho_{\rm mean}$ is the cloud's
density at the cluster's location. With a duration of a few Myr, cloud tides
can lead to a 10 times increase of the cluster size, producing bar-like
elongated stellar aggregations resembling Gaia strings. These results establish
cloud tides as a potentially important mechanism for star cluster disruption.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10427v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark gaps and resonances in barred galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Taehyun Kim, Dimitri A.

expected to form as a consequence of secular evolution in barred galaxies.
Although several studies have proposed links between dark gap locations and
dynamical resonances, the results remain inconclusive. Using DESI Legacy
Imaging Survey data, we find that approximately 61% of barred galaxies exhibit
pronounced dark gaps. We compare the location of dark gaps with resonance radii
derived from the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to MaNGA data for the same
galaxies. Our analysis shows that dark gaps do not preferentially form at
specific resonances. Instead, their locations correlate with $\mathcal{R}$
$\equiv$ $R_{CR}/R_{Bar}$: slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while
fast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar
length and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by
their ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific
resonances. Notably, dark gaps located between the inner and outer rings are
closely associated with the corotation radius. In galaxies with two dark gaps
along the bar minor axis profile, the inner dark gap typically aligns with the
ultraharmonic resonance, and the outer dark gap corresponds to the corotation
radius. These findings suggest that some morphological types share similar

gaps may serve as proxies for dynamical resonances only in certain systems. Our
findings may help explain the discrepancies observed in earlier studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09153v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid preparation. Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid

over a billion galaxies to provide unprecedented constraints on the nature of
dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this goal requires a continuous
reassessment of the mission's scientific performance, particularly in terms of
its ability to constrain cosmological parameters, as our understanding of how
to model large-scale structure observables improves. In this study, we present
the first scientific forecasts using CLOE (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables
in Euclid), a dedicated Euclid cosmological pipeline developed to support this
endeavour. Using advanced Bayesian inference techniques applied to synthetic
Euclid-like data, we sample the posterior distribution of cosmological and
nuisance parameters across a variety of cosmological models and Euclid primary
probes: cosmic shear, angular photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy
lensing, and spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We validate the capability of
CLOE to produce reliable cosmological forecasts, showcasing Euclid's potential
to achieve a figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$
exceeding 400 when combining all primary probes. Furthermore, we illustrate the
behaviour of the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of
interest given different priors and scale cuts. Finally, we emphasise the
importance of addressing computational challenges, proposing further
exploration of innovative data science techniques to efficiently navigate the
Euclid high-dimensional parameter space in upcoming cosmological data releases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09760v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Spectroscopy of SN Ia 2022aaiq and 2024gy: Evidence for Enhanced

the normal Type~Ia supernovae (SN Ia) 2022aaiq and 2024gy in the nebular phase,
continuously spanning 0.35--28 microns. Medium-resolution JWST spectroscopy
reveals novel narrow ($v_{\mathrm{FWHM}}<1500$ km s$^{-1}$) [Ni II] 1.94 and
6.64 micron cores in both events. The MIR [Ni II] 6.64 micron line exhibits a
distinct narrow core atop a broader base, indicating a central enhancement of
stable Ni. This structure points to high central densities consistent with a
near-Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{Ch}$) progenitor or a high-metallicity
sub-$M_{Ch}$ progenitor. From detailed line-profile inversions of SN 2024gy, we
derive emissivity profiles for stable iron-group elements (IGEs), radioactive
material, and intermediate-mass elements (IMEs), revealing spatially distinct
ejecta zones. The [Ni III] 7.35 micron line shows a shallow-to-steep slope
transition - a "broken-slope" morphology - that matches predictions for delayed
detonation explosions with separated deflagration and detonation ashes. We also
reanalyze and compare to archival JWST spectra of SN 2021aefx and the
subluminous SN 2022xkq. We estimate a stable $^{58}$Ni mass of $\sim0.1$
M$_\odot$ for SN 2024gy, consistent with delayed detonation models, and
$\sim0.01$ M$_\odot$ for SN 2022xkq, favoring sub-$M_{Ch}$ scenarios. These
results demonstrate that resolved line profiles, now accessible with JWST,
provide powerful diagnostics of explosion geometry, central density, and
progenitor mass in SN Ia.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11555v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing cosmic curvature with Alcock-Paczynski data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yungui Gong, Qing Gao, Xuchen Lu, Zhu Yi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Alcock-Paczynski (AP) parameter $F_{AP}$ is independent of the sound
horizon $r_d$, making the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) AP measurements particularly well suited for
cosmological applications. We propose a novel null test of cosmic curvature
tailored to DESI BAO data that combines $F_{AP}$ with the ratios $D_V'/D_V$ or
$D_M'/D_M$. This null test can also be performed using a joint dataset of DESI
BAO and type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations. Additionally, we use the test
to assess the internal consistency and mutual compatibility of these datasets.
We find that the data are compatible. Although the results show that a
spatially flat universe is inconsistent with the data at low redshift
$z\lesssim 0.5$, we cannot draw the conclusion that the observational data
prefers $\Omega_k\neq 0$ because there is no observational data in that region.</p></br></body>
