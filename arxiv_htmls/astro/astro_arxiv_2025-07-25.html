Evidence of Late Population III Star
  Formation at Cosmic Noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sijia Cai, Mingyu Li, Zheng Cai, Yunjing Wu, Fujiang Yu, Mark Dickinson, Fengwu Sun, Xiaohui Fan, Ben Wang, Fergus Cullen, Fuyan Bian, Xiaojing Lin, Jiaqi Zou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables. Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), dust (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of
Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We
report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3;
hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$.
From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong
Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame
equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and
EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in
star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C
IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, are currently detected at statistically
significant level, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) <
6.52 ($Z < 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux
ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy
distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young
($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar
population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in
a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides
evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the
epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star
formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18614v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy quenching across the Cosmic Web: disentangling mass and
  environment with SDSS DR18</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anindita Nandi, Biswajit Pandey</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 1 table, 10 figures, comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title, abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy
quenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS
DR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters
based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density
field. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in
clusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the
increasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of
the quenched fraction beyond $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 10.6$ across all
environments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven
quenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this
threshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and
morphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)
\gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in
clusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway
where massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies,
potentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also
increases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters,
indicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The
high-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific
star formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the
stellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain
bluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their
cluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver
of galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17809v1" target="_blank"><h2>JADES: Carbon-enhanced, Nitrogen-normal compact galaxy at z=11.2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

Witstok</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting
and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early
Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium.
In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a
galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV
and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09,
CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29,
[NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640.
The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with
potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a
galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and
log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only
models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$
solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$>$10, and it is
consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source
being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no
increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some
other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of
second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity
and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN
activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the
second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the
galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18355v1" target="_blank"><h2>Molecular gas in a system of two interacting galaxies overlapping on the
  line-of-sight</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anaëlle Halle, Barbara Mazzilli Ciraulo, Daniel Maschmann, Anne-Laure Melchior, Françoise Combes</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> molecular gas (title, abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxy interactions can disturb gas in galactic discs, compress it, excite
it, and enhance star formation. An intriguing system likely consisting of two
interacting galaxies overlapping on the line-of-sight was previously studied
through ionised gas observations from the integral-field spectrograph Mapping
Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA). A decomposition into two components using MaNGA
spectra, together with a multi-wavelength study, allowed to characterise the
system as a minor-merger with interaction-induced star-formation, and maybe AGN
activity. We use new interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) gas of this
system from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to confront and
combine the spatially-resolved ionised and molecular gas observations. Mock
NOEMA and MaNGA data are computed from simulated systems of two discs and
compared to the observations. The NOEMA observations of the molecular gas,
dynamically colder than the ionised gas, help to precise the configuration of
the system, which we revisit as being a major merger. Combination of ionised
and molecular gas data allow us to study the star-formation efficiency of the
system.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17866v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the incidence of weak and strong Mg II absorbers towards the Flat and
  Steep Spectrum Radio quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ritish Kumar, Sapna Mishra, Hum Chand</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS Main Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The incidence rate of Mg II absorbers per unit redshift path (dN/dz) towards
quasar sightlines has been used to probe the interaction between quasar jets
and surrounding gas clouds. Studies using core- and lobe-dominated samples
found a higher dN/dz for strong Mg II absorbers (rest equivalent width,
W_r(2796) >= 1.0 A) in velocity offsets ranging from 5000 km/s < beta * c <
60000 km/s (with beta = v/c), toward core-dominated sources. In this study, we
applied a stringent spectral index criterion: alpha_radio < -0.7 for
steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) and alpha_radio > -0.3 for flat-spectrum
radio quasars (FSRQs). Using this, we assembled the largest sample to date: 441
FSRQs and 464 SSRQs with suitable optical spectra to study both strong
absorbers and weak (0.3 A < W_r(2796) < 1.0 A) Mg II absorbers. We conducted a
detailed comparison of absorbers' incidence rate and offset velocity
distributions. Our main findings are: (i) For both weak and strong absorbers,
we found no significant excess in dN/dz towards FSRQ compared to SSRQ
sightlines. (ii) The dN/dbeta distribution of Mg II absorbers along FSRQs and
SSRQs are statistically similar. (iii) The cumulative distribution of weak Mg
II absorbers is slightly lower for beta < 0.3, but shows an excess at higher
beta. This suggests that, while intrinsic Mg II absorber abundance is
comparable along both sightlines, FSRQs' more aligned relativistic jets cluster
weak absorbers at high beta, consistent with the scenario of jet-driven
acceleration of smaller gas clumps.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18292v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Tremaine-Weinberg method at high redshift</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mahmood Roshan, Asiyeh Habibi, J.

measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring
pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of
interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has
been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining
bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby
galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of
the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges.
However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains
unexplored in both observations and simulations. In this study, we generate
mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation.
These simulated observations are tailored to mimic the Integral Field Unit
(IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of $z\simeq 1.2$.
By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results
with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs
adequately for barred galaxies with bars sufficiently long to be detected by
JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method
to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18002v1" target="_blank"><h2>CU-JADE: A Method for Traversing Extinction Jumps along the
  Line-of-Sight</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shiyu Zhang, Yang Su, Xuepeng Chen, Min Fang, Fujun Du, Shaobo Zhang, Qing-Zeng Yan, Xin Liu, Miaomiao Zhang, Yan Sun, Ji Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables; accepted for publication in AJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), dust (abstract), molecular gas (abstract), interstellar dust (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance
estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates
distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying
distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction
patterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance
measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In
this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance
Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these
observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity
to detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2)
minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and
(3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve
the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for
extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO
survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision
parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas
distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate
distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of
gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a
full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights
into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen.
These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and
physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17817v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the ionizing photon output of galaxies near cosmic dawn with the
  patchy kSZ effect</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Garett Lopez, Anson D'Aloisio, Christopher Cain</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 35 pages, 14 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), galaxy formation (abstract), quasar (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A key result from JWST's first cycles is that galaxy formation was well
underway by $z=10$. The implications of these early galaxies for reionization
are less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization
state of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe
of the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the
level of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper,
we use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy
kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\alpha$
forest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization
and the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the
amplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of
reionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the
high-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this
correlation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and
the effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of
breaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in
the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ
power spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered
sources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\ell = 3,000$, so
measurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the
history-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ
measurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of
the ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.</p></br></body>
