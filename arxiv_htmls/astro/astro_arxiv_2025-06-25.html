drawn from the JWST/NIRSpec AURORA program. For the first time, we directly
compare outflow properties from the early universe to the present day using
near-UV absorption lines. We measure ISM kinematics from Fe II and Mg II
absorption features in 41 and 43 galaxies, respectively, and examine how these
kinematics correlate with galaxy properties. We find that galaxies with
outflows tend to have higher stellar masses, and that maximum outflow
velocities increase with stellar mass, SFR, $\beta$, $E(B-V)$, and $A_V$. We
also find that Mg II emission is more common in galaxies with lower masses,
higher sSFRs, and less dust. These trends are consistent with those in
star-forming galaxies at $z<2$ when using the same outflow tracers, suggesting
that the feedback from star formation has played a persistent role in shaping
galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We also directly compare near-UV and far-UV
features in the same NIRSpec spectrum for a $z=5.19$ galaxy, finding consistent
ISM kinematics and demonstrating that different tracers yield comparable
measurements. We also detect Na D absorption in 10 galaxies, which have higher
stellar mass, SFR, and dust attenuation compared to galaxies without Na D
absorption, which is consistent with $z\sim0$ studies. The broad continuum
coverage and sensitivity of NIRSpec will enable future studies with larger
samples, allowing for robust tests of these trends across a wider dynamic range
of galaxy properties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstructing Quasar Spectra and Measuring the Ly$α$ Forest with

through absorption features. In particular, absorption caused by neutral
hydrogen gas, the ``Ly$\alpha$ forest,'' is a key spectroscopic tracer for
cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond
the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring LyA
absorption cannot directly derive the intrinsic quasar continuum and make
strong assumptions on its shape, thus distorting the measured LyA clustering.
We present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for directly reconstructing the
intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the LyA forest from observations.
SpenderQ uses the Spender spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and
redshift-invariant latent encoding of quasar spectra, combined with an
iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions. To demonstrate its
performance, we apply SpenderQ to 400,000 synthetic quasar spectra created to
validate the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 LyA cosmological
analyses. SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra,
including the broad LyB, LyA, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines. Redward of
LyA, SpenderQ provides percent-level reconstructions of the true quasar
spectra. Blueward of LyA, SpenderQ reconstructs the true spectra to < 5\%.
SpenderQ reproduces the shapes of individual quasar spectra more robustly than
the current state-of-the-art. We, thus, expect it will significantly reduce
biases in LyA clustering measurements and enable studies of quasars and their
physical properties. SpenderQ also provides informative latent variable
encodings that can be used to, e.g., classify quasars with Broad Absorption
Lines. Overall, SpenderQ provides a new data-driven approach for unbiased LyA
forest measurements in cosmological, quasar, and IGM studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18400v1" target="_blank"><h2>No apparent forbidden/permitted narrow emission lines in the broad line

regions (BLRs) and narrow emission line regions (NLRs) are fundamental
spectroscopic characteristics of broad line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs).
Lack of central BLRs leads to the identified true Type-2 AGNs without central
hidden BLRs, providing clues on formation/suppression of AGN BLRs. Whether were
there BLAGNs with lack of central NLRs is still an open question. Here, in the
blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613, both blue continuum emissions and broad emission
lines can be clearly detected in its SDSS spectrum, however there are no
apparently detected narrow emission lines in the optical/NUV bands, leading to
no central normal NLRs in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613. In order to explain
the lack of NLRs, evolving NLRs is proposed that the radial outflows are
carrying materials from BLRs to NLRs and the current narrow line emission
materials are lying closer to the outer side of central BLRs in SDSS
J1521+0613. The results in this manuscript can indicate a new unique subclass
of BLAGNs, the BLAGNs without central normal NLRs, which will provide potential
clues on physical origin/evolution of AGN NLRs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17584v1" target="_blank"><h2>Outflowing shocked gas dominates the NIR H$_2$ emission from the dual

and ionised gas phases in the central 2 kpc of NGC6240, based on JWST/NIRSpec
and ALMA observations. We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to
de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to
the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the
Pa$\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view
arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The
NIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission
between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\mu$m feature does not
follow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace
PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched
from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This
wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does
not show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or
expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright
non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN,
which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus,
coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold
(sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this
region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$),
suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to
the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our
results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled
from the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded
in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17440v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray emission signatures of galactic feedback in the hot circumgalactic

circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies. Next-generation X-ray
observatories will enable detailed studies of the hot CGM in emission. To
support these future efforts, we make predictions of the X-ray emission from
the hot CGM using a sample of 28 $\sim$Milky Way-mass disk galaxies at $z=0$
from seven cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites incorporating a wide
range of galactic feedback prescriptions. The X-ray surface brightness (XSB)
morphology of the hot CGM varies significantly across simulations. XSB-enhanced
outflows and bubble-like structures are predicted in many galaxies simulated
with AGN feedback and in some stellar-feedback-only galaxies, while other
galaxies exhibit more isotropic XSB distributions at varying brightnesses.
Galaxies simulated without cosmic ray physics exhibit radial XSB profiles with
similar shapes ($\propto r^{-3}$ within $20-200$ kpc), with scatter about this
slope likely due to underlying feedback physics. The hot CGM kinematics also
differ substantially: velocity maps reveal signatures of bulk CGM rotation and
high-velocity biconical outflows, particularly in simulations incorporating AGN
feedback. Some stellar-feedback-only models also generate similar AGN-like
outflows, which we postulate is due to centrally-concentrated star formation.
Simulations featuring AGN feedback frequently produce extended temperature
enhancements in large-scale galactic outflows, while simulations incorporating
cosmic ray physics predict the coolest CGM due to pressure support being
provided by cosmic rays rather than hot CGM. Individually-resolved X-ray
emission lines further distinguish hot CGM phases, with lower-energy lines
(e.g., O VII) largely tracing volume-filling gas, and higher-energy lines
(e.g., Fe XVII) highlighting high-velocity feedback-driven outflows.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17422v1" target="_blank"><h2>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of

reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts
$0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the
previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line
region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$
line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that
the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat
cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent
within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon
acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of
two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope
is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM
model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as
the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we
find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its
intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for
low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger
homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington
ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17396v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JWST/AURORA Survey: Multiple Balmer and Paschen Emission Lines for

redshift z=1.5-4.4 star-forming galaxies using multiple Balmer and Paschen
lines from the JWST/AURORA survey. Nebular reddening derived from Paschen lines
exceeds that from Balmer lines for at least half the galaxies in the sample
when assuming the commonly-adopted Galactic extinction curve, implying the
presence of optically-thick star formation. The nebular attenuation curves
exhibit a broad range of normalizations (Rv ~ 3.2-16.4). Motivated by the
offsets in reddening deduced from the Balmer and Paschen lines, and the high Rv
values for the individual nebular attenuation curves, both of which suggest
variations in the dust-stars geometry, we propose a model with a subunity dust
covering fraction (fcov). Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line
ratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation
curves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and
thin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be
accommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way
sightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust. Integrated
measurements of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines can be used to place novel
constraints on the dust covering fraction towards OB associations. These, in
turn, provide new avenues for exploring the role of dust and gas covering
fraction in a number of relevant aspects of high-redshift galaxies, including
the impact of stellar feedback on ISM porosity and the escape of Ly-alpha and
Lyman continuum radiation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17379v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping the gas density with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and patchy

wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information. Pairing measurements of
the CMB temperature map obtained by DR5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) with the large-scale structure imaging survey conducted by the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, DECaLS DR9, we investigate two effects that
are sensitive to the gas density $\tau$: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) and
`patchy screening' (also known as `anisotropic screening'). In particular, we
measure the stacked profiles around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at a mean
redshift of $z \approx 0.7$. We detect the kSZ signal at 7.2$\sigma$, and we
find a signal at $\sim 4.1\sigma$ for the patchy screening estimator, which is
in excess relative to the kSZ signal. We attribute this excess to contamination
from CMB lensing. We demonstrate the effect of lensing using $N$-body
simulations, and we show that the screening signal is dominated by it.
Accounting for lensing, our measurement places a 95\% upper bound on the
optical depth of the Extended DESI LRG sample of $\tau <$ 2.5 $10^{-4}$ for a
mean value of the sample of $\tau \approx$ 1.6 $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, via
hydro simulations, we show that the underlying optical depth signal measured by
both effects (after removing the CMB lensing contribution) is in perfect
agreement when adopting either a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter
or a high-pass filter. Consistent with previous measurements, we see evidence
for excess baryonic feedback around DESI LRGs in the patchy screening
measurement. Provided both effects are measured with high signal-to-noise, one
can measure the amplitude ratio between them, which is proportional to the
root-mean-square velocity of the host halo sample, and place constraints on
velocity-sensitive models such as modified gravity and phantom dark energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19721v1" target="_blank"><h2>MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming

star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (7<log(Mstar/Msun)<11),
using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST

morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation
curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo
decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM
components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on
mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the
best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the
Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio
et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as
or better than the other profiles in >65% of the sample. We find that the
kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We
find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions >50%. For 70% of SFGs, we infer a
DM inner slope, gamma < 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation
is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and
concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with
larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM
density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar,
while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of
the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z
systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale
radii are z-invariant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18983v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of magnetic fields in ram pressure stripping of satellite

important consequences for satellite galaxies moving through the magnetised
circumgalactic medium (CGM) of their host. We therefore study the effect of
magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of satellites in the CGM of massive
galaxies. We use cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of three massive galaxy
haloes ($M_{\rm{200c}} = 10^{12.5-13}$M$_\odot$), each simulated with and
without magnetic fields. The fraction of gas retained after infall through the
CGM across our full satellite sample shows no population-wide impact of
magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping. However, for the most massive
satellites, we find that twice as much gas is stripped without magnetic fields.
The evolution of a galaxy's stripped tail is also strongly affected. Magnetic
fields reduce turbulent mixing, significantly inhibiting the dispersion of
metals into the host CGM. This suppressed mixing greatly reduces condensation
from the host CGM onto the stripped tail. By studying the magnetic field
structure, we find evidence of magnetic draping and attribute differences in
the stripping rate to the draping layer. Differences in condensation from the
host CGM are attributed to magnetic field lines aligned with the tail
suppressing turbulent mixing. We simulate one halo with enhanced resolution in
the CGM and show these results are converged with resolution, though the
structure of the cool gas in the tail is not. Our results show that magnetic
fields can play an important role in ram pressure stripping in galaxy haloes
and should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17641v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Bondi Accretion Aided by Baryons and the Origin of JWST Little Red

a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early
Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of
its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black
hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST
little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes
with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the
formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the
initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass
on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an
intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas.
Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through
dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority
of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than
baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17663v1" target="_blank"><h2>Diffuse X-Ray-emitting Gas in the Central Region of Star-Forming

million degrees, provides a pivotal perspective for understanding the physical
and chemical properties of star formation, galactic evolution, and their
associated feedback mechanisms. We use archival data from $Chandra$
observations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming
galaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central
region of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy
presents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and
then varies slowly outside this range. Compared to the global relation between
the diffuse thermal X-ray luminosity from hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm
gas}$) and the star formation rate (SFR), we found a super-linear relation of
${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm
log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+40.15$ for the center of these
sample galaxies. This result suggests that more intense stellar feedback is
associated with stronger star formation activity in the central region of
star-forming galaxies, where more energy output from supernovae (SNe) and
stellar winds is converted into X-ray flux. Furthermore, the slope of the
$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$SFR relation anticorrelates with spatial
scale in the galactic central region. This indicates that the characteristics
of central hot gas emission are gradually averaged over larger areas. The
diffuse X-ray luminosity also shows a good correlation with molecular gas,
stellar mass, and mid-plane pressure traced by the baryonic mass, although
these relations show relatively large scatter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18490v1" target="_blank"><h2>Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jonathan C.

Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical

(HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC$_3$N)
detected in the JWST/MIRI MRS spectrum (4.9-27.9 $\mu$m) of the local ultra
luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS~07251$-$0248. We find that the molecular
absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic
velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation
models, we derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) from 42 to 185 K for
these absorption bands. This range of measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be explained
by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a byproduct of the strength, effective
critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results
suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell
($\dot{M}$$\sim$90-330 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), which might be the base of the
larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the
elevated abundance of molecular cations (H$_3^+$, HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and
N$_2$H$^+$) can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with
log($\zeta_{\text{H}_2}$/n$_{\rm H}\, [\text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}])$ in the
range of -19.1 to -18.2, consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as

effect (SZE), both produced by the intra-cluster medium (ICM), are key probes
in cosmological and astrophysical studies. To maximise the scientific return of
such surveys, complementary data are required for cluster confirmation and
redshift estimation. This is typically provided by wide-field optical and
infrared surveys, which are increasingly challenged by ongoing and future
ICM-selected samples. In particular, at high redshifts ($z>1$) probed by
upcoming SZE-selected samples, current large surveys may be insufficient for
reliable confirmation. Deep, high-resolution infrared surveys like Euclid will
thus be essential for confirming most high-redshift clusters. We present an
analysis of the first sizeable Euclid dataset (Q1), overlapping with several
ICM-selected cluster samples. We apply an adaptation of the MCMF cluster
confirmation tool to estimate key properties, including redshift and richness,
and to predict Euclid's capabilities for high-redshift cluster confirmation. We
find promising performance, particularly at high redshifts, while richness
estimates at low redshifts ($z<0.4$) are currently limited by Q1 data quality
but should improve with future releases. Using MCMF runs on random lines of
sight, we predict that Euclid will confirm clusters at $1<z<2$ as effectively
as current optical surveys at $z<0.6$, significantly enhancing high-redshift
confirmation. SZE-selected samples will thus greatly benefit from Euclid
overlap. Among five known high-$z$ SZE clusters in Q1, we identify the

of the system of equations for the BECDM gravitationally coupled to Euler
equations for a compressible ideal gas (IG) that we use as a model of baryonic
matter. Numerical simulations are constructed for various scenarios that start
with a vortex solution for the BECDM and a randomly distributed ideal gas, with
the aim of investigating whether the matter distribution and dynamics of the
vortex influences the dynamics and distribution of the gas. We find that the
gas condensation process is most efficient when the IG mass dominates over the
BECDM, and when the IG has low initial velocity dispersion. We also find that
strong bosonic self-interaction does not guarantee the vortex stability,
instead, it can trigger dynamical instabilities that disrupt both the vortex
structure and the surrounding gas. An interesting finding is that the vortex
drives a persistent morphological signature on the gas, often in the form of
ring-like features visible in projected density maps. These patterns survive
nonlinear evolution and may serve as indirect tracers of vortex structures in
BECDM halos, potentially offering a novel and testable observational probe of
the model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19589v1" target="_blank"><h2>Black Holes in the Red-sequence Elliptical Galaxies at Redshifts $\sim

modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be
the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling
mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the
black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq
2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we
show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy
has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it
turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized
by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence
elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the
redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological

several decades, and studies of their dust and gas distributions reveal
complicated morphological structures. Their dynamics involve turbulence even in
the absence of internal energy sources such as stars. We study in detail two
such clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and
topology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of
superthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of
filament superposition combined with turbulent motions. We use a variety of
spectroscopic and imaging archival observations of the gas and dust components.
The spectroscopic data set comprises HI 21 cm, 12CO, 13CO, and CH line
profiles. We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution
and temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare
molecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm
line. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used
to characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity
diagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The
unusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to
superposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1
km/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures
with similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths
of about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc. In general, the molecular gas is
embedded within more extended neutral hydrogen structures. Velocity gradients
found within these structures are not necessarily dynamical, convergent flows.
Projection effects and topology of the driving flows produce signatures that
mimic velocity shears even if they are simply distortions of ordered gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17387v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing Density and Gravitational Potential Fluctuations of the

Submitted to ApJ, comments are welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Substructure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for establishing the
correlation between star formation and feedback and has the capacity to
significantly perturb stellar orbits, thus playing a central role in galaxy
dynamics and evolution. Contemporary surveys of gas and dust emission in nearby
galaxies resolve structure down to $\sim 10\,$pc scales, demanding theoretical
models of ISM substructure with matching fidelity. In this work, we address
this need by quantitatively characterizing the gas density in state-of-the-art
MHD simulations of disk galaxies that resolve pc to kpc scales. The TIGRESS-NCR
framework we employ includes sheared galactic rotation, self-consistent star
formation and feedback, and nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling. We fit simple
analytic models to the one-point spatial, two-point spatial, and two-point
spatio-temporal statistics of the surface density fluctuation field. We find
that for both solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, (i) the surface
density fluctuations follow a log-normal distribution, (ii) the linear and
logarithmic fluctuation power spectra are well-approximated as power laws with
indices of $\approx -2.2$ and $\approx -2.8$ respectively, and (iii) lifetimes
of structures at different scales are set by a combination of feedback and
effective pressure terms. Additionally, we find that the vertical structure of
the gas is well-modeled by a mixture of exponential and sech$^2$ profiles,
allowing us to link the surface density statistics to those of the volume
density and gravitational potential. We provide convenient parameterizations
for incorporating realistic ISM effects into stellar-dynamical studies and for
comparison with multi-wavelength observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18413v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of environment on the evolution of disc galaxies density

and stellar surface density in their bright inner regions. Nonetheless, their
faint outer regions often display a break, with either a down-bending or an
up-bending profile. Recent Euclid Early Release Observations show that
down-bending breaks are scarce in the Perseus cluster, as already suspected in
Virgo. We use hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxies interacting with a
Perseus-like cluster. We show that Type II profiles (down-bending) can be
rapidly eroded by the cluster tidal field on a 1 Gyr timescale, while Type III
(up-bending) and Type I (no break) profiles remain largely unaffected. Type II
profiles are eroded through dynamical processes, including tidal stirring of
stars by the cluster potential and triggering of star formation in the outer
disc. Our simulations show that observations of disc breaks across environments
and cosmic epochs are consistent with a coherent evolutionary picture. At high
redshift, JWST reveals early break structures in isolated environments. At low
redshift, field disc galaxies retain these breaks, while dense clusters, as
observed by Euclid in Perseus, show significant alterations. Our findings
support a scenario in which down-bending profiles result from internal
processes during early formation phases and are later modified by environmental
effects in clusters. This interpretation does not require additional mechanisms
such as ram-pressure stripping or star formation threshold variations to
explain the observed evolution of down-bending breaks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17689v1" target="_blank"><h2>A three-dimensional, multi-wavelength view and time-dependent analysis

local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations.
We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the
local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization
simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict
collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first
all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$,
[NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions
only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry
out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent
metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing
features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very
local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370
$\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the
observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a
factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate
required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas,
possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding
the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their
ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely
ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the
leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of
ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19162v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Star Formation Histories of Changing-Look AGN Host Galaxies

transition between Seyfert Type 1 and 2 over periods of months to years.
Several mechanisms to trigger these transitions have been proposed, but we have
yet to conclusively determine their cause. Recent studies suggest CL-AGN are
hosted primarily in galaxies which are shutting down star formation (Dodd et
al. 2021; Liu et al. 2021, Wang et al. 2023), which may indicate a link between
galaxy quenching and changing look events. We use Prospector stellar population
synthesis software (Leja et al. 2017; Johnson & Leja 2017; Johnson et al. 2021)
to model non-parametric star formation histories for 39 CL-AGN host galaxies.
We find that $43^{+13}_{-12}\%$ of our gold sample CL-AGN at z < 0.15 are star
forming, while $29^{+13}_{-10}\%$ fall in the Green Valley of the stellar
mass-sSFR diagram. At z > 0.15, $57^{+13}_{-18}\%$ of CL-AGN in the gold sample
are star-forming and $29^{+19}_{-14}\%$ are in the Green Valley. CL-AGN hosts
have similar star formation properties to the host galaxies of Seyfert 1 and 2
AGN at z < 0.15 and to Seyfert 2 AGN at z > 0.15. We find no statistically
significant differences in the star formation properties of turn-on and
turn-off CL-AGN. We also find no evidence for rapid quenching in the Green
Valley CL-AGN. We conclude that CL-AGN state transitions are not associated
with the formation history of CL-AGN host galaxies on large spatial scales,
implying CL-AGN state transitions may instead result from nuclear-scale or
accretion disk effects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17554v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamics of Multiphase Carbon in the Turbulent Circumgalactic Medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yue Hu, Evan Scannapieco, Edward Buie II, Siyao Xu, Samuel T Sebastian, Om Biswal</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> CGM (abstract), circumgalactic medium (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a crucial role in regulating material

to develop a consistent physical model that fully explains these results. Here
we investigate the impact of turbulence and non-equilibrium chemistry on the
properties of the CGM, using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that
include the impact of an ionizing background. Increasing turbulence enhances
small-scale density fluctuations, shifting the kinetic energy spectra from
Kolmogorov to Burgers scaling. This is indicative of shock-dominated
dissipation, which plays a critical role in driving carbon ionization and
shaping the multiphase structure of the medium. At the same time, the presence
of background radiation significantly alters the ionization balance, increasing
the prevalence of C\textsc{ii} and C\textsc{iv}. Thus, turbulence and the
background radiation have complementary roles: turbulence governs the spatial
distribution and facilitates the formation of ionized species, whereas the
background radiation modifies the overall ionization equilibrium, setting the

offers the most promising way to explain the origin of quasars at $z>7$.
Assuming atomic primordial gas, can Ly$\alpha$ photons escape from the central
regions of the collapse and serve as a diagnostic for the detection of these
pre-SMBH objects? Models assuming spherical collapse have found these photons
to be trapped and destroyed. We use Ly$\alpha$ radiation transfer within the
inflow-outflow geometry, based on earlier zoom-in cosmological modeling
involving radiation transfer and magnetic forces. Adopting geometry that
includes ongoing disky and spherical accretion, and formation of bi-conical
outflow funnel, we obtain formation of a dense radiatively-driven expanding
shell. The Ly$\alpha$ transfer is performed through a Monte Carlo algorithm,
accounting for destruction of Ly$\alpha$ photons and emergence of two-photon
emission. We find that substantial fraction of Ly$\alpha$ photons can escape
through the funnel, and calculate the line profiles, the line peak velocity
shift, asymmetry and cuspiness, by varying basic model parameters. The escaping
Ly$\alpha$ emission is anisotropic, and sensitive to overall inflow-outflow
geometry. The escaping fraction of Ly$\alpha$ radiation exceeds 95% from a
$z=10$ pre-SMBH object -- in principle detectable by the JWST NIRSpec in the
MOS mode, during $\sim 10^4$seconds for a $10\sigma$ signal-to-noise ratio.
Moreover, comparisons with line shapes from high-$z$ galaxies and quasars allow
to separate them from pre-SMBH objects based on the line asymmetry -- the
pre-SMBH line show a profound asymmetry and extended red tail.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18974v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: An emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  P.

Understanding the impact of baryonic processes such as star formation and AGN
feedback on matter clustering is crucial to ensure precise and unbiased
cosmological inference. Most theoretical models of baryonic effects to date
focus on two-point statistics, neglecting higher-order contributions. This work
develops a fast and accurate emulator for baryonic effects on the matter
bispectrum, a key non-Gaussian statistic in the nonlinear regime. We employ
high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a
combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and
baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical
parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects
on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications
across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the
emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \Euclid mock data,
employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical
simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to
better than 2$\%$ for the $68\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations
for $k \in [0.01, 20]\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ and ensures consistency between

components, such as bulges and disks, is essential for understanding galaxy
formation and evolution, particularly at high redshift, where galaxies are
compact and faint. Leveraging the unparalleled resolution and sensitivity of
JWST and imaging data from CEERs program, we simulate galaxies with bulge+disk
components and assess the effectiveness of single and double S\'ersic model
fittings, respectively. We first evaluate the performance of single S\'ersic
fits, and find it can recover total magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and size
(i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 27 mag. The features that emerged in the
residual map can properly reflect the underlying two-component structures. We
also show that S\'ersic indices can serve as proxies for the bulge-to-total
flux ratio (B/T). For double S\'ersic models, we find comparable accuracy in
recovering bulge and disk magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and effective
radius (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 26 mag. To quantitatively determine
whether a double S\'ersic model better describes our two-component systems
compared to a single S\'ersic profile, we evaluate the Bayesian Information
Criterion for both model configurations. To extend the applicability of our
results to other NIRCam programs, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of the simulated galaxies and find that model parameters are reliably
reproduced when the SNR exceeds 10. Our work demonstrates the detailed
morphological measurement uncertainties using single and double S\'ersic
models, which provides an essential reference for future JWST/NIRCam-based
morphological studies, especially for high-redshift galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17526v1" target="_blank"><h2>Association between optically identified galaxy clusters and the

they can include multiple halos projected along lines of sight. We study the
halos contributing to clusters using the Cardinal simulation, which mimics the
Dark Energy Survey data. We use the red-sequence-based cluster finding
algorithm redMaPPer as a case study. For each cluster, we identify the halos
hosting its member galaxies, and we define the main halo as the one
contributing the most to the cluster's richness ($\lambda$, the estimated
number of member galaxies). At $z=0.3$, for clusters with $\lambda > 60$, the
main halo typically contributes to $92\%$ of the richness, and this fraction
drops to $67\%$ for $\lambda \approx 20$. Defining "clean" clusters as those
with $\geq50\%$ of the richness contributed by the main halo, we find that
$100\%$ of the $\lambda > 60$ clusters are clean, while $73\%$ of the $\lambda
\approx 20$ clusters are clean. Three halos can usually account for more than
$80\%$ of the richness of a cluster. The main halos associated with redMaPPer
clusters have a completeness ranging from $98\%$ at virial mass
$10^{14.6}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ to $64\%$ at $10^{14}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. In
addition, we compare the inferred cluster centers with true halo centers,
finding that $30\%$ of the clusters are miscentered with a mean offset $40\%$
of the cluster radii, in agreement with recent X-ray studies. These systematics
worsen as redshift increases, but we expect that upcoming surveys extending to
longer wavelengths will improve the cluster finding at high redshifts. Our
results affirm the robustness of the redMaPPer algorithm and provide a
framework for benchmarking other cluster-finding strategies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17476v1" target="_blank"><h2>Signatures of BH seeding on the $\mathrm{M_{\displaystyle

supermassive ($10^6$-$10^8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) black holes (BHs) in the early
universe ($z \sim 4$-$7$). Current measurements suggest that many of these BHs
exhibit higher BH-to-stellar mass ratios than local populations, opening a new
window into the earliest stages of BH-galaxy coevolution and offering the
potential to place tight constraints on BH seeding and growth in the early
universe. In this work, we use the BRAHMA simulations to investigate the impact
of BH seeding on the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation. These simulations
adopt heavy $\sim10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ seeds and systematically varied BH
seeding models, resulting in distinct predictions for seed abundances. We find
that different seed models lead to different normalizations of the
$\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation at higher redshifts ($z > 2$) across all
$\sigma$, and at low redshift for systems with low $\sigma$ ($50~\mathrm{km\
s^{-1}} \lesssim \sigma \lesssim 80~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$). The most lenient
seed model also shows negligible evolution in the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$
relation across redshift, while more restrictive models have substantially
lower normalization on the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation for high
$\sigma$ ($\sim 100~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$) at high redshifts, and evolve upward
toward the local relation. We demonstrate that the
$\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ evolution is a direct consequence of
merger-dominated BH growth in low mass galaxies ($\lesssim 10^9~M_{\odot}$) and
accretion dominated BH growth in high mass ($\gtrsim10^9~M_{\odot}$) galaxies.
Furthermore, the scatter in the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation is
larger for the more restrictive models due to the inability of many BHs to grow
significantly beyond their seed mass.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19623v1" target="_blank"><h2>Power-law Emission-line Wings and Radiation-Driven Superwinds in Local

observed in 26 galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC) observations, primarily from
the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). Using Magellan/MIKE,
VLT/X-shooter, and WHT/ISIS high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that this
fast gas appears to probe the dominant feedback mechanisms linked to LyC
escape. We find that in 14 galaxies, the wings are best fit with power laws
with slopes -3.5 to -1.6, with four others best fit by Gaussians of width ~300
km/s; the remaining eight show ambiguous wing morphologies. Gaussian wings are
found only at low O32 = [O III]5007/[O II]3726,3729 and high metallicity, while
power-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence
suggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds
traced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian
wings. For the former, the < 3 Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population
correlates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that
radiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope
depend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction,
consistent with ``picket-fence" radiative transfer. Observed wing slope values
flatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still
preserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the
differential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas
are centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results
show that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape
in metal-poor starbursts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17565v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transient star B/R ratio and star formation in $z\gtrsim 1$ lensed

the detection of individual, luminous stars in lensed galaxies as transient
events, and hence provides a valuable window into the high mass stellar
population in $z>1$ galaxies. As these bright stars can only be formed at
specific ages, the relative abundance of transient events at blue (B) and red
(R) optical wavelengths ($B/R$ ratio) can provide insights into the star
formation history of lensed galaxies. Here, we forward model the transient
detection rates in an idealized mock scenario to find that the $B/R$ ratio of
strongly lensed $z>1$ galaxies decreases quickly with increasing age. This
ratio has comparatively low sensitivity to metallicity and dust attenuation,
with no significant dependency on the stellar initial mass function. As a
proof-of-concept, we show that a simple starburst cannot simultaneously fit the
$B/R$ and spectral energy distribution of the ``Warhol'' arc ($z = 0.94$),
indicating a more complex (recent) star formation history. Although limited
only to lensed higher redshift galaxies in cluster fields, this result shows
that the transient $B/R$ ratio could be used as an additional, complementary
constraint on the star formation history of higher redshift galaxies in future
works.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17376v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identifying Anomalous DESI Galaxy Spectra with a Variational Autoencoder</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  C.

Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provide tremendous discovery potential. In this
work we show how Machine Learning, in particular Variational Autoencoders
(VAE), can detect anomalies in a sample of approximately 200,000 DESI spectra
comprising galaxies, quasars and stars. We demonstrate that the VAE can
compress the dimensionality of a spectrum by a factor of 100, while still
retaining enough information to accurately reconstruct spectral features. We
then detect anomalous spectra as those with high reconstruction error and those
which are isolated in the VAE latent representation. The anomalies identified
fall into two categories: spectra with artefacts and spectra with unique
physical features. Awareness of the former can help to improve the DESI
spectroscopic pipeline; whilst the latter can lead to the identification of new
and unusual objects. To further curate the list of outliers, we use the
Astronomaly package which employs Active Learning to provide personalised
outlier recommendations for visual inspection. In this work we also explore the
VAE latent space, finding that different object classes and subclasses are
separated despite being unlabelled. We demonstrate the interpretability of this
latent space by identifying tracks within it that correspond to various
spectral characteristics. For example, we find tracks that correspond to
increasing star formation and increase in broad emission lines along the Balmer
series. In upcoming work we hope to apply the methods presented here to search
for both systematics and astrophysically interesting objects in much larger

astrochemical modeling except for the charge exchange process. However,
catalytic cycles involving these metals can affect the abundance of other
compounds. We prepared a comprehensive chemical network for Na, Mg, Al, Fe, K,
and Si-containing species. Assuming water as the major constituent of
interstellar ice in dark clouds, quantum chemical calculations were carried out
to estimate the binding energy of important metallic species, considering
amorphous solid water as substrate. Significantly lower binding energies
(approximately 5 to 6 times) were observed for Na and Mg, while the value for
Fe was roughly 4 times higher than what was used previously. Here, we
calculated binding energy values for Al and K, for which no prior guesses were
available. The total dipole moments and enthalpies of formation for several
newly included species are unknown. Furthermore, the assessment of reaction
enthalpies is necessary to evaluate the feasibility of the new reactions under
interstellar conditions. These parameters were estimated and subsequently
integrated into models. Some additional species that were not included in the
UMIST/KIDA database have been introduced. The addition of these new species,
along with their corresponding reactions, appears to significantly affect the
abundances of related species. Some key reactions that significantly influence
general metal-related chemistry include: $\rm{M^+ + H_2 \rightarrow M{H_2}^+ +
h\nu}$, $\rm{MH + O \rightarrow MO + H}$ ($\rm{M \ = \ Fe, \ Na, \ Mg, \ Al, \

magnetic fields (PMFs) and ambipolar diffusion on the ionization and thermal
history of the Dark Ages Universe ($30\le z\le300$), and its imprint on the
spectral profile of the global signal in the 21 cm hydrogen line. The heating
function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after
cosmological recombination, its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of
the PMFs $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power
spectrum of PMFs $n_{\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar
diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range
$-3\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim-1$, but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for
PMF models with $B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG. We computed the ionization and thermal
history of intergalactic gas from the cosmological recombination up to the end
of the Dark Ages epoch for a range of PMF parameters $0.05\lesssim

show that the profile of the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is very sensitive
to the PMF parameters from this range and can be used for their constraints in

sources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF,
we detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 $\mu$Jy rms sensitivity and
4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc)
with high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding
10$^5$ K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices ($>$ -0.5)
correlate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron
emission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star
formation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a
few cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio
emission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star
formation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a
contribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA
detections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type,
bulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and
star formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either
AGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections
correspond to extended, star-forming galaxies. We compare SFRs derived from
previous SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m observations with new JWST-based estimates, and
discuss the observed discrepancies, highlighting JWST's improved capability to

hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) has been detected in a number of galaxy
clusters, including the Coma cluster. The physical origin of this emitting
medium above hot ICM has not yet been determined, especially whether it be
thermal or non-thermal. We aim to investigate which gas phase and gas structure
more accurately reproduce the soft excess radiation from the cluster core to
the outskirts, using simulations. By using the simulation TNG300, we predict
the radial profile of thermodynamic properties and the Soft-X-ray surface
brightness of 138 clusters within 5 $R_{200}$. Their X-ray emission is
simulated for the hot ICM gas phase, the entire Warm-Hot medium, the diffuse
and low-density Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). Inside clusters, the soft
excess appears to be produced by substructures of the WARM gas phase which host
dense warm clumps (i.e, the Warm Circum-Galactic Medium, WCGM), and in fact the
inner soft excess is strongly correlated with substructure and WCGM mass
fractions. Outside of the virial radius, the fraction of WHIM gas that is
mostly inside filaments connected to clusters boosts the soft X-ray excess. The
more diffuse the gas is, the higher the soft X-ray excess beyond the virial
region. The thermal emission of WARM gas phase, in the form of WCGM clumps and
WHIM diffuse filaments, reproduces well the soft excess emission that was
observed up to the virial radius in Coma and in the inner regions of other
massive clusters. Moreover, our analysis suggests that soft X-ray excess is a
proxy of cluster dynamical state, with larger excess being observed in the most
unrelaxed clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18445v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparison of $R_h=ct$ and $Λ$CDM using DESI DR1 measurements</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kunj Panchal, Shantanu Desai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 1 figure.

Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that
encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the

are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable
candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the
accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo
catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical
properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the
resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body
simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and
OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a
given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the
different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each
simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify
cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics:
void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the
void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy
of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results.
We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\sigma} between
PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends.
This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics
with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17769v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dim cores of radio-bright AGN jets: VLBI and Gaia astrometry pinpoint

to determine the position of a point close to the brightest compact detail of
the source at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources
whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away
from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this
work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We
scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined
with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector
between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available
archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are
associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of
mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet
origin and are close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet
directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically
low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host
galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet
components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and

at the Galactic Centre (GC) may eject stars into the Galactic halo. While
recent fast ejections by Sgr A* have been identified in the form of
hypervelocity stars (hundreds to thousands km/s), it is also expected that the
stellar halo contains slower stars, ejected over the last few billion years. In
this study, we use the first data release of DESI to search for these slower GC
ejecta, which are expected to stand out from the stellar halo population for
their combined high metallicity (${\rm [Fe/H]}\gtrsim0$) and small values of
their vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$), whose distribution should peak at
zero. Our search does not yield a detection, but allows us to place an upper
limit on the ejection rate of stars from the GC of $\sim2.8\times10^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$ over the past ~5 Gyr, which is ejection model independent. This
implies that our result can be used to put constraints on different ejection
models, including that invoking mergers of Sgr A* with other massive black
holes in the last last few billion years.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18556v1" target="_blank"><h2>Circular Mystery: Exploring Diffuse Emission Surrounding a Radio Galaxy
  with uGMRT and VLA Multiwavelength Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shobha Kumari, Sabyasachi Pal, Souvik Manik</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Published in the Astrophysical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report the discovery of J1218+1813, a circular diffuse radio source
detected in the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey at 1400 MHz. The source has
an angular diameter of approximately one arcminute, corresponding to a physical
size of ~180 kpc, and is associated with an elliptical galaxy with a redshift
of z = 0.139635. To investigate its nature, we conducted a comprehensive
multiwavelength analysis spanning both high and low radio frequencies,
utilizing the VLA in C-configuration at L, C and X bands, along with the
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at bands 3 (250-500 MHz), 4
(550-850 MHz), and 5 (1000-1460 MHz). A spectral study based on these
multiwavelength observations reveals that the core of J1218+1813 exhibits a
steep spectral index of 0.8, indicating that the emission is dominated by
optically thin synchrotron radiation. The spectral index varies between 1.1 and
1.8, from the inner to the outer structure, with the steepest values observed
at the periphery of the diffuse emission. An optical analysis of the central
host galaxy using spectroscopic data is also performed. The estimated black
hole mass is $2.8 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{8}$ M${_\odot}$, while the host galaxy has
a stellar mass of 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M${_\odot}$ and a stellar age of 8.58
Gyr. The identification of J1218+1813 is particularly significant because it
provides insight into the mechanisms responsible for the formation of circular
diffuse radio structures surrounded by an elliptical galaxy. Potential
formation scenarios for J1218+1813 are discussed in this paper.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19099v1" target="_blank"><h2>Time dilation observed in Type Ia supernova light curves and its

that the passage of cosmic time varies throughout the evolution of the
Universe. This observation implies that the rate of proper time is not
constant, as assumed in the standard FLRW metric, but instead is
time-dependent. Consequently, the commonly used FLRW metric should be replaced
by a more general framework, known as the Conformal Cosmology (CC) metric, to
properly account for cosmic time dilation. The CC metric incorporates both
spatial expansion and time dilation during cosmic evolution. As a result, it is
necessary to distinguish between comoving and proper (physical) time, similar
to the distinction made between comoving and proper distances. In addition to
successfully explaining cosmic time dilation, the CC metric offers several
further advantages: (1) it preserves Lorentz invariance, (2) it maintains the
form of Maxwell's equations as in Minkowski space-time, (3) it eliminates the
need for dark matter and dark energy in the Friedmann equations, and (4) it
successfully predicts the expansion and morphology of spiral galaxies in

modern cosmology, posits a direct link between angular diameter distance and
luminosity distance. This study presents a comprehensive, model-independent,
and data-driven test of the CDDR using a combination of cosmological
observations, including Supernovae (SN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO),
and Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) measurements. We employ both Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR) and a novel Compressed Point (CPI) method for reconstructing
the CDDR, alongside four distinct parameterizations for potential deviations.
Nuisance parameters, such as the supernova absolute magnitude and BAO scale,
are rigorously handled via both joint numerical fitting (Method I) and analytic
marginalization (Method II). Our findings reveal that while direct
reconstruction of the CDDR exhibits no significant deviation (less than
1-$\sigma$) under specific prior assumptions, a notable departure emerges when
the SH0ES prior is incorporated, suggesting a systematic influence from the
Hubble constant tension. Independently, our parameterized analysis corroborates
the consistency of CDDR and confirms the equivalence of the two constraint
methodologies. We also find no significant evidence for cosmic opacity. A
comparative assessment of reconstruction techniques indicates that GPR
generally yields higher precision. These results emphasize the critical role of
prior choices and statistical methods in CDDR analyses, providing valuable
insights into fundamental cosmological principles and the ongoing Hubble
tension.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19373v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bar properties as a function of wavelength in Illustris TNG50: analysis

evolution, and properties like length, strength, and pattern speed. In
simulations, these are typically derived from particle positions and mass
distribution, neglecting stellar light and extinction effects. However,
observational studies indicate that bar appearance depends on wavelength. To
test whether this dependence exists in TNG50 at $z \sim 0$, we analysed 50
strongly barred galaxies using mock images from SKIRT radiative transfer
simulations covering infrared to ultraviolet filters (Spitzer 3.6 um, SDSS i,
r, g, S-PLUS J0378, GALEX NUV, and GALEX FUV). Bar ellipticity and length were
measured via ellipse fitting. Ellipticity generally increases by 6 percent from
3.6 um to g band, and by 9 percent to J0378 band. On average, TNG50 bars cannot
be said to be longer in bluer filters when the entire sample is used. However,
the trend is detected when only star-forming galaxies are considered. In this
star-forming subsample, bar length increases by 10 percent from 3.6 um to g
band, and by 17 percent to J0378 band; moreover, the bar can appear up to
20${-}$30 percent longer in bluer mocks than in the mass map. Over 90 percent
of bars vanish in UV due to minimal emission by dominant stellar populations.
We reproduced the bar properties morphological dependence phenomenon using
age-filtered mass maps, where older stars form shorter, rounder bars, and
younger stars generate longer, more elliptical ones. TNG50 bars exhibit a
wavelength-dependent trend similar to observations: bars appear more elliptical
and longer in bluer filters, with this effect being stronger in star-forming
galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18230v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the Pitfalls of CPL Parametrization at High Redshifts: A

Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, w(z) = w0 + wa * z / (1 + z),
using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 2
(DR2). While DESI BAO data broadly align with the standard LambdaCDM model,
giving Omega_m = 0.3, our Markov Chain Monte Carlo fits show notable variation
in best-fit values and degeneracy directions for w0waCDM across combinations of
BAO observables (DV/rd, DM/rd, DH/rd, and DM/DH).
  When constrained solely by DESI BAO data, the w0waCDM model shows internal
inconsistencies. Unlike LambdaCDM and wCDM, which fit all observables
consistently, w0waCDM predicts lower values for rd-dependent observables and
higher values for DM/DH. This conflict, including unphysical parameter
compensation at high redshift, reflects limitations of the CPL form, especially
its behavior at high redshift. The model compensates for poor individual fits
by inflating Omega_m and driving wa to large negative values.
  Our findings suggest that DESI DR2 BAO data alone do not robustly constrain
w0waCDM due to degeneracies and CPL limitations. These issues affect both
rd-based and ratio observables like DM/DH. We recommend applying dynamical dark
energy parametrizations directly to DV, DM, and DH measurements to better
constrain wa across redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17933v1" target="_blank"><h2>Holographic dark energy models in $f(Q,T)$ gravity and cosmic constraint</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xuwei Zhang, Xiaofeng Yang, Yunliang Ren, Shuangnan Chen, Yangjun Shi, Cheng Cheng, Xiaolong He</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> cosmic evolution (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we propose a new model that combines holographic dark energy

and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a
non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with
cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and
three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling
function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness
prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific
parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic
evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy
at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$
shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the
results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$
consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3
prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian
analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most
significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit
($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence
($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that
the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the
$\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit.
Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current
data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark
energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19166v1" target="_blank"><h2>What drives the growth of black holes: a decade of progress</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  D.

Galactic Nucleus (AGN: the observed manifestation of a growing SMBH) is an
"event" within the broader lifecycle of a galaxy, which can significantly
influence the shape and evolution of the galaxy itself. Our view of the
obscuring medium that affects the observed properties of an AGN has also
undergone a revolution, and we now have a more physical understanding of the
connection between the fuelling of (and feedback from) the SMBH and the broader
host-galaxy and larger-scale environment. We have a greater understanding of
the physics of SMBH accretion, can identify AGNs out to z = 8-10 witnessing the
very earliest phases of SMBH growth, and have a more complete census of AGN

innovative facilities, an ever-increasing quantity of multi-wavelength data,
the exploitation and development of new techniques, and greater community-wide
engagement. In this article we review our understanding of AGNs and the growth

stellar disk and study observational signatures of two-component stellar disks.
Assuming baryonic disks are in hydrostatic equilibrium, we solved the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation to estimate 3D density distribution. We used
integral-field spectroscopic observations to estimate stellar velocity
dispersion and built a 3D dynamical model using these density solutions and the
observed rotation curve. We generated simulated surface brightness maps and
compared them with observations to verify modeling consistency. The dynamical
model was inclined to 90{\deg} to produce an edge-on surface density map, which
we investigated by fitting different 2D functions and plotting vertical cuts in
logarithmic scale. We estimated vertical stellar velocity dispersion using an
iterative method, obtaining results consistent with the Disk Mass Survey
formalism. Through dynamical modeling, we produced moment maps that reasonably
matched observations. We examined the simulated edge-on model by taking
vertical cuts and decomposing them into multiple Gaussian components. We find
that artificial double Gaussian components arise due to line-of-sight
integration effects, even for single-component disks. This indicates that
decomposing vertical intensity cuts into multiple Gaussian components is
unreliable for multicomponent disks. Instead, an up-bending break visible in
logarithmic-scale vertical cuts serves as a more reliable indicator for
two-component disks. We performed 2D fitting on the edge-on surface density map
using the product of a scaled modified Bessel function and $sech^2$ function to
estimate structural parameters. These traditional methods systematically
underestimate the scale length and flattening ratio. Therefore, we suggest
using detailed modeling to accurately deduce stellar disk structural
parameters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18231v1" target="_blank"><h2>NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey: Blind detection of galaxy clusters in

formation, are unique cosmological probes. With the advent of large CMB surveys
like those from the Planck satellite, the ACT and SPT telescopes, we now have
access to a large number of galaxy clusters detected at millimeter wavelengths
via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Nevertheless, it is
interesting to complement them with high-angular-resolution (tens of
arcseconds) observations to target the lowest-mass and highest-redshift
clusters. This is the case of observations with the NIKA2 camera, which is
installed on the IRAM 30--m telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain. We used the
existing 150 GHz (2 mm) data from the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS)
Large Program to blindly search for galaxy clusters in the well-known COSMOS
field, across a 877 arcmin$^2$ region centered on (R.A., Dec.)$_{J2000}$ =
(10h00m28.81s, +02d17m30.44s). We first developed a dedicated data reduction
pipeline to construct NIKA2 maps at 2 mm. We then used a matched-filter
algorithm to extract cluster candidates assuming a universal pressure profile
to model the expected cluster tSZ signal. We computed the purity and
completeness of the sample by applying the previous algorithm to simulated maps
of the sky signal in the COSMOS field. We find a total of 16 cluster candidates
at S/N > 4, from which eight have either an optical or X-ray cluster (or group
of galaxies) counterpart. This is the first blind detection of clusters of
galaxies at mm wavelengths at 18" angular resolution. From this analysis, we
confirm that NIKA2 and the IRAM 30--m telescope should be sensitive to low-mass

computing the three-point correlation function (3PCF) of projected scalar
fields over the sky, this work investigates how much cosmological information
is contained in these higher-order statistics. We perform a forecast to
determine the number of harmonic multipoles required to capture the full
information content of the 3PCF in the context of galaxy weak lensing, finding
that only the first few multipoles are sufficient to capture the additional
cosmological information provided by the 3PCF. This study addresses a critical
practical question: to what extent can the high-dimensional 3PCF signal be
compressed without significant loss of cosmological information? Since the
different multipoles contain highly redundant information, we apply a principal
component analysis (PCA) which further reduces its dimensionality and
preserving information. We also account for non-linear parameter degeneracies
using the DALI method, an extension of Fisher forecasting that includes
higher-order likelihood information. Under optimistic settings, we find that
the 3PCF improves considerably the constraining power of the 2PCF for the
matter abundance $\Omega_m$ and fluctuations amplitude $\sigma_8$ by about 18%
for galaxy maps at redshift $z=0.5$. However, for the amplitude $S_8$ and the
equation of state parameter of dark energy, $w_0$, the improvements are very
modest. Thanks to the harmonic basis and PCA, the method can be implemented
with relatively low computational cost, providing a practical tool for current
and future photometric surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18968v1" target="_blank"><h2>A new window into the sub-parsec scale magnetic field in the Milky Way?

spatial fluctuations of the Faraday depth (FD) within the telescope beam. Such
FD fluctuations are referred to as "Faraday complexity", and can unveil
small-scale magneto-ionic structures in both the synchrotron-emitting and the
foreground volumes. We explore the astrophysical origin of the Faraday
complexity exhibited by 191 polarised extragalactic radio sources (EGSs) within
5 deg from the Galactic plane in the longitude range of 20-52 deg, using
broadband data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array presented by a previous
work. A new parameter called the FD spread is devised to quantify the spatial
FD fluctuations. We find that the FD spread of the EGSs (i) demonstrates an
enhancement near the Galactic mid-plane, most notable within Galactic latitude
of +-3 deg, (ii) exhibits hints of modulations across Galactic longitude, (iii)
does not vary with the source size across the entire range of 2.5"-300", and
(iv) has an amplitude higher than expected from magneto-ionic structures of
extragalactic origin. All these suggest that the primary cause of the Faraday
complexity exhibited by our target EGSs is <2.5"-scale magneto-ionic structures
in the Milky Way. We argue that the anisotropic turbulent magnetic field
generated by galactic-scale shocks and shears, or the stellar feedback-driven
isotropic turbulent magnetic field, are the most likely candidates. Our work
highlights the use of broadband radio polarimetric observations of EGSs as a

electrons in the post-recombination Universe. In the standard $\Lambda$ cold
dark matter cosmological model, the free electron density becomes large at
redshifts $z \lesssim 10$ due to the formation of the first stars, leading to
reionization of the intergalactic medium. In this work, we use \emph{Gaussian

history of the Universe constrained by the \textit{Planck} CMB measurements.
This method gives a consistent reconstruction of the standard reionization at
$z \lesssim 10$, and strongly constrains any additional high-$z$ reionization.
We use our results to construct a new derived parameter expressing the high-$z$

We investigate the impact of ambipolar diffusion on the development of

comprising charges and neutrals with the specific feature of differing gravity
between charges and neutrals. We derived the perturbed magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equations and obtained an analytic dispersion relation for an oblique
magnetic field. The growth rate was then evaluated using a numerical
integration of the dispersion relation. In particular, we focussed on the
anisotropy in the mode growth induced ambipolar diffusion. Results. In contrast
to the case of a magnetic field within the interface, an oblique magnetic field
is much less restrictive with respect to the wavenumbers that can develop;
rather than a sharp cut-off, it results in a selection of preferred scales for
mode growth. The presence of a second neutral fluid that is insensitive to
gravity tends to amplify the anisotropy in the possible direction of the
instability development. In particular, we show that this effect is maximal
when the coupling is in an intermediate range between full and no
charge-neutral coupling, specifically in the region where the ambipolar
diffusion is highest.</p></br></body>
