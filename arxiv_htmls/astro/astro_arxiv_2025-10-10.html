in the interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, with complex dust
compositions and large abundances already appearing at redshifts $z>6$. Here we
present a comprehensive, joint analysis of observations taken with the {\em
James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) and the Atacama Large
Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of the highly magnified, dusty `normal'
galaxy, A1689-zD1 at $z=7.13$. We perform detailed spectro-photometric modeling
of the rest-frame UV to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) based
on archival photometry of the source and report new rest-frame optical
strong-line measurements and metallicity estimates from recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU
data. We find that despite its substantial dust mass, $M_{\rm dust}\sim
1.5\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, A1689-zD1 has remarkably low dust-to-gas and
dust-to-metal mass ratios, ${\rm DTG} = (5.1^{+3.0}_{-1.9})\times 10^{-4}$ and
${\rm DTM} = (6.1^{+3.6}_{-2.3})\times 10^{-2}$, respectively, due to its high
metallicity $12+\log({\rm O/H}) = 8.36\pm 0.10$ and substantial gas mass,
$M_{\rm gas} = (2.8^{+0.2}_{-1.7})\times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. The DTG and DTM
mass ratios are an order of magnitude lower than expected for galaxies in the
local universe with similar chemical enrichment. These low relative
measurements are also corroborated by the deficit observed in the $A_V/N_{\rm
HI}$ ratio of A1689-zD1 in the line-of-sight. We find that this deviation in
the DTG and DTM mass ratios appears to be ubiquitous in other metal-rich
galaxies at similar redshifts, $z\gtrsim 6$. This suggests that the processes
that form and destroy dust at later times, or the dust emissivity itself, are
drastically different for galaxies in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07365v1" target="_blank"><h2>A JWST MIRI LRS Survey of 37 Massive Star-Forming Galaxies and AGN at

Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) targeting $37$
infrared-bright galaxies between $z=0.65-2.46$ with infrared luminosities $\log
L_{\rm IR}/L_\odot>11.5$ and $\log M_*/M_\odot=10-11.5$. Targets were taken
from a \textit{Spitzer} $24\,\mu$m-selected sample with archival spectroscopy
from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) and include a mix of star-forming galaxies
and dust-obscured AGN. By combining IRS with the increased sensitivity of LRS,
we expand the range of spectral features observed between $5-30\,\mu$m for
every galaxy in our sample. In this paper, we outline the sample selection,
\textit{JWST} data reduction, 1D spectral extraction, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) feature measurements from $\lambda_{rest}=3.3-11.2\,\mu$m. In
the \textit{JWST} spectra, we detect PAH emission features at $3.3-5.3\,\mu$m,
as well as Paschen and Brackett lines. The $3.3\,\mu$m feature can be as bright
as $1\%$ of the $8-1000\,\mu$m infrared luminosity and exhibits a tight
correlation with the dust-obscured star-formation rate. We detect absorption
features from CO gas, CO$_2$ ice, H$_2$O ice, and aliphatic dust. From the
joint \textit{JWST} and \textit{Spitzer} analysis we find that the
$11.3/3.3\,\mu$m PAH ratios are on-average three times higher than that of
local luminous, infrared galaxies. This is interpreted as evidence that the PAH
grains are larger at $z\sim1-2$. The size distribution may be affected by
coagulation of grains due to high gas densities and low temperatures. These
conditions are supported by the observation of strong water ice absorption at
$3.05\,\mu$m, and can lower stellar radiative feedback as large PAHs transmit
less energy per photon into the interstellar medium.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08455v1" target="_blank"><h2>A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at $z\simeq7.3$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jan-Torge Schindler, Joseph F.

high-redshift quasars -- J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z =
7.5$ -- which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z
\sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through
ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with
JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we
identify 51 $z>5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\Delta
v_{\textrm{LOS}}=\pm1500 \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window
from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713,
located just $7\,\rm{pkpc}$ and $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}} \approx
360\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling
candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the
galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy
cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of
$r_0^{\rm{QG}}\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, based on a
power-law model with a fixed slope of $\gamma_{\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the
assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter
density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\simeq7.3$
quasars of $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot})= 11.6\pm0.6$
in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\langle z

$\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) \gtrsim 12.3$), our
clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift
evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty
cycle of $f_{\rm{duty}}\approx0.1\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar
proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07596v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the evolution of the CO excitation ladder through
  cross-correlation of CONCERTO-like experiments and galaxy redshift surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mathilde Van Cuyck, Matthieu Bethermin, Guilaine Lagache, Alexandre Beelen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> molecular gas (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context: Rotational CO transitions, while acting as a foreground for [C II]
line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments, trace the physical conditions of cold
gas in galaxies at lower redshifts. Studying these transitions is also crucial
for improving component-separation methods as LIM sensitivity increases. Aims:
Galaxy-evolution models have so far predicted only the total CO LIM signal. We
explore the potential of cross-correlating millimeter-wave LIM data with
spectroscopic galaxy surveys to constrain individual CO-line contributions,
measure the CO-background spectral line energy distribution (SLED), and derive
the cosmic molecular gas density, $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$, up to $z = 3$.
Methods: We built 12 light cones of $9~\mathrm{deg}^2$ from the Simulated
Infrared Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) simulation. By analyzing cross-power spectra
between different CO transitions and the galaxy density field, we recovered the
CO background SLED. Combining it with bias-weighted line intensities yielded
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$. We also assessed the detectability of the CO(4--3)
cross-power spectrum with a CONCERTO-like experiment. Results: For a realistic
spectroscopic depth, the CO background SLED is accurately recovered up to
$J_{\mathrm{up}} = 6$ with $\leq 20%$ uncertainties. Reconstructing
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ from millimeter LIM data requires an excitation correction
relative to CO(1--0). Interloper-induced variance does not prevent precise
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimation. In the two-star-formation-mode SIDES model,
starbursts dominate the SLED at $J_{\mathrm{up}} \geq 6$ but do not bias
$\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimates from $2 \leq J_{\mathrm{up}} \leq 6$. However,
CONCERTO lacks the sensitivity to detect the CO$\times$galaxy cross-power on
relevant scales, even under ideal conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07952v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spin-Orbit Misalignments of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers in AGN Disks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gaia Fabj, Christopher Tiede, Connar Rowan, Martin Pessah, Johan Samsing</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a natural environment
where stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can dynamically pair, undergo repeated
interactions, and eventually merge. It is commonly assumed that gas accretion
will both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of
embedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially
positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions
have motivated the use of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying
candidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave
catalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly
planar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven
alignment prescription to characterize the expected
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By
comparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify
the regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary
properties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is
not. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they
merge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By
contrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity
$e_{10\mathrm{Hz}}\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques
to act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding
more isotropic $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and
torque efficiencies are modest. This interplay naturally establishes a
correlation between binary eccentricity and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in AGN disks,
highlighting a new key observable of the AGN channel and a potential
explanation for massive events such as GW190521 and GW231123.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07966v1" target="_blank"><h2>CHILES X: Molecular and atomic gas at intermediate redshift</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kelley M.

Abstract abridged for the arxiv submission</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), dust (abstract), atomic gas (title), molecular gas (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES
survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection
of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z>0.05)
to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses,
star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the
highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)>10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2
M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk,
consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass
of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of
log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems
detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit
broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with
both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the
galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the
redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of
obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but
the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with
samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular
gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples.
We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great
to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult
below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual
galaxies detected in HI between 0.1<z<0.23 for the foreseeable future due to
the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential
impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07369v1" target="_blank"><h2>$\texttt{geko}$: A tool for modelling galaxy kinematics and morphology

samples of galaxies across cosmic times. With the arrival of JWST, and its
NIRCAM grism mode, slitless spectroscopy can reach a medium spectral resolution
of $(R\sim 1600)$, allowing it to spatially resolve the ionised-gas kinematics
out to $z\sim 9$. However, the kinematic information is convolved with
morphology along the dispersion axis, a degeneracy that must be modelled to
recover intrinsic properties. We present the Grism Emission-line Kinematics
tOol ($\texttt{geko}$), a Python package that forward-models NIRCam grism
observations and infers emission-line morphologies and kinematics within a
Bayesian framework. $\texttt{geko}$ combines S\'ersic surface-brightness models
with arctangent rotation curves, includes full point-spread function (PSF) and
line-spread function (LSF) convolution, and leverages gradient-based sampling
via $\texttt{jax}$/$\texttt{numpyro}$ for efficient inference. It recovers
parameters such as effective radius, velocity dispersion, rotational velocity,
rotational support, and dynamical mass, with typical run times of $\sim$20
minutes per galaxy on GPUs. We validate performance using extensive mock data
spanning position angle, S/N, and morphology, quantifying where degeneracies
limit recovery. Finally, we demonstrate applications to real FRESCO H$\alpha$
emitters at $z\approx 4-6$, recovering both rotation- and dispersion-dominated
systems. $\texttt{geko}$ opens the way to statistical studies of galaxy
dynamics in the early Universe and is publicly available at

appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from
standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each
containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger
remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in
the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively
accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples
of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales.
Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in
jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy
significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to
uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers.
Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to
detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The
first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been
seen already.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07374v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stacking 21-cm Maps around Lyman-$α$ Emitters during Reionization:

will open a new window to probe the intergalactic medium during the formation
of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes. A particularly promising route
to an initial detection is to cross-correlate tomographic 21-cm maps with
spectroscopically confirmed Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). High-redshift LAEs
preferentially reside in ionized bubbles that are strongly anticorrelated with
the surrounding neutral regions traced by 21-cm observations. In this work, we
study the prospect of detecting such a cross-correlation signal by stacking
21-cm image cubes around LAEs using a current-generation 21-cm instrument --
the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). Our forecast adopts a
realistic mapping pipeline to generate foreground-free 21-cm image cubes. The
statistical properties of these images, arising from the complex instrumental
response, are carefully accounted for. We further introduce a physically
motivated signal template calibrated on the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations, which connects the cross-correlation amplitude to the global
neutral fraction. Our results show that a sample of ~50 spectroscopically
confirmed LAEs is sufficient to begin constraining the reionization history.
These results represent an important preparatory step toward joint analyses of
21-cm experiments with upcoming wide-area, high-redshift galaxy surveys from
Euclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07411v1" target="_blank"><h2>Is Liller 1 a building block of the Galactic bulge? -- Evidence with

centre, characterised by a wide spread in age and metallicity, indicating a
high mass. Liller 1 has been proposed to be a major contributor to the stellar
mass of the Galactic bulge, yet its origin is subject to debate. We employ
Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) data from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to test scenarios proposed to explain
the nature of Liller 1. Using a random sampling technique, we contrast the
chemical compositions of Liller 1 stellar members with those of the bulge,
inner disc, outer disk and solar neighbourhood. The chemistry of Liller 1
deviates from that of the bulge population at the 2-3$\sigma$ level for
$\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, and Ca. We conclude that the progenitor of Liller 1
was not a major contributor of stellar mass to the bulge. Furthermore, we find
the abundance pattern of Liller 1 to deviate at the 2$\sigma$ level from that
of inner disk stars, ruling out the cluster rejuvenation scenario. Finally, we
find that Liller 1 is chemically distinct from solar and outer disc
populations, suggesting that the progenitor of Liller 1 is unlikely to be an
in-situ massive clump formed at high redshift, from disc gravitational
instabilities, that migrated inwards and coalesced with others into the bulge.
Finally, we suggest that Liller 1 is a minor contributor to the stellar mass of
the inner Galaxy, possibly of extragalactic origin.</p></br></body>
