Fisk, Madeline A. Marshall, Phoebe R. Upton Sanderbeck, Jarrett L. Johnson</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title), halo (abstract), haloes (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect
of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes
in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy
distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can
produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in
surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is
available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or
direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to
an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III
host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute
self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We
include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray
portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas
collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to
cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner
radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form,
except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead
form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to
the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the
James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting
clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z
~ 15.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10099v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AURORA Survey: High-Redshift Empirical Metallicity Calibrations from

[SII] in deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 41 star-forming galaxies at
$z=1.4-7.2$ from the AURORA survey. We combine these new observations with 98
star-forming galaxies at $z=1.3-10.6$ with detected auroral lines drawn from
the literature to form a sample of 139 high-redshift galaxies with robust
electron temperature and direct-method oxygen abundance determinations. This
sample notably covers a wider dynamic range in metallicity than previous work,
spanning $0.02-0.9$~Z$_\odot$. We calibrate empirical relations between 19
emission-line ratios and oxygen abundance, providing a robust tool set to infer
accurate gas-phase metallicities of high-redshift galaxies when auroral lines
are not detected. While calibrations based on lines of $\alpha$ elements (O,
Ne, S, Ar) appear reliable, we find significant scatter in calibrations
involving lines of N driven by a high dispersion in N/O at fixed O/H,
suggesting that N-based line ratios are less reliable tracers of the oxygen
abundance at high redshift. These new high-redshift calibrations are notably
offset from those based on typical $z\sim0$ galaxy and HII region samples, and
are better matched by samples of extreme local galaxies that are analogs of
high-redshift sources. The new metallicity calibrations presented in this work
pave the way for robust studies of galaxy chemical evolution in the early
Universe, leading to a better understanding of baryon cycling and galaxy
formation from Cosmic Noon through the Epoch of Reionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11044v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST NIRCam Imaging of NGC 4258: I.

Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258, which hosts strong star formation regions as well
as an anomalous jet-like radio structure that extends through a significant
portion of its disk. This galaxy provides a unique environment to study Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven shocks and their impact on the interstellar
medium (ISM) as its proximity allows for narrow-band observations of various
near-infrared tracers sensitive to multiple levels of shock and radiative
excitation: [Fe II] (1.64 $\mu$m), Pa$\alpha$ (1.87 $\mu$m), H$_2$ (2.21
$\mu$m), 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, Br$\alpha$
(4.05 $\mu$m), and Pf$\beta$ (4.66 $\mu$m), allowing us to trace shocks with
parsec-scale resolution. Comparing these near-infrared observations with
available ultraviolet, optical, radio, and X-ray imaging, we find that shocks
present in the brightest regions of the anomalous radio structure are likely of
low-velocity (50-100 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting that these features originate
from AGN-driven winds that interact with the host medium and mechanically
impart energy into the disk. Further, while co-spatial [Fe II] and H$_2$
emission indicate multi-phase shocks, PAH emission is relatively weaker or
absent in the most shock-excited regions, consistent with the destruction of
small dust grains. Finally, we propose that surveys identifying enhanced [Fe
II] in AGN host galaxies may systematically reveal a key population where AGN
feedback is significantly coupled with the surrounding ISM and actively shaping
galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10709v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of

acquired high-resolution, spatially resolved polarimetric images of nearby
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the near ultraviolet (near-UV) band. Among the
25 individual targets in the polarized archives, 8 had no published analysis
until the beginning of this series of papers. We tackle the last 5 targets in
the following. In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging
polarimetry of AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially
resolved polarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78,
as well as near-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A
and 3C 109. We make use of the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the
first paper in this series to homogeneously analyze the five remaining
polarized observations of AGNs in the FOC archives. In Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, we
find a polarization pattern in the narrow-line regions consistent with
scattering from an obscured nucleus. For NGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV
polarization parallel with the inner radio jet, related to synchrotron
emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially resolved centro-symmetric
polarization patterns in both opposite outflows, highlighting the scattering
origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109 shows high nuclear polarization,
consistent with AGN-dominated emission and parallel with the radio axis, but in
tension with polarization arising from dichroic absorption invoked by previous
authors. The imaging polarimetry obtained for the narrow-line region and the
extended scattering medium surrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the
predictions of the unified AGN model and demonstrates the power of
spatially-resolved polarimetric observation to decipher the complex
morphologies at work in AGNs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10095v1" target="_blank"><h2>Emulating extended Lyman-alpha haloes around star-forming galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pengfei Li, Zheng Zheng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 15 figures, accepted by MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> CGM (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract), halo (title), haloes (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is commonly observed around star-forming
galaxies, opening a window for probing the neutral hydrogen gas in the
circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we develop a prescription of
spherically symmetric CGM gas properties and build emulators to model
circularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles of the extended Ly$\alpha$
emission. With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and
temperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the
neutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV)
background and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three
types of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems
with the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a
neutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in
between. Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\alpha$ radiative
transfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of
Ly$\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and
the recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict
Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\alpha$ sources, based
on Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT
simulations for each Ly$\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy
at the level of $\sim 20$ per cent. By applying the emulators to fit mock
Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles constructed from our model, we find a reasonable
recovery of model parameters, indicating the potential of extracting physical
information of the CGM and galaxies from the observed extended Ly$\alpha$
emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10895v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stars Born in the Wind: M82's Outflow and Halo Star Formation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Vaishnav V.

interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from
enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star
formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting
cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star
formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features
located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar
populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the
stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause,
with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations
are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst
aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star
clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star
formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In
the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and
cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star
formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds
associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the
halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star
formation, producing the observed episodic structure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10176v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining fuzzy dark matter with the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain
valuable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark
matter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark
matter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM)
on the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum
and the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are
implemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation
of the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM
halos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic
reionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark
matter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm
power spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a
correct FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when
X-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters
from upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In
FDM cosmologies with $m_\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to
constrain the boson mass to within $\sim10$% at 2$\sigma$ confidence with a
mock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent.
However, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate
with the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson
mass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10982v1" target="_blank"><h2>The extended molecular gas of the Circinus galaxy and NGC 1097 as seen

important events in a galaxy's evolutionary history such as outflows, inflows,
tidal interactions, and mergers, as well as dynamical structures affecting its
current evolution such as bars and spiral arms. Studying imprints of these
processes in the diffuse, extended molecular gas is best achieved by a single
dish telescope which can cover a large field of view with good sensitivity to
large-scale structures. In this work we present results from APEX line emission
maps of two nearby galaxies: the Circinus galaxy in the CO(3-2) transition, and
NGC 1097 in CO(2-1), covering their full optical extents. We detect gas at the
largest extents seen for these galaxies yet, at 5$^{\prime}$ ($r \approx 6$
kpc) for the Circinus galaxy, and $4^{\prime}.5$ ($r \approx 18$ kpc) for NGC
1097, and compute total CO luminosities of $L^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO(3-2)}} =
(1.5\pm0.4)\times10^{8}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$ and
$L^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO(2-1)}} = (7.0\pm1.7)\times10^{8}$ K km s$^{-1}$
pc$^{2}$, corresponding to molecular gas masses of $(2.1\pm1.0)\times10^{9}$
M$_{\odot}$ and $(4.7\pm1.9)\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively. We further
analyze the large-scale gas kinematics via PV diagrams and tilted ring modeling
using $^{\mathrm{3D}}$BAROLO. We detect notable features in both galaxies
beyond the well-studied central regions: in the Circinus galaxy we detect
molecular gas embedded in a bar-like structure, whose kinematic signature is
also evident in the major axis PV diagram, and in NGC 1097, we observe tidal
molecular gas involved in the interaction of NGC 1097 with the companion galaxy
NGC 1097A. The clear detection of such molecular gas structures shows promise
in conducting large-scale molecular gas studies toward nearby galaxies with
APEX and, in the future, the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope
(AtLAST).</p></br></body>
