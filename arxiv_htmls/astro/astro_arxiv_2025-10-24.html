the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These
simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench
massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To
address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic
Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the
mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation,
RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a
detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic
medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs
and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type
mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in
regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies.
We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited
current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to
disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19905v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of galactic winds fueling central starbursts and quasars in the

by either galaxy interactions or secular processes in gravitationally unstable
discs. We employ cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback in
Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to propose a new nuclear fueling scenario
based on the transition that galaxies undergo from bursty to smooth star
formation and from prominent global galactic winds to inefficient stellar
feedback as they grow above $M_{\star}\sim 10^{10-10.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$: the
last major galactic wind event shuts down star formation, evacuates gas from
the galaxy, and slows down gas accretion from the circumgalactic medium (CGM),
creating a $\sim$$10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ pileup of gas in the inner CGM
which later accretes coherently onto the galaxy, achieving a tenfold increase
in inflow rate over pre-outflow conditions. We explicitly track the
accumulation of gas along the outflow pathway owing to hydrodynamic
interactions and show that $\sim$50% of gas fueling the central
$\sim$10-100$\,{\rm pc}$ over the subsequent $\sim$15$\,{\rm Myr}$ can be
traced back to pileup gas having experienced $>$50% change in infall velocity
owing to the wind interaction. This galactic wind pileup effect may thus
represent a significant fueling mode for compact starbursts and luminous AGN.
Galactic winds at earlier times or AGN-driven outflows can have qualitatively
similar effects, but the pileup of gas driven by the last major galactic wind
event refuels the galaxy precisely when the deepening stellar potential
prevents further gas evacuation by stellar feedback, providing the ideal
conditions for quasar fueling at the time when AGN feedback is most needed to
regulate central star formation in massive galaxies at their peak of activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20083v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM/Resolve Spectroscopy of the Central Engine in the Seyfert-1 AGN

the ``central engine'' in active galactic nuclei, providing unique insights
into black hole accretion and feedback. We present an analysis of the first
XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk 279, known for its complex
line profiles and variability. The data reveal velocity components within the
Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line that can be associated with the inner face of the
molecular torus ($r \geq 10^{4}~GM/c^{2})$, the broad line region (BLR; $r =
1650^{+5780}_{-1480}~GM/c^{2}$), and the inner accretion disk ($r =
81^{+280}_{-75}~GM/c^{2}$). We find evidence of low-velocity, highly ionized
gas that contributes an H-like Fe XXVI emission line at 6.97 keV, confirming
suggestions from prior low-resolution spectra. The data do not show slow winds
in absorption, but two pairs of lines - consistent with He-like and H-like Fe
shifted by $v\simeq 0.22c$ and $v\simeq 0.33c$ - improve the fit, and could
represent an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). Their addition to the model only reduces
the Akaike Information Criterion by 3.6 and 3.5, respectively, signaling modest
support. Additional observations are needed to definitively test for the
presence of fast X-ray winds in Mrk 279. We discuss these results in the
context of the geometry of the central engine in AGN, emerging trends in XRISM
studies of AGN, and the nature of the potential UFOs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20021v1" target="_blank"><h2>Understanding Interstellar Metals during Reionization with Radiative SPH

observations of galactic nebular line emission during the Epoch of
Reionization, providing stringent tests of the predicted ionization and metal
enrichment levels. We validate the simulated population with the UVLF and
$M_{\mathrm{UV}}-M_*$ relation and see that the simulated results are
consistent with observations at lower masses. We extract local gas volumetric
grids of density and mass-weighted metallicity, then we use \texttt{Cloudy} to
produce synthetic emission spectra of \species{H}{ii} regions. The
mass-metallicity relation does not evolve, which is also consistent with
observations. The predicted oxygen abundance exceeds observational inferences
by about 0.5 dex, suggesting either overly efficient enrichment or weak
feedback. However, applying the O32 diagnostic directly to our synthetic
spectra shows an offset of 1 dex from the correct outputted gas-phase
metallicity. This suggests that O32 is biased high at a level that is more than
sufficient to account for the simulation-observation offset. The simulated
galaxies' line diagnostics show mostly weaker [\species{O}{iii}] lines and
lower diagnostic values of O3 and Ne3O2 compared to observations. This suggests
higher ionization parameters within the simulated galactic population in
general.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20664v1" target="_blank"><h2>Niebla: an open-source code for modelling the extragalactic background

Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), interstellar dust (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extragalactic very high-energy (VHE; $E>100\,$GeV) gamma rays suffer
absorption in interactions with photons of the Extragalactic Background Light
(EBL). The EBL is an isotropic diffuse photon field from optical to infrared
wavelengths, which is difficult to measure directly due to strong foreground
emission. We present niebla, the first open-source code to compute the EBL
using a forward-folding approach that accepts fully customizable inputs. This
software enables a detailed modelling of the influence of EBL opacities on VHE
observations and facilitates the distinction between different dust reemission
models. The code models the optical background primarily from stellar emission,
by evolving the spectrum of a single stellar population as a function of
redshift, considering mean metallicity evolution and star formation rate
density. Additional sources to the EBL can be provided by the user. The code
already includes optional contributions from, e.g., stripped stars, intra-halo
light, or the decay of axion dark matter. The optical emissivity is then
absorbed by interstellar dust and reemitted in the infrared regime. We provide
multiple prescriptions to model this process, using spectral dust templates or
a combination of blackbodies. We provide three EBL models calculated with
different dust reemission prescriptions, which have been fitted to various
observational data sets. In addition, we showcase the versatility of our model
through a simulated observation of the blazar Markarian 501 in a high-flux
state with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory array. We find that
the simulated VHE spectrum is highly sensitive to the EBL opacity coming from
the infrared. Our model will therefore allow the community to distinguish
between different dust reemission models and constrain EBL parameters with
future observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20172v1" target="_blank"><h2>Photometrically Selected Protocluster Candidates at z~9-10 in the JWST

galaxy clusters and the evolution of galaxies in dense environments. The James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity,
enables the first exploration of protoclusters beyond $z>$10. Among JWST
surveys, COSMOS-Web Data Release 0.5 offers the largest area $\sim$0.27
deg$^2$, making it an optimal field for protocluster searches. In this study,
we searched for protoclusters at $z\sim$9-10 using 366 F115W dropout galaxies.
We evaluated the reliability of our photometric redshift by validation tests
with the JADES DR3 spectroscopic sample, obtaining the likelihood of falsely
identifying interlopers as $\sim25\%$. Overdensities ($\delta$) are computed by
weighting galaxy positions with their photometric redshift probability density
functions (PDF), using a 2.5 cMpc aperture and a redshift slice of $\pm$0.5. We
selected the most promising core galaxies of protocluster candidate galaxies
with an overdensity greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution of 366
F115W dropout galaxies. The member galaxies are then linked within an angular
separation of 7.5 cMpc to the core galaxies, finding seven protocluster
candidates. These seven protocluster candidates have inferred halo masses of
$M_{\text{halo}} \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. The detection of such overdensities
at these redshifts provides a critical test for current cosmological
simulations. However, confirming these candidates and distinguishing them from
low-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies or Balmer-break galaxies will require
follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19925v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the Evolution of Disk-Embedded Binaries: Framing Local Models in

Pessah</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have in recent years been
recognized as possible sites for gravitational wave sources, leading to a
series of numerical studies on the evolution of disk-embedded black hole
binaries. The majority of these works have been carried out so far using the
shearing box, a local Cartesian domain co-rotating with the binary
center-of-mass around the supermassive black hole. The local nature of this
framework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the
expense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics.
In this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the
shearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of
the embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks. We accomplish this by
identifying the conditions under which relevant global timescales are longer
than the gas-induced evolution timescale of the embedded binary across various
AGN disk models. For black hole masses of interest, we report the existence of
radii beyond which the global influence of the disk may be reasonably
neglected, supporting the use of the shearing box. More generally, we introduce
a systematic approach to link local simulations with the global problem they
aim to approximate while providing a way to gauge their accuracy. This will
prove to be essential as we seek to add additional physics, such as magnetic
fields and radiative transport, to develop more realistic models for black hole
binary mergers and their potential electromagnetic signatures in AGN disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19863v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing Inflationary Imprints Through the Dark Ages: Implications for

oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The
variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of
overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the
Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze
primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling
and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation.
Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early
galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and
disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory
features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and
early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics

Submitted to Astrophysical Journal. Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> While the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detectors have
detected over 300 binary black hole (BBH) mergers to date, the first
confirmation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to such an event remains
elusive. Previous works have performed searches for counterpart candidates in
transient catalogs and have identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares
coincident with GW events; existing theory predicts that such flares may arise
from the interaction of the merger remnant with the embedding accretion disk
environment. We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of
coincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\% (90\%
credible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This
result still allows up to $\sim 40\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks.
We also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing,
determining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a
background population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are
consistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM
counterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive
AGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the
majority of the BBHs. We emphasize that developing both the means to
distinguish BBH counterpart flares from background AGN flares and an
understanding of which BBHs are most likely to produce AGN flares as
counterparts is critical to optimize the use of follow-up resources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20806v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the AGN Paradigm, Part I: a generic SED for Seyfert 1 galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Paulina Alejandra Roco-Avilez, Roger Coziol, Juan Pablo Torres-Papaqui, Karla Alejandra Cutiva-Alvarez, María Fernanda La Rotta-Wilches, César David Aguirre-Gutierrez, Angélica Gabriela Sandoval-Esparza</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 07 October 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), IGM (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This article presents the first part of a study aimed at testing the
unification paradigm for AGN (UPAGN) using the SED reconstruction code
X-CIGALE. Our method consists in obtaining a generic SED for a large sample of
Seyfert 1 (Sy1; part 1), then applying this SED to Seyfert 2 (Sy2; Part~II),
expecting that the only difference will be the line-of-sight (LOS) angle, $i$,
relative to the polar axis of the torus of gas and dust obscuring the broad
line regions (BLRs). Our sample is composed of 3,896 Type 1, Sy1 at low
redshifts, $ z < 0.4$, separated into four spectral subgroups depending on the
presence or absence in their spectra of narrow emission lines, Sy1N/Sy1B, and
AGN wind, Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw. The generic SED produced by X-CIGALE applies to 90\%
of the Sy1 in our sample. It includes a clumpy torus with an AGN engine seen
face-on ($i \sim 10^\circ \pm 5^\circ$). Our analysis not only supports the
existence of a torus in Sy1, in good agreement with UPAGN, but also reveals new
facts about the accretion of matter and AGN wind: 1- a sudden accretion of
matter from the BLR to the accretion disk triggered the wind, 2- matter from
the wind replenishes the torus, consistent with a gradual formation of this
structure by recurrent AGN winds, and 3- Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw eventually evolve as
AGN without wind, leaving behind a torus as evidence of a higher AGN activity

rare opportunities to observe multiple images of distant ($z\gtrsim2$) Type Ia
supernovae (SNe) and resolve the properties of their host galaxies. A recent
outstanding example is the Type Ia SN "H0pe" ($z=1.78$), discovered in James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images when it was still triply imaged by
the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165, $z=0.35$). In this work we build a
new strong lensing model of G165, first by using only the position of multiple
images of background galaxies. We then increase significantly the number of
constraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface
brightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model
parameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the
spatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the
position of SN H0pe. We find good statistical agreement of the extinction
estimate at $\lesssim1\sigma$ with three fully independent methods based on
spectral energy distribution fitting. Moreover, our extended-image lens model
of G165 allows us to map the dust distribution of the host galaxy from the
image plane to the source plane. Supernova H0pe exploded in a region with a
relatively high extinction of $A_V \approx 0.9\ {\rm mag}$ at around $\sim 1\
{\rm kpc}$ from its host center. This work shows that extended image modeling
in lensing clusters simultaneously reduces the uncertainty on lens model
parameters and enables spatially resolved analyses of lensed transients host
galaxies. Such modeling advances are expected to play an important role in
future cosmological analyses using strongly lensed SNe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20005v1" target="_blank"><h2>Eppur non si trovano: Comments on the Primordial Black Hole Limits in

photometric redshift estimates from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey and
T80S/S-PLUS iDR5, with custom photometric redshifts, we identify likely galaxy
cluster candidate members whose photometric redshifts are consistent with being
at the known redshift of the cluster and measure the average deviations of
their photometric redshifts with respect to the spectroscopic redshift
measurements {\sigma}NMAD. We have successfully compiled our
CHANCES-low-redshift catalogues, split into three different sub-surveys: low-z
bright (mr < 18.5), low-z faint (18.5 <= mr < 20.4) and low-z faint supplementary, by
selecting>= 500,000 galaxy cluster candidate members and including confirmed
spectroscopic galaxy cluster members, from which we expect to obtain 4MOST
low-resolution (R~6500) spectra for ~320,000 galaxies. The CHANCES Low-z target
catalogues form a statistically robust sample for spectroscopic follow-up,
allowing studies of galaxy evolution and environmental effects in nearby
cluster and supercluster environments.</p></br></body>
