  Galaxy Bimodality</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Avishai Dekel, Nir Mandelker, Zhaozhou Li, Zhiyuan Yao, Bocheng Zhu, Sharon Lapiner, Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury, Omri Ginzburg</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 13 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a mass-dependent bimodality in the early evolution of galaxies.
The massive track connects the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z>8$) to
the super-massive quiescent galaxies and black holes (BHs) at cosmic morning
($z=4-7$). The dark-matter halos $>10^{10.5}M_\odot$ at $z=10$ are expected to
undergo feedback-free starbursts (FFB) with high star-formation efficiency in
dense star clusters within compact galaxies. The less massive halos avoid FFB
and form stars gradually under stellar feedback, leading to the peak
star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon ($z=1-3$). The FFB and non-FFB halos
originate from $>4\sigma$ and $2-3\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The
post-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and
remain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows,
(b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams
within the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium
(CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key
for complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and
growth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence
or photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge. The cosmic-morning
quiescent galaxies are expected to be massive, compact, showing signatures of
compaction, outflows and AGN, with a comoving number density $\sim 10^{-5} {\rm
Mpc}^{-3}$, comparable to the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn and the AGN
at cosmic morning. Their UV luminosity function should peak about $M_{\rm uv}
\sim -22$ and contribute $\sim 10\%$ of the galaxies there.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11935v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIGHTEE-HI: The direct detection of neutral hydrogen in galaxies at

Ivy Wong</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Atomic hydrogen constitutes the gas reservoir from which molecular gas and
star formation in galaxies emerges. However, the weakness of the line means it
has been difficult to directly detect in all but the very local Universe. Here
we present results from the first search using the MeerKAT International Tiered
Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey for high-redshift ($z>0.25$) H{\sc
i} emission from individual galaxies. By searching for 21-cm emission centered
on the position and redshift of optically-selected emission-line galaxies we
overcome difficulties that hinder untargeted searches. We detect 11 galaxies at
$z>0.25$, forming the first sample of $z>0.25$ detections with an
interferometer, with the highest redshift detection at $z = 0.3841$. We find
they have much larger H{\sc i} masses than their low-redshift H{\sc i}-selected
counterparts for a given stellar mass. This can be explained by the much larger
cosmological volume probed at these high redshifts, and does not require any
evolution of the H{\sc i} mass function. We make the first-ever measurement of
the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFr) with H{\sc i} at $z>0.25$ and find
consistency with the local bTFr, but with tentative evidence of a flattening in
the relation at these redshifts for higher-mass objects. This may signify
evolution, in line with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, or that the
molecular gas mass in these high-mass galaxies could be significant. This study
paves the way for future studies of H{\sc i} beyond the local Universe, using
both searches targeted at known objects and via pure H{\sc i} selection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11685v1" target="_blank"><h2>HeII emitters in the cosmic noon and beyond. Characterising the HeII

Iglesias-Páramo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables. Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early
stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon',
when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin
of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a
systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from
the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec
data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive
gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron
densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising
photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar
mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar
multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission.
Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H)
> 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100
Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can
reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities,
models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300
Msol) and Zstar much lower < Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully
account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce
that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the
ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11280v1" target="_blank"><h2>Semi-empirical constraints on the HI mass function of star-forming
  galaxies and $Ω_{\rm HI}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from interferometric surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Francesco Sinigaglia, Alessandro Bianchetti, Giulia Rodighiero, Lucio Mayer, Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky, Ed Elson, Mattia Vaccari, Matt J. Jarvis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables. Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The HI mass function is a crucial tool to understand the evolution of the HI
content in galaxies over cosmic times and to constrain both the baryon cycle in
galaxy evolution and the reionization history of the Universe. We aim to derive
semi-empirical constraints at $z\sim 0.37$ by combining literature results on
the stellar mass function from optical surveys with recent findings on the
$M_{\rm HI}-M_\star$ scaling relation derived via spectral stacking analysis
applied to 21-cm line interferometric data from the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys,
conducted with MeerKAT and the VLA, respectively. We draw synthetic stellar
mass samples directly from the publicly-available results underlying the
analysis of the COSMOS2020 galaxy photometric sample. Afterwards, we convert
$M_\star$ into $M_{\rm HI}$ using analytical fitting functions to the data
points from HI stacking. We then fit a Schechter function to the median HIMF
from all the samples via MCMC. We finally derive the posterior distribution for
$\Omega_{\rm HI}$ by integrating the models for the HIMF built from the
posteriors samples of the Schechter parameters. We find evolution of the HIMF
at $z\sim 0.37$ with respect to results at $z\sim 0$ from the ALFALFA survey
and at $z\sim 1$ from uGMRT data. Our results for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ are in
broad agreement with other literature results, and follow the trend on
$\Omega_{\rm HI}$ as a function of redshift. The derived value $\Omega_{\rm
HI}=\left(7.02^{+0.59}_{-0.52}\right)\times10^{-4}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from the
combined analysis deviates at $ \sim 2.9\sigma$ from the ALFALFA result at
$z\sim 0$. We conclude that the HIMF and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ constraints that we
derive from state-of-the-art deep interferometric surveys suggest an evolution
of the HIMF and of the cosmic HI density, supporting a picture of smooth
transition of the HI content of galaxies from $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim 1$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10799v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas-Poor Hosts and Gas-Rich Companions of $z\approx$3.5 Radio AGN: ALMA
  insights into jet triggering and feedback</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wuji Wang, Carlos De Breuck, Dominika Wylezalek, Matthew D. Lehnert, Andreas L.

providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and
star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum
observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$,
focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within
projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of
these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the
AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at
0.2" resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by
re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our
sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}<L_{\rm
[CII]}/L_{\odot}<4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim
9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our
findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We
propose that these companions, which may be stripped clouds in merger process
and by interaction with the energy output from the AGN, could also be a trigger
of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g.,
shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In
general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are
impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circum-galactic or
proto-intracluster media.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11846v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Ultra-Faint, Chemically Primitive Galaxy Forming at the Epoch of

structure and chemical enrichment, yet direct observations of such primordial
systems remain elusive. Here we present James Webb Space Telescope
spectroscopic observations of LAP1-B, an ultra-faint galaxy at redshift
z_{spec}=6.625 +/-0.001, corresponding to a cosmic age of 800 million years
after the Big Bang, strongly magnified by gravitational lensing. LAP1-B
exhibits a gas-phase oxygen abundance of (4.2 +/- 1.8) x 10^{-3} times the
solar value, making it the most chemically primitive galaxy ever identified at
any epoch to date. The galaxy displays an exceptionally hard ionizing radiation
field, which is inconsistent with chemically enriched stellar populations or
accreting black holes, but consistent with theoretical predictions for
zero-metallicity stars. It also shows an elevated carbon-to-oxygen abundance
ratio for its metallicity in the interstellar medium, matching nucleosynthetic
yields expected from stellar population formed in the absence of initial
metals. The lack of detectable stellar continuum constrains the stellar mass to
<2700 Msun, while the dynamical mass, derived from emission-line kinematics,
exceeds the combined stellar and gas mass by more than two orders of magnitude,
indicating the presence of a dominant dark matter halo. These observations
establish LAP1-B as the most chemically primitive star-forming galaxy yet
identified, offering a rare window into the earliest stages of galaxy
formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11188v1" target="_blank"><h2>Patchy Helium and Hydrogen Reionization from the Kinetic
  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Neha Anil Kumar, Mesut Çalışkan, Selim C. Hotinli, Marc Kamionkowski, Simone Ferraro, Kendrick Smith</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 12 figures. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will measure
temperature fluctuations on small angular scales with unprecedented precision,
enabling improved measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect.
This secondary anisotropy has emerged as a valuable probe of the distribution
of ionized electrons in the post-recombination Universe. Although the
sensitivity of the kSZ effect has recently been utilized to study the
high-redshift epoch of hydrogen (H) reionization, its redshift-integrated
nature -- combined with anticipated improvements in measurement precision --
suggests that accounting for the later epoch of helium (He) reionization will
become increasingly important in the near future. Joint characterization of the
epochs will allow for a more coherent understanding of early-star and -quasar
formation, as these sources drive the ionization of H and He in the
intergalactic medium. In this paper, we extend the kSZ higher-order statistic
introduced by Smith \& Ferraro (2017) to forecast the ability of upcoming CMB
surveys to probe the morphology of both H and He reionization. Moreover, given
that upcoming large-scale structure surveys will trace density fluctuations at
redshifts overlapping with the epoch of He reionization, we propose a novel
cross-correlation between the kSZ higher-order statistic and galaxy survey
measurements. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of H and He
reionization, we show that next-generation CMB and galaxy surveys will have
sufficient statistical power to characterize the patchy morphology of H
reionization and set constraints on the redshift evolution of its He
counterpart.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11193v1" target="_blank"><h2>Submillimeter galaxy overdensities around physically associated quasar

the search for overdensities of massive star forming galaxies, such as
submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), around high-mass halos, including those hosting
quasars. In this work, we study the Megaparsec environment surrounding nine
physically associated quasar pairs between $z=2.45$ and $z=3.82$ with
JCMT/SCUBA-2 observations at 450 $\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m covering a field of view
of roughly 13.7 arcmin in diameter (or 32 Mpc$^2$ at the median redshift) for
each system. We identify a total of 170 SMG candidates and 26 non-SMG and
interloper candidates. A comparison of the underlying 850 $\mu$m source models
recovered with Monte Carlo simulations to the blank field model reveals galaxy
overdensities in all fields, with a weighted average overdensity factor of
$\delta_{\rm cumul} = 3.4 \pm 0.3$. From this excess emission at 850 $\mu$m, we
calculate a star formation rate density of $1700 \pm 100$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-3}$, consistent with predictions from protocluster simulations and
observations. Compared to fields around single quasars, those surrounding
quasar pairs have higher excess counts and more centrally peaked star
formation, further highlighting the co-evolution of SMGs and quasars. We do not
find preferential alignment of the SMGs with the quasar pair direction or their
associated Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, indicating that cosmic web filaments on
different scales might be traced by the different directions. Overall, this
work substantiates the reliability of quasar pairs to detect overdensities of
massive galaxies and likely sites of protocluster formation. Future
spectroscopic follow-up observations are needed to confirm membership of the
SMG candidates with the physically associated quasar pairs and definitively
identify the targeted fields as protoclusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11207v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a

Strubble, Tom Broadhurst</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 7 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based
on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed
systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program.
Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we
compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that
the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM
while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more
consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes
for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation.
We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the
critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens
of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new
lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with
great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as
long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and
study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening
microlenses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11601v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling a Population of Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lensed Faint Dusty

Submitted to the ApJL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The measurements of the number density of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses can be
used to put statistical constraints on the foreground mass distributions. Dusty
galaxies uncovered in submillimeter surveys are particularly useful in this
regard because of the large volume probed by these surveys. Previous
discoveries of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed dusty galaxies are predominantly the
brightest in the sky discovered by Herschel, SPT, and Planck. However, models
have also predicted a non-negligible fraction of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed
faint dusty galaxies, which were difficult to confirm due to technical
difficulties. Utilizing the deepest SCUBA-2 submillimeter survey, STUDIES, in
both the COSMOS and the UDS fields, together with a red JWST color selection
method, we discover a population of 13 strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty
galaxies. The rich ancillary data allow us to confirm their strongly lensed
nature via estimates of redshifts and lens modeling. Our systematic search has
allowed us to construct the 450$\mu$m number counts of strongly lensed sources
down to the flux levels about an order of magnitude fainter than previous
measurements. The measured lensing fractions of $\sim$1% are consistent with
predictions from models that also successfully produce the number density of
the strong galaxy-galaxy lensed bright dusty galaxies. Future searches from
Euclid and Roman are expected to discover orders of magnitude more strongly
lensed faint dusty galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11233v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black holes in cosmological simulations: growth prospects for
  supermassive black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lewis R. Prole, John A. Regan, Daxal Mehta, Peter Coles, Pratika Dayal</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe
could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed
since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these
PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we
have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink
to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions experience
significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\rm PBH}$ =
$10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\odot$, as
inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\rm PBH} =
10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow
to $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes
(IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such
as GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole
(BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding
prescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no
significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH
seeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and
showing that the $f_{\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold
above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the
first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological
simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10518v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the local supervoid solution to the Hubble tension with direct

To be submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around
the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in
redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in
near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local
Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the
Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local
expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the
Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to
direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4
compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void
density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of
less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by
Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local
Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or
$70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is
exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two
ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance
ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The
exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over
$1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models
produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from
CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such
estimates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11553v1" target="_blank"><h2>Circum-nuclear eccentric gas flow in the Galactic Center revealed by

galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared
to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on
the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy
group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of
radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we
investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any
excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of
the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used
spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across
the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to
detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due
to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background
effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN
likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5)
\times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure
profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting
in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we
estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of
$2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric
luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is
likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and
AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation.
Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the
accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11201v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling Gravitational Wave Bias from 3D Power Spectra of Spectroscopic

Leo Kim, Alex Krolewski, Suvodip Mukherjee, Ghazal Geshnizjani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Companion paper toarXiv:2411.11965, 44 pages, 18 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a framework for relating gravitational wave (GW) sources to the
astrophysical properties of spectroscopic galaxy samples. We show how this can
enable using clustering measurements of gravitational wave (GW) sources to
infer the relationship between the GW sources and the astrophysical properties
of their host galaxies. We accomplish this by creating mock GW catalogs from
the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 galaxy survey. We
populate the GWs using a joint host-galaxy probability function defined over
stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity. This probability is
modeled as the product of three broken power-law distributions, each with a
turnover point motivated by astrophysical processes governing the relation
between current-day galaxy properties and BBH mergers, such as galaxy quenching
and BBH delay time. Our results show that GW bias is most sensitive to
host-galaxy probability dependence on stellar mass, with increases of up to
$\sim O (10)\%$ relative to galaxy bias as the stellar mass pivot scale rises.
We also find a notable relationship between GW bias and SFR: when the
host-galaxy probability favors low-SFR galaxies, the GW bias significantly
increases. In contrast, we observe no strong correlation between GW bias and
metallicity. These findings suggest that the spatial clustering of GW sources
is primarily driven by the stellar mass and SFR of their host galaxies and
shows how GW bias measurements can inform models of the host-galaxy probability
function.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11269v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of an HI 21 cm absorption system at z=2.327 with CHIME</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  CHIME Collaboration, Mandana Amiri, Arnab Chakraborty, Simon Foreman, Mark Halpern, Alex S.

small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions

GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we
investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can
resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with
the latest measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model

French, Rongmon Bordoloi, Brad Koplitz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication on JATIS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> How gas gets into, through, and out of galaxies is critical to understanding
galactic ecosystems. The disk-CGM interface region is uniquely suited for
studying processes that drive gas flows. Matter and energy that enter and leave
a galaxy pass through this region; however, the precise pathways are yet to be
explored. In this paper, we discuss future observations that will facilitate
the discovery of the gas flow pathways in galaxies and the telescope parameters
necessary for making those observations. We advocate for high spectral
resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities on the Habitable Worlds
Observatory (HWO) that will enable observations in a wavelength range of 940 -
3500 A (minimum range: 970 - 3000 A) and at a resolution of 100,000 (minimum of
50,000). We advocate 19 for a multi-object spectrograph with thousands of
sub-arcsec slitlets and a field of view 6' x 6'. We also recommend that the
spectrograph be sensitive enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or
higher within a few hours for a continuum source of 21 AB magnitude and
estimate an optimal aperture size of 8 meters. These capabilities would enable
the characterization of gas in the disk-halo interface, leading to
breakthroughs in our understanding of the gas flows and galactic ecosystems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10734v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): III.

stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO)
Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6
setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the
$\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in
$\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong
correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux
densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong
correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2
fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two
sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we
find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of
$\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk
masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid
of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these
mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination
of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses
are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint
disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk
masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between
$10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11596v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hydroxylated Mg-rich amorphous silicates as catalysts for molecular

Ouerfelli</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present results from an experimental study on the interaction of atomic
deuterium with Mg-rich amorphous enstatite and forsterite type silicates.
Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the process. During D atom exposure,
deuteroxyl group formation was observed. The cross section for OD group
formation, estimated from the OD stretching band intensity with D atom fluence,
is 4.2.10^{-18} cm^2 for both silicates. HD (D2) molecules form via D atom
abstraction of chemisorbed H(D) atoms from OH (OD) groups, with a cross section
of 7.0.10^{-18} cm^2. Quantum chemical calculations on enstatite and forsterite
amorphous nano-clusters were used to analyze chemisorption and abstraction
energies of H atoms. The formation of OH groups on forsterite is barrierless,
while enstatite has a small energy barrier. H2 abstraction from hydroxyl groups
is barrierless in both silicates. The results support our interpretation of IR
spectral changes during D atom exposure as addition and exchange reactions,
with catalytic molecular deuterium formation. These findings, obtained at 300
K, are relevant to astrophysical environments like photodissociation regions
and interstellar clouds at lower temperatures. Amorphous silicates, like carbon
grains, undergo hydrogenation in the diffuse interstellar medium due to
interactions with atomic hydrogen and UV photons. The detection of these
components on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko connects primitive solar system
objects to interstellar dust, offering new insights into their evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10740v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VI.

dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA
Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three
star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the
observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust
evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of
models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with
different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and
dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth,
weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any
observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The
observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible
with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$,
suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of
the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and
sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are
consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The
evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an
unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular
resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from
comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive
disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10549v1" target="_blank"><h2>Origin of Radio Emission in Three Nearby Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies

Hayashi, Yoshiaki Hagiwara, Masatoshi Imanishi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 2.3
and 8.4GHz of three nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, identified via
mid-infrared spectroscopic analyses as hosting deeply embedded active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal
compact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744,
accounting for $\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The
non-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4
GHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no
conclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of
$10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the
mid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object
exhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further
investigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three
galaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse
kpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One
possible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced
particle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum,
characteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening
attributable to this AGN activity. Consequently, the spectral steepening at
high frequencies arises from particles accelerated by merger dynamics or AGN
activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11216v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxies at the edges: a complete census of MACS J0416.1-2403 cluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rossella Ragusa, Maurizio D'Addona, Amata Mercurio, Marcella Longhetti, Marisa Girardi, Marianna Annunziatella, Nicolas Estrada, Claudio Grillo, Angela Iovino, Giula Rodighiero, Piero Rosati, Benedetta Vulcani, Giuseppe Angora, Hans Bohringer, Massimo Brescia, Gabriel Bartosch Caminha, Gayoung Chon, Fedor Getman, Aniello Grado, Marco Gullieuszik, Luca Limatola, Alessia Moretti, Luisa Pecoraro</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in the A&A journal. 16 pages, 9 figures, and 1 table</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Numerous studies have established that the environment influences the
physical properties of a galaxy. While gas inflows supply the fuel for SF, high
density and temperature conditions suppress SF activity through various
quenching processes. Investigations into large scale structures, such as
filaments and overdense regions in the cluster outskirts, have focused on the
low z. To move to intermediate z and explore galaxy pathways combined with
environmental effects, it is crucial to join wide field spectroscopy and deep
photometry. Our primary objective is to spectroscopically analyze the
photometric overdensities observed by Estrada et al.(2023) in the outskirts of
massive cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397), interpreted as evidence of ongoing
group infall, i.e. the pre processing scenario, and to investigate the behavior
of galaxies in the outskirts about their g-r color, Mstar, and local density,
emphasizing the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution. We conducted
a spectroscopic analysis out to 5.5R200, using the AAOmega spectrograph. The
large FoV and depth allowed us to explore galaxies up to the cluster periphery
and across a wide Mstar range, reaching down to the limit of dwarf galaxies.
Redshifts were obtained through independent but comparable methods: Redrock,
EZ, and Redmost. We identified 148 new spectroscopic cluster members from a
sample of 1236 objects. We found 81 galaxies located in filamentary and
overdense regions, supporting the role of filamentary infall in the cluster
mass assembly history. Our analysis revealed that galaxies in high density
regions are more massive, redder, and more passive, compared to galaxies in low
density regions that appear to be bluer, less massive, and more SF. These
findings underscore the significance of environmental effects and the role of
pre processing in shaping galaxy properties before cluster infall.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11943v1" target="_blank"><h2>Calibrating baryonic effects in cosmic shear with external data in the

by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on
small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of
the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects
and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we
generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and
astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon
Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to
which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the
cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of
baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and
determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to
avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that
long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this
threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised
gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge,
however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment
should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11845v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemo-dynamics of the stellar component of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy II:

testing dark matter (DM) models and baryonic feedback implementation in
simulations. The Sculptor 'classical' dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a system with
two distinct stellar populations and high-quality data, offers a remarkable
opportunity to study DM distributions in these galaxies. In this work, we infer
the DM halo density distribution of Sculptor, applying a method based on
spherically symmetric distribution functions depending on actions to fit the
stellar structural and kinematic properties of Sculptor. The galaxy is
represented via four components: two distinct stellar populations based on
distribution functions, tracers within a fixed and dominant DM potential, plus
the contribution of a third stellar component that accounts for possible
sources of contamination. The model-data comparison accounts for the kinematics
and metallicities of individual stars, allowing us to assign probabilities of
membership to each star. The modeling is applied on the largest available set
of spectroscopic data, which have not been previously analyzed with this
objective. We find the DM distribution of Sculptor to have a logarithmic inner
slope of 0.39+0.23-0.26 and a scale radius of 0.79+0.38-0.17 kpc at 1 sigma
confidence level. Our results show that Sculptor DM density profile deviates
from predictions of DM-only simulations at a 3 sigma level over a large range
of radii. Our analysis suggests that the velocity distribution of Sculptor's
two main stellar components is isotropic in the center and becomes radially
anisotropic in the outskirts. Additionally, we provide predictions for the
projected radial and tangential velocity dispersion profiles. We also present
updated DM annihilation and decay J- and D-factors, finding J = 18.15+0.11-0.12
and D = 18.07+0.10-0.10 for an angular aperture of 0.5 degrees.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11792v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Karl G.

determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we
investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously
unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric
distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We
obtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field
unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting
red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial
velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six
elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated
estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +-
0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7
kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +-
0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and
indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance
ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both
clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +-
0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for

associated with both a short central cooling time ($t_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^9 \,
{\rm yr}$) and accumulations of cold gas ($\lesssim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$). Also,
the central ratio of cooling time to freefall time is rarely observed to drop
below $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$, and large accumulations of cold gas
are rarely observed in environments with $t_{\rm c} / t_{\rm ff} \gtrsim 30$.
Here we show that the critical range -- $10 \lesssim t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}
\lesssim 30$ -- plausibly results from magnetized thermal instability. We
present numerical simulations of magnetized stratified atmospheres with an
initially uniform magnetic field. Thermal instability in an otherwise static
atmosphere with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$ progresses to nonlinear
amplitudes, causing cooler gas to accumulate, as long as the background ratio
of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is $\beta \lesssim 100$. And in
atmospheres with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 20$, cooler gas accumulates for
$\beta \lesssim 10$. Magnetized atmospheres are therefore much more likely to
precipitate than unmagnetized atmospheres with otherwise identical properties.
We hypothesize that AGN feedback triggered by accumulations of cold gas
prevents $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ from dropping much below 10, because cold gas
inevitably precipitates out of magnetized galactic atmospheres with lower
ratios, causing $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ to rise.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10542v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) V: properties of volume-limited

crucial for our understanding of planet formation, yet it has proven hard to
constrain observationally, due both to the difficulties of measuring gas masses
and the lack of a homogeneous sample. Here we present a large grid of
thermochemical models which we use to measure protoplanetary gas disk masses of
AGE-PRO, the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. AGE-PRO
covers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with
ages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations
of CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes
out. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time,
from 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (<1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4
Msun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6
Myr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass
distributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to
survivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO
emitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does
not significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco. From Lupus to Upper Sco
the median gas-to-dust mass ratio increases by a factor ~3 from ~40 to ~120,
suggesting efficient inward pebble drift and/or the formation of planetesimals.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11363v1" target="_blank"><h2>FAUST XXVII: The circumbinary disk and the outflow of the L 1551 IRS 5

the large ALMA program FAUST, we studied the structure of the protostellar
binary system L1551 IRS5 at scales between 30 and 3,000 au to constrain its
properties, from the circumstellar and circumbinary disks up to the envelope
and outflow scales, which exhibits complex and entangled structures at the
scales of its inner and outer envelopes, presumably caused by the influence of
the central binary. Assuming a dust-to-gas ratio of 100, we calculated the
dust+gas mass for the circumbinary disk and each circumstellar disk of the
binary, obtaining 0.018 M$_{\odot}$, for the circumbinary disk, 0.004
M$_{\odot}$, and 0.002 M$_{\odot}$, for the northern and southern circumstellar
disk respectively. From the line emission, we retrieved the gas masses for each
structure component. With the $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ PV diagram along
the circumbinary disk, we were able to constrain the centrifugal barrier,
$r_{CB}=55$ au, update the specific angular momentum,
$j\sim270$~au~km~s$^{-1}$. We built an analytical model that can be used to
predict the influence of the morphology of the outflow and a few dynamic
features that can reproduce the system emission, allowing us to explain and
discern the outflow contribution from the complex emission due to the binary.
Additionally, we inferred the density power law index, $\alpha=1.7$, and the
envelope rotation velocity, $v_{c}=2$~km~s$^{-1}$. Finally, the observations
gave us the physical constraints to obtain a coherent outflow model for L1551

protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually
interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to
the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of
the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of
the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions.
We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre
wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the
nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum
observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent
emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the
image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1)
emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less
than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness
coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity
of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the
product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature
of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary
systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet
undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object,
the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar
surface or a strong accretion burst.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10749v1" target="_blank"><h2>Strömgren photometric metallicity map of the Magellanic Cloud stars

consequences of its past dynamical interactions that influenced its shape. By
measuring the metallicity distribution of stellar populations with different
ages, one can learn about these interactions. The Magellanic Clouds, being the
nearest pair of interacting dwarf galaxies with a morphology characterised by
different tidal and kinematic sub-structures as well as a vast range of stellar
populations, represent an excellent place to study the consequences of
dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions and with their large host, the Milky Way. We
aim to determine the metallicities ([Fe/H]) of red giant branch (old) and
supergiant (young) stars covering the entire galaxies, estimate their radial
metallicity gradients and produce homogeneous metallicity maps. We use the XP
spectra from Gaia Data Release 3 to calculate synthetic Str\"omgren magnitudes
from the application of the GaiaXPy tool and adopt calibration relations from
the literature to estimate the metallicities. We present photometric
metallicity maps for ~90,000 young stars and ~270,000 old stars within ~11 deg
of the Small Magellanic Cloud and ~20 deg of the Large Magellanic Cloud from a
homogeneous dataset. We find that the overall radial metallicity gradients
decrease linearly in agreement with previous studies. We apply
piecewise-regression fitting to derive the gradients within different radial
regions. The overall metallicity gradients, traced by young and old stars,
decrease from the centre to the outskirts of both galaxies. However, they show
multiple breakpoints depicting regions following different and sometime
opposite trends. These are associated to the structure of the galaxies, their
history of star formation and chemical evolution but may be influenced by a low
number of sources, especially at the centre (due to crowding) and in the
outermost regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11931v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effective supernova dust yields from rotating and non-rotating stellar

at high redshift. However, the reverse shock generated by the interaction of
the SN forward shock and the interstellar medium (ISM) significantly reduces
the mass of newly formed dust in SN ejecta. This study quantifies the mass,
composition, and grain size distribution of surviving dust after the passage of
the reverse shock using the GRASHrev model. Our analysis covers a grid of SN
models with progenitor masses $13\,M_\odot\leq m_\star\leq120M_\odot$,
metallicity $-3\leq\text{[Fe/H]}\leq0$, and rotation velocities $v = 0$ and
$300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The SN explosions occur in a uniform ISM with
densities $n_\text{ISM} = 0.05, 0.5$, and $5\text{ cm}^{-3}$. We find that the
larger grains ($\gtrsim10\text{ nm}$) are more resistant to destruction by the
reverse shock, with amorphous carbon dominating the surviving dust mass in most
models. The surviving dust mass decreases with increasing ISM density. For
non-rotating progenitors, the maximum mass of dust surviving the passage of the
reverse shock is $\simeq 0.02\,M_\odot$ released by SN explosions of a
$120\,M_\odot$ progenitor with $\text{[Fe/H]}=0$ in the ISM density
$0.5\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to $\simeq4\%$ of the initial dust mass
before the passage of the reverse shock. Among rotating progenitors, a maximum
surviving mass fraction is $\simeq5\%$ with a final dust mass
$\simeq0.03\,M_\odot$ in $\text{[Fe/H]}=-1$ models. Although the reverse shock
has a strong destructive impact, our results indicate that, on very short
timescales, SNe can enrich the ISM with carbonaceous grains ranging in size
from approximately $1\text{ nm}$ to $100\text{ nm}$ (up to
$\simeq1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ in non-rotating models). This is notable given the
detection of the 2175 \r{A} extinction bump in galaxies at $z>6$, suggesting
the early presence of such dust.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10719v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): I.

(AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and
size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully
selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming
regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr).
Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary
paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus
disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and
Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm
Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on
different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio,
which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($<$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks,
and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes
range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller
than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest
that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk
properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a
declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models
overestimate gas masses of $>$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we
discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation
and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11840v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar Velocity Dispersion versus Age: Consistency across Observations
  and Simulations, with the Milky Way as an Outlier</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fiona McCluskey, Andrew Wetzel, Sarah Loebman, Jorge Moreno</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages (30 with references and appendices), to be submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Within disk galaxies, the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of stars increases
with age, $\tau$, as measured in the Milky Way (MW) and nearby galaxies. This
relation provides a key window into galactic formation history, tracing both
the kinematics of stars at birth and the dynamical heating of stars after
birth. We compile and compare observational measurements of the MW, M31, M33,
and 16 galaxies from the PHANGS survey. The MW exhibits significantly colder
stellar kinematics, with 2-3 times lower $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ at a given
age, than all but one other observed galaxy. Therefore, the MW is a kinematic
outlier. To assess how measurement effects influence $\sigma(\tau)$, we analyze
the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, quantifying the impact of uncertainties in
stellar age, aperture size, galactocentric radius, and galaxy inclination.
Aperture size and galactocentric radius affect $\sigma(\tau)$ by up to a factor
of $\approx2$ for stars younger than 100 Myr, with milder effects on older
stars. Age uncertainties up to 40\% change the \textit{value} of $\sigma(\tau)$
at a given age by $\lesssim20\%$ but can reshape the relation with age and
erase merger signatures. We compare $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ in FIRE-2
simulations with observations. FIRE-2 agrees well with M31 and M33 at all
measured ages, and with PHANGS for stars older than $\approx500$ Myr. The
average $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ in FIRE-2 is about two times higher than the
MW at most ages, but the youngest stars show better agreement. The velocity
ratios ($\sigma_{\phi}/\sigma_{R}$, $\sigma_{Z}/\sigma_{\phi}$,
$\sigma_{Z}/\sigma_{R}$) in FIRE-2 broadly agree with the MW. We conclude that
$\sigma(\tau)$ in FIRE-2, and most cosmological zoom-in simulations, reasonably
matches observed nearby galaxies, but matching the MW is rare, because it is a
kinematic outlier.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12004v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bayesian and frequentist perspectives agree on dynamical dark energy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Laura Herold, Tanvi Karwal</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 8 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) show evidence of a deviation from a cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ within a Bayesian analysis. In this work, we validate that
frequentist constraints from profile likelihoods on the
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameters $w_0$, $w_a$ are in excellent agreement
with the Bayesian constraints when combining with Planck cosmic microwave
background, Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing, and either
Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey Y5 supernova data. Further, we assess which
datasets drive these constraints by considering the contributions to the
$\chi^2$ from the individual datasets. For profile likelihoods of the matter
fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, such an investigation shows internal
inconsistencies when assuming $\Lambda$, which are resolved when assuming a
$w_0w_a$ dark-energy model. We infer the equations of state $w(z)$ at the pivot
redshifts, supporting previous interpretations that current data appears to be
more sensitive to the derivative of $w(z)$ rather than a mean offset from
$\Lambda$. Thus our frequentist analysis corroborates previous findings on
dynamical DE.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11568v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing the outer disk of eXtended-UV galaxies in the optical

Galaz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 10 figures, accepted in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Aims : Extended-UV (XUV) galaxies are galaxies presenting an extended outer
ultraviolet disks. Although some Giant Low Surface Brightness (GLSB) galaxies
are also XUV, their relation has been seldom studied. This work aims to
determine whether a sample of nine XUV galaxies can be classified as GLSBs, by
analyzing their photometric properties in deep optical images. Method : The
method presented here uses optical data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to
construct surface brightness (SB) profiles for each galaxy. A characteristic UV
radius is defined to examine the XUV disks. The surface brightness profiles are
fitted using simple exponential functions, and the extracted parameters are
compared with the literature to identify possible GLSB galaxies. We examined
also other diagnostics, including color profiles. Results : The analysis of the
optical surface brightness profiles of XUV galaxies reveal that they can be
classified into three different families. One third meet the GLSB criteria in
terms of diffuseness, another third are regular, and the remaining have a
stronger decline in the outer disk than in the inner disk, opposite to GLSBs.
The color profiles allowed us, in addition to distinguish one of the galaxy,
NGC1140, likely resulting from a rare dwarf-dwarf merger.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11758v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the
  Weighted Function Regression method</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alex González-Fuentes, Adrià Gómez-Valent</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 36 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with
CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$
CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the
DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor
expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary
and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake
spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of
DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to
eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We
assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior
distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic
approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities,
examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa
likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE.
Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for
the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and
SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence
at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies
between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a
simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim
2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark
energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the
Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the
Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic
biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11278v1" target="_blank"><h2>C and N abundances in globular clusters. I. The case of 47 Tuc and the

both photometric and spectroscopic data. In this study, we investigate chemical
variations in the globular cluster NGC104 (47Tucanae), aiming to trace multiple
stellar populations across evolutionary phases and examine how the C/N
anti-correlation evolves from the main sequence (MS) to the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB). We also assess the impact of these populations on the
interpretation of the V vs. V-I diagram. [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] abundances are
obtained from CN and the CH features, while atmospheric parameters are
homogeneously derived from photometry. The inferred abundances allow us to
disentangle multiple populations along the CMD and refine cluster parameters.
We find that MS stars are more C- and N-rich than their red giant branch,
horizontal branch, and AGB counterparts. The C/N anti-correlation shifts during
the sub-giant branch phase, coinciding with the first dredge-up. Interestingly,
stars with different C and N abundances occupy distinct regions of the V vs V-I
diagram, a pattern not attributable to differential reddening. Proper CMD
fitting requires two isochrones with differing helium content, metallicity, and
possibly age.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11755v1" target="_blank"><h2>Phase space and Data analyses of a non-minimally coupled scalar field

Shahalam</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models non-minimally
coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and
parameterized coupling {\xi}. First, we study the cosmological dynamics for a
recently proposed Q-SC-CDM model. Initially, we choose two distinct values of
{\xi}: 0.1 and 0.5. In case of {\xi}=0.1, the evolution of the universe is
split up into three different phases: deceleration, acceleration and
slow-contraction, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future.
However, in case of {\xi}=0.5, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes,
correspondingly Big Crunch Singularity is redundant. Second, we perform the
phase space analysis for Q-SC-CDM, bring new asymptotic regimes and find stable
de-Sitter solution. Finally, fixing {\xi} to two representative values: {\xi} =
0.1 and 0.05, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent
late-time cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type
Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI
DR2) data. Our results demonstrate that both models yield constraints on key
cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are
consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild
tension with Pantheon+ measurements. We analyze the evolution of the effective
equation of state, showing that the model transitions from a stiff matter phase
at high redshift to a dark energy dominated phase with effective equation of
state less than -0.5 at late times. Additionally, we employ the Om(z)
diagnostic to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM, finding minimal
deviation up to redshift z \sim 2. Statistical model comparison using Akaike
(AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) Information Criteria reveals moderate support for the
model with {\xi} = 0.1, though {\Lambda}CDM remains statistically preferred.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11826v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing Coasting Cosmologies with Large-Scale Structure Growth</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dávid A.

0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\,

${\sigma_{8}(z=0)=\{1.071^{+0.213}_{-0.151},\,0.867^{+0.128}_{-0.097},\,0.725^{+0.080}_{-0.065}\}}$.
Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM model yielded
${\{\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053},\,\sigma_{8}(z=0)=
0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}\}}$. All four models are consistent with the data,
though coasting models are weakly favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with
$\log$-Bayes factors of ${\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{0.197,\,
0.234,\,0.272\}}$. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved
by linear expansion restricted to $z<2$. The curve fitting yielded
${S_8=\{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}}$
for the ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ coasting models, respectively, resulting in
${\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{1.94\sigma,\,1.07\sigma,\,0.52\sigma\}}$
discrepancies with the standard $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 value. The tension level
was the highest for the $\Lambda$CDM model, as the constraint from our fit is
$S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta
S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}=2.00\sigma}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10400v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar Ancestry Unlocked: Chemical and Orbital Clues Link Metal Poor
  Stars to Globular Clusters and the Galaxy's Thick Disk</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gizay Yolalan, Timur Şahin, Selçuk Bilir, Olcay Plevne</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 35 pages, including 18 figures,10 tables, accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This study presents a detailed chemical, kinematic, and orbital dynamic
analysis of five metal poor stars in the solar neighborhood: HD 2665, HD 5916,
HD 122956, HD 189349, and HD 218857. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data
from the ELODIE and ESPaDOnS instruments, we derived elemental abundances for
29 species (25 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Sm) via LTE based analysis with
ATLAS9 model atmospheres. Notably, we report first time detections of Ce and Nd
in HD2665; Al, V, Sm, and Mn in HD5916; Al in HD 122956; and C, O, S, Sc, Mn,
Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, Zr, Nd, and Sm in HD 189349. Dynamical and chemical diagnostics
reveal distinct origins: HD 2665 shows strong orbital and chemical similarity
to GC NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), while HD 218857 exhibits chemodynamic signatures
consistent with NGC 5634. HD 122956 aligns with NGC 6864 (M75), though
intriguingly shares age, metallicity ([Fe/H]), and [Mg/Fe] ratios with NGC
6517, a cluster whose reported abundances are derived solely from one star with
APOGEE $H$-band spectroscopic measurements, as no optical spectroscopic data
exist for its members. In contrast, HD 5916 and HD 189349 exhibit kinematic and
chemical properties consistent with the field-star population and are
classified as thick disk members.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11306v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of Faint Nebulosity Around a Z Camelopardalis-type Cataclysmic

Thorstensen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted by The Astronomical Journal</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report our discovery of a faint nebula surrounding a previously
little-studied 15th-mag variable star, ASASSN-19ds, in the southern-hemisphere
constellation Antlia. Spectra verify that the star is a cataclysmic variable
(CV). Using new and archival photometry, we confirm that ASASSN-19ds is an
eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.139 days (3.34 hr). Moreover, its
out-of-eclipse brightness shows a "sawtooth" light curve with an amplitude of
$\sim$1~mag and an interval between peaks that varies between about three to
nearly five weeks. Its mean absolute magnitude in the Gaia system is
$M_G=+6.5$. These combined properties lead to a classification of ASASSN-19ds
as a Z Camelopardalis-type CV. We obtained deep narrow-band images of the
nebulosity, using modest-sized telescopes and extremely long exposure times.
Our imagery reveals a bipolar morphology, with thin arcs at the ends of the
major axis, likely indicating an interaction with the interstellar medium. We
consider several scenarios for the origin of the nebula, but from the existing
information we are unable to distinguish between it being ejecta from an
unobserved classical-nova outburst several centuries ago, or an ancient
planetary nebula. Future observations should be able to decide between these
possibilities. At the star's distance of only $\sim$557 pc, a nova eruption
would have been a spectacular naked-eye event.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11260v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large-Scale-Structure Observables in General Relativity Validated at

observables in cosmological perturbation theory, specifically the "cosmic
rulers and clock", which are the building-blocks of any other
large-scale-structure observable, including galaxy number counts, on large
scales. We calculate the scalar rulers (longitudinal perturbation and
magnification) and the cosmic clock to second order, using a fully non-linear
covariant definition of the observables. We validate our formulae on three
non-trivial space-time metrics: two of them are null tests on metrics which are
obtained by applying a gauge transformation to the background space-time, while
the third is the "separate universe" curved background, for which we can also
compute the observables exactly. We then illustrate the results by evaluating
the second-order observables in a simplified symmetric setup. On large scales,
they are suppressed over the linear contributions by $\sim 10^{-4}$, while they
become comparable to the linear contributions on mildly non-linear scales. The
results of this paper form a significant (and the most complicated) part of the
relativistic galaxy number density at second order.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11299v1" target="_blank"><h2>Geometric Cosmology models: statistical analysis with observational data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Matías Leizerovich, Luisa G.

This is the main motivation for exploring alternative cosmological models. In

action. We obtain the late-time background evolution for three families of
models that can be obtained from this proposal. We use recent data from Cosmic
Chronometers and type Ia supernovae to test the late-time predictions of our
models. In addition, we consider estimations from the Age of the Older Globular

by the data, we show that there are particular cases of the GILA model that can
explain current data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11383v1" target="_blank"><h2>SpiralMap: A Python library of the Milky Way's spiral arms</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Abhay Kumar Prusty, Shourya Khanna</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 4 figures.

perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly
affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism
to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary
orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the
merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs
greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces
distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the
canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto
\nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in
future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test
the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10768v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detectability of massive binary black holes with sub-mHz gravitational
  wave missions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Renjie Wang, Yumeng Xu, Gang Wang, Bin Hu, Rong-Gen Cai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to
explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective
being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic
distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization
capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences.
Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We
evaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and
precessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization
performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a
two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is
considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes.
These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations,
thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz
missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with
LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to
their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved
localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger
astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with
sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and
alternative theories of gravity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10469v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of
  binary black hole mergers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fumihiro Chuman, Masamune Oguri</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct
measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the
high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they
offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the
dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing.
We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the
redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave
sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the
luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular
clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the
auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in
future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between
the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We
demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the
auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with
galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of
gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10684v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical tests of cosmological Alfvén waves with Ohmic diffusion</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Orestis A. Karapiperis, Matthieu Schaller</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Physical problems with a solution that can be expressed analytically are
scarce; this holds even more true for problems set in a cosmological context.
Such solutions are, however, invaluable tools for making comparisons between
theory, numerical experimentation and observations. In this work we present
what to our knowledge is the first set of non-trivial closed-form expressions
describing the behaviour of a system governed by the equations of non-ideal
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effects of Ohmic diffusion are
considered, in a cosmologically expanding frame. We provide analytical
solutions that describe the time evolution of linear perturbations to a
homogeneous background in a radiation-dominated universe, yielding dissipative
Alfv\'en waves. Although in our base framework solutions for any other
cosmology of interest cannot be expressed in a closed form, they can still be
obtained reliably through numerical integration of the coupled system of
ordinary differential equations we provide. We compare our analytical solutions
to numerical results obtained using our novel implementation of Smoothed
Particle Magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) in the SWIFT astrophysical simulation
code, to find good agreement between the two. We find the code to display good
convergence behaviour, its predictions agreeing with theory to within 0.1% for
a modest number of resolution elements and at a negligible computational cost.
We aim this work as a companion and supplement to the cosmological ideal MHD
wave tests recently presented in the literature, and suggest that it be adopted
as part of standard testing of code implementations of MHD.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11531v1" target="_blank"><h2>Addressing the $H_0$ tension through matter with pressure and no early
  dark energy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Youri Carloni, Orlando Luongo, Marco Muccino</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose that the Hubble tension arises due to an unaccounted additional
component, that behaves as \emph{matter with pressure}. We demonstrate that
this fluid remains subdominant compared to both dust and radiation throughout
nearly the entire universe expansion history. Specifically, the additional
fluid satisfies the Zel'dovic limit with a constant equation of state,
$\omega_s > 0$, and a quite small normalized energy density, $\Omega_s$.
Accordingly, this component modifies both the sound horizon and the background
expansion rate, \emph{acting quite differently from early dark energy models},
without significantly affecting the other cosmological parameters. To show
this, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis of our model, hereafter
dubbed $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM paradigm, using the publicly available
\texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code. Our results confirm the presence of this fluid,
with properties that closely resemble those of radiation. We find best-fit
values that satisfy $\omega_s \lesssim \omega_\gamma$ and a relative energy
density $\Omega_s / \Omega_\gamma = 0.45$, with $\omega_r$ and $\Omega_r$ the
equation of state and density of photons, respectively. The effective fluid may
be associated with generalized K-essence models or, alternatively, with
Proca-type vector fields, albeit we do not exclude \emph{a priori} more exotic
possibilities, i.e., dark radiation, axions, and so on. Physical implications
of our results are analyzed in detail, indicating a statistical preference for
the $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM scenario over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM
background.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10414v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variation in the size of the Photon Sphere and Black Hole Shadow in the

  Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sukhdeep Singh Gill, Somnath Bharadwaj</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 8 figures. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a fast and scalable estimator for the binned multi-frequency
angular bispectrum (MABS) and the 3D bispectrum (BS) of the redshifted 21 cm
signal from radio interferometric observations. The estimator operates on
gridded visibilities and leverages the FFT-based acceleration to efficiently
compute the MABS and the 3D BS covering all possible triangle configurations.
We present the formalism and validate the estimator using simulated visibility
data for a known input model BS, considering the Murchison Widefield Array
(MWA) observations with a bandwidth of $30.72$ MHz centered at $154.25$ MHz. We
consider two cases, namely, without flagging, and with flagging, which has
exactly the same frequency channels flagged as the actual data. We obtain
estimates of the BS for a wide range of triangle shapes covering the scales
$0.003 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\leq k_1 \leq 1.258 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The estimated
BS shows excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the input
model BS. We find that the deviations, which are below 20\% even in the
presence of flagging, are mostly consistent with the expected statistical
fluctuations. This work paves the way for reliable observational estimates of
the 21 cm BS for the epoch of reionization, where the signal is predicted to be
highly non-Gaussian.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10547v1" target="_blank"><h2>$α$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT

incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized
Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations
and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model
observational viability against recent high-precision data, primarily from the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) combined with Planck, DESI
BAO, and BICEP/Keck 2018 observations (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Our results indicate
that while the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) for $N_*=60$ lies
near the $2\sigma$ boundary of the P-ACT-LB-BK18 dataset, the inclusion of GUP
effects significantly shifts the predictions for the scalar spectral index
$n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Notably, for the GUP parameter
$\beta$ values surpassing approximately $10^{13}$, the model predictions are
shown to fall well within the 68\% CL region of this combined observational
data, enhancing its consistency. The viable parameter space in the
$\alpha-\beta$ plane is explored, revealing that a maximum $\alpha \simeq 0.74$
is consistent with the 68\% CL for $\beta \simeq 1.4\times 10^{13}$. In
addition, for smaller values of $\alpha$, the predictions of the model remain
inside the 68\% CL region for larger values of $\beta$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11797v1" target="_blank"><h2>InflationEasy: A C++ Lattice Code for Inflation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Angelo Caravano</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-lat, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 1 figure; the code is publicly available atthis https URL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> InflationEasy is the first lattice code specifically developed for

finite-difference spatial derivatives and a staggered leapfrog integrator for
time evolution. Based in part on the well-known LATTICEEASY, it incorporates
several improvements tailored to inflationary applications. Among other
features, InflationEasy implements a nonperturbative $\delta N$ method to
compute the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation $\zeta$ directly
from the lattice, enabling fully nonlinear studies of scenarios with large
fluctuations or nonperturbative non-Gaussianities. The code supports a broad
range of inflationary models, including those relevant for primordial black
hole formation, gravitational wave production, and large-scale structure. This
makes InflationEasy a versatile and lightweight tool for studying inflationary

exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational
wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a
useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this
class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable,
signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the
Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during
which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of
whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation.
We provide a set of conservative criteria for sustained thermalization in an
axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We
find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of
the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as
non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the
possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</p></br></body>
