05189$-$2524, with XRISM during its performance verification phase. The
unprecedented energy resolution of the onboard X-ray microcalorimeter revealed
complex spectral features at $\sim$7$-$9 keV, which can be interpreted as
blueshifted Fe XXV/XXVI absorption lines with various velocity dispersions,
originating from ultra-fast outflow (UFO) components with multiple bulk
velocities of $\sim0.076c$, $\sim0.101c$, and $\sim0.143c$. In addition, a
broad Fe-K emission line was detected around $\sim7$ keV, forming a P Cygni
profile together with the absorption lines. The onboard X-ray CCD camera
revealed a 0.4$-$12 keV broadband spectrum characterized by a neutrally
absorbed power-law continuum with a photon index of $\sim2.3$, and intrinsic
flare-like variability on timescales of $\sim10$ ksec, both of which are likely
associated with near-Eddington accretion. We also found potential variability
of the UFO parameters on a timescale of $\sim140$ ksec. Using these properties,
we propose new constraints on the outflow structure and suggest the presence of
multiple outflowing regions on scales of about tens to a hundred Schwarzschild
radii, located within roughly two thousand Schwarzschild radii. Since both the
estimated momentum and energy outflow rates of the UFOs exceed those of
galactic molecular outflows, our results indicate that powerful, multi-velocity
UFOs are already well developed during a short-lived evolutionary phase
following a major galaxy merger, characterized by intense starburst activity
and likely preceding the quasar phase. This system is expected to evolve into a
quasar, sustaining strong UFO activity and suppressing star formation in the
host galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18398v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Census of Double-Peaked Lyman-alpha Emitters in MAGPI: Classification,

into gas kinematics and the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) from the
interstellar to the intergalactic medium (ISM to IGM), and serve as valuable
diagnostics of ionising Lyman continuum (LyC) photon escape. We present a study
of the global and spatially resolved properties of double-peaked Ly$\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) based on VLT/MUSE data from the MAGPI survey. From a parent
sample of 417 LAEs at z = 2.9 - 6.6 in the first 35 fields, we identify 108
double-peaked LAEs using an automated peak classification technique. We measure
a double-peak fraction of $\sim37\%$ at $z < 4$, decreasing to $\sim14\%$ at $z
> 4$, likely due to enhanced IGM attenuation. Approximately $17\%$ of the
double-peaked LAEs are blue-dominated, suggesting gas inflows. The
blue-to-total flux ratio exhibits a luminosity dependence: fainter lines
generally show higher blue flux, though some luminous sources also show strong
blue peaks. We find a narrowing of the red peak at $z > 4$, despite the
presence of the blue peak, indicating intrinsic galaxy evolution rather than
IGM attenuation. Several LAEs exhibit residual flux in the absorption trough,
with normalised trough flux anticorrelating with peak separation, reflecting
variations in HI column density. We further investigate spatially resolved
properties of ten red-dominated LAEs with extended Ly$\alpha$ halos. Despite
azimuthal variations, both the blue-to-total flux ratio and normalised trough
flux density increase with radius, while peak separation decreases. The red
peak asymmetry shows only minor radial changes. These trends are consistent
with variations in shell outflow velocity and HI column density across the
halos. Based on peak separation, red peak asymmetry, and residual trough flux,
we identify five LAEs as strong LyC-leaker candidates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18069v1" target="_blank"><h2>Time-evolving diagnostic of the ionized absorbers in NGC 4051. I.

Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using two XMM-Newton high-resolution Reflection
Grating Spectrometer (RGS) observations. The spectra reveal three distinct
layers of photoionized gas flowing outward from the central black hole: a
low-ionization phase (LIP), a higher-ionization phase (HIP), and a
high-velocity and high ionization phase (HVIP). Each absorber leaves
characteristic imprints on the soft X-ray spectrum. While the LIP and HVIP are
fully consistent with being in ionization equilibrium with the central
radiation field over the course of the $\sim$250 ks spanned by the two
observations, the HIP shows a significant change in ionization ($3.8\sigma$),
suggesting non-equilibrium. By modeling the two spectra with our time-dependent
photoionization code (TEPID), we constrain the density of the HIP gas to $\log
n_{\rm H}=7.7^{+0.2}_{-0.9}$ and estimate its distance to be about
$R=0.45^{+0.80}_{-0.09}$ light-days from the black hole, corresponding to
$R=4000^{+7000}_{-800}$ gravitational radii. In contrast, the narrow soft X-ray
emission lines remain constant, consistent with an origin in the more extended
narrow-line region. Our results show the value of combining high-resolution and
time-resolved spectroscopy to probe the structure, physical conditions, and
variability of AGN outflows.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17996v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the Stellar Feedback-driven Breathing Mode in Low-mass Galaxies

star-formation can produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies. A key
prediction is that feedback-driven gas outflow and inflow cycles can lead to
``breathing modes'' (rapid fluctuations in the global gravitational potential)
which drive correlated variations in galaxy size, kinematics, and
star-formation rate. In this paper, we test the dynamical effects of
feedback-driven breathing modes using a sample of 103 star-forming low-mass
galaxies with stellar masses between $7.9<\rm \log M_*/M_\odot<9.6$ and
$0.02<z<0.19$. We measure ionized gas velocity dispersions from H$\alpha$
emission lines and compare them to mock observations from the FIRE-2
simulations. We compare gas velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{gas}$), stellar
masses, and specific star-formation rates (sSFR). We find a positive
correlation between gas velocity dispersion residuals at fixed stellar masses
($\rm \Delta\sigma_{gas}$) and sSFR in both data and simulations. However, the
relation is tighter in FIRE-2 compared to the data. FIRE-2 produces more
low-sSFR galaxies compared to our observational sample, however, the sSFR
distributions agree after limiting both samples to a minimum sSFR. A deeper and
more complete photometric sample further indicates that observed low-mass
galaxies could span the full range of sSFR predicted in the FIRE-2 simulations.
Our results support the existence of short-timescale dynamical effects driven
by gas outflow and inflow cycles in low-mass galaxies and motivate additional
tests of the breathing mode.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17968v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and

histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from
resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass
functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of
high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), beyond the current JWST detection
limits ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$). Previous works considered only intact
low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as
stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show
that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to $\sim50\%$ of the total stellar
mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at $z =6-9$. Including all the progenitors of
these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs
by factors of $\sim2-3$ and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by
$\sim20-40\%$. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution
limit of the simulations, near $M_\star$ $\sim$ $10^{5}$ $M_\odot$ or
$M_{\mathrm{UV}} \sim -10$ at $z \gtrsim 6$. We also show that `fossil record'
reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single
reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude
thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes.
Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates
the contribution of galaxies with $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim -15$ to the
reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant
fraction ($\sim50\%$) of streams with $M_\star$ $\gtrsim$ $10^{6}$ $M_\odot$ at
$z=0$ should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space
Telescope observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17980v1" target="_blank"><h2>FLAMINGO: Tracing the co-evolution of hot gas and black holes in galaxy

quantity for constraining the impact of feedback processes on large-scale
structure. While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas
fraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we
note that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has
not been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical
simulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive
black holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than
previously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH
mass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH
masses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with
previous studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun
the correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in
haloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes
through cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and
subsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and
feedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading
to earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to
haloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate
that present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly
shaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that
can be tested with future observational measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18764v1" target="_blank"><h2>Linking Electron Density with Elevated Star Formation Activity from

ApJL in press</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift galaxies exhibits
significantly higher electron densities ($n_{\rm e}$) than in the local
universe. To investigate the origin of this trend, we analyze a sample of 9590
centrally star-forming galaxies with stellar masses greater than
$10^9\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.01 < z < 0.04$, selected from the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. We derive electron densities
from the [S~II]~$\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet, measuring values of $n_{\rm
e} = 30$-$400~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ at $z \approx 0$. We find a tight correlation
between $n_{\rm e}$ and the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$), which is well described by a broken power law. Above a threshold of
$\log(\Sigma_{\rm SFR} / M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}) \ge -1.46$, the
relation follows $n_{\rm e} = (233 \pm 13)\,\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.49 \pm 0.02}$.
Below this threshold, $n_{\rm e}$ remains approximately constant at $44 \pm
3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$. Remarkably, this relation remains consistent with
measurements of galaxies at $z = 0.9$-$10.2$. By converting the observed
redshift evolution of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ into $n_{\rm e}$ evolution through our
$n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation, we obtain $n_{\rm e} =
40(1+z)^{1.4}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, consistent with previous direct observations. The
$n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation likely arises because the high
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, fueled by dense cold gas or elevated efficiency, enhances
radiative and mechanical feedback and produces dense ionized gas whose electron
densities are further regulated by ambient pressure. We conclude that the
redshift evolution of $n_{\rm e}$ primarily reflects the evolution of cold gas
density and star formation activity over cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18248v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Stellar and nebular dust attenuation of

physical properties of galaxies. We present an analysis of dust attenuation in
18 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming main-sequence galaxies at $z =
4.4-5.7$ observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU and NIRCam, selected from the ALPINE
and CRISTAL ALMA large programs. We fit the emission line fluxes from NIRSpec
and the broad-band photometry from NIRCam with Prospector, using both spatially
integrated emission and $\sim0.6$ kpc pixel-by-pixel measurements. We derive
the stellar-to-nebular dust attenuation ratio
($f=E(B-V)_{\mathrm{star}}/E(B-V)_{\mathrm{neb}}$) from the SED fits and the
Balmer decrement with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. Although individual galaxies show
large scatter, the best-fit value is $f = 0.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$, slightly
higher than that measured for local starburst galaxies. We find weak
correlations of $f$ with galaxy properties, increasing with higher specific
star-formation rates, younger stellar ages, and more recent star-formation. For
the range of $E(B-V)_{\mathrm{star}} = 0.009-0.15$ mag for in our sample,
assuming $f = 1$ (often adopted in high-redshift studies) instead of $f = 0.51$
underestimate line luminosities and ionizing photon production efficiency
$\xi_\text{ion}$ by $\sim3-36\%$ and $\sim4-46\%$, respectively. We also find
that the total stellar masses estimated from spatially-integrated SED fits with
a delayed-$\tau$ star-formation histories are systematically smaller than the
sum of pixel-by-pixel SED fits, with a median offset of $\sim 0.26$ dex, likely
because the integrated fits are biased toward luminous young stellar

primordial CMB B-modes. Its signal presents a complex behavior in frequency
space inherited from the joint variation in our Galaxy of the orientation of
magnetic fields and of the spectral properties of dust grains aligned with
magnetic field lines. In this work, we present a new framework for analyzing
the thermal dust signal using polarized microwave data. We introduce residual
maps, represented as complex quantities, that capture deviations of the local
polarized SED from the mean complex SED averaged over the sky mask. We make
simple predictions that relate the values of the statistical correlation and
covariances between the residual maps to the physical properties of the
emitting aligned grains. The validation or falsification of these predictions
provide valuable information on the nature of the dust signal. We confront our
predictions with Planck data over a 97% mask excluding the inner Galactic
plane. Despite its simplicity, our model captures a significant part of the
statistical properties of the data. The spectral dependence of the covariances
between residual maps is, for the Sroll2 version of the data, compatible with a
dust model assuming only temperature variations rather than spectral index
variations, while it is incompatible with either of them for the PR4 Planck
official release. Our methodology can be used to analyze future high precision
polarization data and build more accurate dust models to be used by the CMB

objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit
unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like
SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical
stellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet.
Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting
direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we
present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released,
publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models
spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities,
temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that
these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which
constitutes the majority of their lives ($\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling
relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the
bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of
the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem
with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every
supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of
our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are
broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These
results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of
supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18445v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of Repeating Transitions in 25 Changing-look Active Galactic

simulations of galaxy formation, yet its implementation has to rely on subgrid
models due to limited resolution. We present a novel subgrid jet-launching
method for galaxy formation simulations and implement it in three
hydrodynamical codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code SWIFT, the
moving-mesh code AREPO, and the Eulerian grid code PLUTO. To isolate the impact
of hydrodynamical solvers on jet evolution, we compare idealised jets and their
remnants in uniform and stratified media across resolutions and jet parameters.
In uniform media, all jets drive bow shocks, inflate hot lobes, exhibit
backflows, and evolve self-similarly. For the parameters explored, SWIFT lobes
are shorter, wider, and hotter; AREPO lobes are longer, thinner, and cooler;
while PLUTO lobes display complex flows with intermediate characteristics. In
stratified media, jets deviate from self-similar evolution, inflating longer
and thinner lobes due to lower external ram pressure. After switch-off, SWIFT
jets evolve into smooth cylindrical bubbles, AREPO jets produce long
filamentary remnants, and PLUTO jets yield intermediate-length remnants with
varying degrees of mixing. Despite such differences, all jets and remnants have
a similar impact on the ambient medium. We conclude that variations in lobe
properties between codes emerge even for identical subgrid prescriptions, since
the coupling of jet feedback to resolvable scales and the effective resolution
depend on the hydrodynamical method. In structure formation simulations, these
solver differences are likely subdominant to uncertainties in subgrid modelling
and calibration, while averaging over galaxy populations may lessen their
impact.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18006v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation Of Sub-Structure In Luminous Submillimeter galaxies (FOSSILS):

($\sim0.05$'') resolution by James Webb Space telescope (JWST) and Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Despite similarities
in their observed far-infrared properties (flux density, infrared luminosity,
and effective radius), the three SMGs exhibit heterogeneous morphologies both
across wavelengths and among the sources themselves. While two of them (AzTEC-4
and AzTEC-8) show a disk-like structure in optical continuum, AzTEC-1 is
dominated by highly concentrated component with the S\'{e}rsic index of
$n=5.4$, where its far-infrared continuum emission is clumpy and less
concentrated. AzTEC-4, which is confirmed to be at $z=4.198$, shows a two-arm
spiral of dust, but not in the stellar distribution. These three SMGs exemplify
that multiple physical mechanisms exist in triggering starbursts in luminous
SMGs at high redshift: secular instability in gas disks (AzTEC-4) in addition
to possible minor mergers (AzTEC-8), and a combination of the efficient gas
supply to the central core induced by a gas-rich major merger and the
reformation of cold gas disk (AzTEC-1).</p></br></body>
