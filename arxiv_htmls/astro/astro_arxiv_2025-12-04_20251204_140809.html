Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04080v1" target="_blank"><h2>The effect of baryons on the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG simulation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sergio Contreras, Raul E.

Although modern mocks can reproduce galaxy clustering to some extent, the absence of baryons affects the spatial and kinematic distributions of galaxies in ways that remain insufficiently quantified. We compare the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG hydrodynamic simulation with those in its dark-matter-only counterpart, assessing how baryonic effects influence galaxy clustering and contrasting them with the impact of galaxy selection, i.e. the dependence of clustering on sample definition. Using merger trees from both runs, we track satellite subhaloes until they become centrals, allowing us to match systems even when their z=0 positions differ. We then compute positional and velocity offsets as functions of halo mass and distance from the halo centre, and use these to construct a subhalo catalogue from the dark-matter-only simulation that reproduces the galaxy distribution in the hydrodynamic run. Satellites in the hydrodynamic simulation lie 3-4% closer to halo centres than in the dark-matter-only case, with an offset that is nearly constant with halo mass and increases toward smaller radii. Satellite velocities are also systematically higher in the dark-matter-only run. At scales of 0.1 Mpc/h, these spatial and kinematic differences produce 10-20% variations in clustering amplitude -corresponding to 1-3$σ$ assuming DESI-like errors- though the impact decreases at larger scales. These baryonic effects are relevant for cosmological and lensing analyses and should be accounted for when building high-fidelity mocks. However, they remain smaller than the differences introduced by galaxy selection, which thus represents the dominant source of uncertainty when constructing mocks based on observable quantities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04061v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multimessenger Constraints on Supermassive Dark Stars and Their Black Hole Remnants</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marco Manno, Thomas Schwemberger, Volodymyr Takhistov<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 38 pages, 18 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (abstract), AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dark matter (DM) annihilation can power the first generation of stars as long lived dark stars (DSs) that grow to supermassive scales $M_{\rm DS}\gtrsim 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and eventually collapse into heavy black holes that could seed the supermassive black holes observed at high redshifts. We compute the diffuse electromagnetic emission from a cosmological population of such supermassive DSs and their black hole remnants, tracking the entire DS history and including thermal surface radiation, DM annihilation in adiabatically contracted halos as well as late-time emission from DM overdensity spikes around the resulting black holes. After accounting for photon attenuation, we find that DS related contributions can exceed the Fermi-LAT extragalactic $γ$-ray background for thermal relic annihilation cross-sections and DM masses below $\sim 1$ TeV. Our results constitute the first population integrated diffuse multimessenger constraints on supermassive DSs as progenitors of early black holes and demonstrate that diffuse photon and neutrino backgrounds offer a powerful and complementary avenue for probing the role of DM in the formation of the earliest massive structures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04060v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Captures Growth of Aromatic Hydrocarbon Dust Particles in the Extremely Metal-poor Galaxy Sextans A</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elizabeth J.

In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $μ$m PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A. The compact clumps of PAH emission are likely active sites of in-situ PAH growth within a dense, well-shielded phase of the interstellar medium. Our results show that PAHs can form and survive in extremely metal-poor environments common early in the evolution of the Universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04043v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Nature of Nitrogen Enhanced High Redshift Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Peixin Zhu, James Trussler, Lisa J.

The strong N III] and N IV] features imply nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) as high as $-0.8 \lesssim \log(\mathrm{N/O}) \lesssim 0.4$ in these low-metallicity galaxies ($12+\log(\mathrm{O/H}) \lesssim 8.2$), compared to the local value of $\log(\mathrm{N/O})\approx-1.5$. If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H II region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure, simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H II model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact ($\lesssim0.1\,$dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width (EW)-based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance is varying. All nitrogen-enhanced galaxies have moderate to high gas pressure ($7.0\leq\log (P/k)\leq9.8$) and high ionization parameter ($\log(U)\gtrsim-2.0$), indicating a dense and compact environment. We suggest that super star clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars and massive stars are the most likely contributors to the elevated nitrogen abundance in these galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03999v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Nuclear Star Cluster of M 74: a fossil record of the very early stages of a star-forming galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Francesca Pinna, Nils Hoyer, Jairo Méndez Abreu, Adriana de Lorenzo Cáceres Rodriguez, Nadine Neumayer, Médéric Boquien, Salvador Cardona Barrero, Daniel A.

Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03965v1" target="_blank"><h2>Separating halo and disk stars in galaxies with Fuzzy Set Theory</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Amit Mondal, Biswajit Pandey<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, 1 table, 2 figures, comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Disk and halo stars are generally classified using several conventional methods, such as the Toomre diagram, sharp cuts in metallicity ([Fe/H]), vertical distance ($\left|Z\right|$) from the Galactic plane, or thresholds on the orbital circularity parameter ($ε$). However, all these methods rely on hard selection cuts, which either contaminate samples when relaxed or exclude genuine members when applied too strictly, leading to uncertain and biased classifications. We develop a flexible and reliable approach to classify disk and halo stars in galaxies by applying fuzzy set theory, which can overcome the limitations of traditional hard-cut selection methods. As a case study, we analyze one of the Milky Way/M31-like galaxies in the TNG50 catalogue. We consider multiple stellar properties as fuzzy variables and characterize their variations between disk and halo stars to construct the respective membership functions. These functions are then combined to assign each star a membership degree corresponding to its galactic component. Our fuzzy set approach provides a more realistic distinction between the disk and the halo stars. This method effectively reduces contamination and recovers genuine members that are often excluded by rigid selection criteria. The fuzzy set theory framework offers a robust alternative to conventional hard-cut methods, enabling more accurate and physically meaningful separation of stellar populations in galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03888v1" target="_blank"><h2>The anisotropy and magnetic field structure of neutron stars through gravitational wave</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhao-Wei Du, Xi-Long Fan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages,2 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate how gravitational wave (GW) observations can probe the internal physics of neutron stars by extending the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff framework to include pressure anisotropy and internal magnetic fields. Two representative magnetic field configurations, radial orientation dominated (RO) and transverse orientation dominated (TO), are implemented with strength and decay prescriptions. We found that both anisotropy and magnetic fields increase the maximum supported mass and modify the tidal deformability $Λ$, thereby imprinting measurable signatures on GW signals. For the equal mass binary ($1.2M_\odot$-$1.2M_\odot$), anisotropy neutron star with RO magnetic field yield more compact stars and a larger shift in $Λ$, allowing discrimination at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as low as $\sim18$ using the O4 power spectra density. TO fields produce weaker effects and require substantially higher SNRs for detection. In conclusion, we conclude that gravitational waves are capable of probing the internal structure of neutron stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03867v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Cosmological Dipole in Tilted Anisotropic Universes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alicia Martín, Constantinos Skordis, Deaglan J.

By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (< 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 60 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03824v1" target="_blank"><h2>The impact of our peculiar motion on primordial non-Gaussianity measurements using the LIGER4GAL framework</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bartolomeo Bottazzi Baldi, Mohamed Yousry Elkhashab, Daniele Bertacca, Cristiano Porciani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Current and forthcoming galaxy surveys will map the observable Universe with unprecedented depth, sky coverage, and precision. These maps are affected by relativistic redshift-space distortions (RSDs), which become increasingly relevant on ultra-large scales. Accurate modelling of these relativistic RSDs is essential to avoid systematic biases in key cosmological measurements, such as primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). To address this, we introduce an updated implementation of the LIGER method, LIGER4GAL, which incorporates all linear-order relativistic RSDs directly at the tracer level of high-resolution N-body simulations. We demonstrate that LIGER4GAL improves upon previous iterations of the LIGER method by reproducing the expected non-linear clustering while maintaining accuracy for relativistic RSDs on large scales. We use the updated code to generate a DESI-like sample of luminous red galaxies from the Huge MultiDark Planck simulation. By measuring the power spectrum multipoles of this sample with and without the imprint of relativistic RSDs, we assess the impact of relativistic effects on measurements of the local PNG signal ($f_\mathrm{nl}$). We find that the omission of the''finger-of-the-observer'' (sourced by the peculiar velocity of the observer) effect in the power spectrum modelling can bias measurements of $f_{\rm nl}$ by more than $1$ ($0.25$) $ σ_{f_{\rm nl}}$ in 40% (80%) of the possible realizations of the universe if scales down to $k_\mathrm{min} = 0.0015\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ are included.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03801v1" target="_blank"><h2>A strategy for optimal material identification in solar dark photon absorption</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Theresa M.

Our strategy builds on a material-independent upper limit on the absorption rate, which we derive from Kramers-Kronig relations applied separately to the longitudinal and transverse dark photon modes. We show how the optimal material properties depend on the dark photon mass relative to the detector's plasma frequency, identifying the conditions under which a detector can saturate the theoretical upper limit. We then assess the performance of commonly used detector materials in light of these criteria and comment on the prospects of metamaterials featuring tunable plasma frequencies.

In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $ζ$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $ζ$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $ζ$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03702v1" target="_blank"><h2>Trapped fireshell (halo) of photons and pairs around black-hole horizon: source for ultra-high-energy particles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> She-Sheng Xue<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 27 pages and 15 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the Compton-rocket effect of multi-photon interacting with electrons in an opaque fireball (or fire spot) of photons and $e^-e^+$ pairs at temperature $T_γ\gg m_e$.

Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03591v1" target="_blank"><h2>Statistical and Temporal Analysis of Multi-component Burst-clusters from the Repeating FRB 20190520B</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jia-heng Zhang, Chen-Hui Niu, Yu-hao Zhu, Di Li, Wei-yang Wang, Yi Feng, Xin-ming Li, Jia-rui Niu, Pei Wang, Yun-wei Yu, Yong-kun Zhang, Xiao-ping Zheng<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients that probe extreme astrophysical environments. Many FRBs exhibit multi-component structures, which encode information about their emission mechanisms or progenitor systems and thus provide important clues to their origins. In this work, we systematically analyze the burst morphology of FRB 20190520B and compare component distributions across four active FRBs observed with FAST: FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20240114A. We find that multi-component burst-clusters show spectral properties similar to single-peak bursts, and no periodicity is detected in their temporal behavior. The component-count distributions follow a power law, revealing scale-free behavior consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) processes. Multi-component clusters account for 12-30% of all detected bursts, regardless of source activity, providing new insights into burst-to-burst variability and the physical processes driving FRB emission.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03533v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving the Multiple Component Outflows in PG 1211+143: I.

The primary objective is to characterize the Fe-K absorption features due to Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO) in this Eddington-luminosity source. Observations were conducted with XRISM's Resolve and Xtend instruments, complemented by simultaneous data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. A historically bright phase was captured. The Resolve spectra clearly reveal a prominent P Cygni profile and resolves the Fe-K absorption into six distinct velocity components, ranging from $v = -0.074c$ to $-0.405c$. A similar superposition of multiple UFOs has been reported in PDS~456, suggesting that such a ``UFO forest'' structure may be a common feature of near Eddington-luminosity sources. Some UFO components exhibit narrow line widths of approximately $σ\sim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which may indicate that the outflows have reached their terminal velocities, thereby resulting in a smaller velocity shear. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be $\dot{M}_\mathrm{out} \sim 1~M_{\odot}~\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is of the order of the Eddington accretion rate. This suggests a physically plausible scenario where the outflow is a significant channel for mass ejection.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03484v1" target="_blank"><h2>Motion of a charged test particle around a static black hole in a monopole magnetic field</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ken-ichi Nakao, Yota Endo, Hideki Ishihara, Kenta Matsuo, Kensuke Sueto, Koudai Ueda, Hirotaka Yoshino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the motion of a charged test particle in the spacetime with a spherically symmetric black hole which is immersed in a monopole magnetic field. We show that the radial motion of the charged test particle is governed by completely the same equation as that in the case of no magnetic field. This result implies that the black hole will acquire the electric charge if it is surrounded by the collisionless plasma composed of protons and electrons which obey the Maxwell velocity distribution. The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light.

Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $α_\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $α_\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $α_\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03433v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Deep Chandra X-ray Survey of a Luminous Quasar Sample at $z\sim$ 7</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiangyu Jin, Feige Wang, Jinyi Yang, Xiaohui Fan, Fuyan Bian, Jiang-Tao Li, Weizhe Liu, Yichen Liu, Jianwei Lyu, Maria Pudoka, Wei Leong Tee, Yunjing Wu, Haowen Zhang, Yongda Zhu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present new Chandra observations of seven luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.

Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $α_{\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $α_{\rm OX}-L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $α_{\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $Γ$ is $2.41\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03415v1" target="_blank"><h2>Building a Radio AGN Sample from Cosmic Morning -- The Radio High-Redshift Quasar Catalog (RHzQCat): I.

Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z>6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03411v1" target="_blank"><h2>Conformal Holographic Dark Energy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mario A.

These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03385v1" target="_blank"><h2>Voyager 1 Data Reveals Signatures of the Local Gas and Cosmic-Ray Source Distributions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Troy A.

Comparing with recent Voyager 1 data taken in the local ISM, we show that for a realistic interstellar gas distribution, the nearest source of the low energy CR particles observed nearby the Solar system is constrained to be within the range ~150-200 pc distant. We find that the modelling supports the conclusion of Cummings et al. (2025) that there is a significant fraction of primary Boron in its observed spectrum at low energies. Our study shows that detailed modelling of the immediate Galactic environment is required to robustly infer Galactic CR propagation parameters from local measurements, and that accounting for nearby ISM structure can alleviate tensions between direct CR data and global propagation models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03357v1" target="_blank"><h2>BEC vortices as an observational signature of ultra-light bosonic dark matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rongzi Zhou, Dylan M.

Using numerical solution of the GPP equation, we demonstrate that a lattice of vortices ,underdensity columns that carry angular momentum, naturally forms in a ULDM halo under conditions similar to those of the Milky Way. Furthermore, we study the gravitational lensing by these vortices as a possible observational signature of BEC-ULDM.

In particular, we focus on the fraction of unstable dark matter, $α_{\mathrm{dcdm}}$ respect to the ordinary CDM component, and the decay rate, $Γ_{\mathrm{dcdm}}$ as the key parameters of the model. Fiducial values are derived from a MontePython MCMC analysis. The derivatives of the growth-related observable, $fσ_8(z)$ with respect to the parameters are numerically around the fiducial model. For the Fisher analysis, we employ mock data designed for upcoming surveys, particularly Euclid and BOSS, where RSD measurements yield constraints on $fσ_8.$ Our results show that when both stable and unstable components are allowed, constrains on the DCDM lifetime remain weak, with $τ_{\mathrm{dcdm}}>1.18$ Gyr. In the limiting case of fully unstable dark matter ($α_{\mathrm{dcdm}}=1$), the uncertainty improves to $τ_{\mathrm{dcdm}}>235.89$ Gyr. Our findings highlight the potential of RSD probes in testing and complementing decaying dark matter scenarios.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03332v1" target="_blank"><h2>A three-dimensional model for the reversal in the local large-scale interstellar magnetic field</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rebecca A.

DRAGONS is a new full polarization survey of the Northern sky from 350 to 1030 MHz covering declinations -20° < $δ$ < 90° and a component of GMIMS. The first moment of the Faraday depth spectra produced from DRAGONS above 500 MHz reveals large-angular-scale Faraday depth structures with signs that alternate only once in the Southern Galactic hemisphere and twice in the Northern hemisphere, patterns shared by other Faraday rotation datasets. DRAGONS is the first survey to achieve high Faraday depth resolution while maintaining sensitivity to broad Faraday depth structures, enabling the first use of Galactic longitude-Faraday depth plots. These plots reveal Faraday-complex structures across the sky, indicating a slab-like scenario in which emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. This complexity is overlaid on the same large-scale Faraday depth patterns that appear in the first moment map. We model these patterns as a magnetic reversal slicing through the disk on a diagonal and passing above the Sun in Galactic coordinates. We describe this reversal as a plane with a normal vector parallel to the line directed along ($\ell$, b) = (168.5°, -60°) and estimate its distance to be between 0.25 and 0.55 kpc.

One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\pm$8 $μ$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\pm$3 $μ$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03329v1" target="_blank"><h2>Push-broom Mapping of Galaxies and Supernova Remnants with the SPRITE CubeSat</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elena Carlson, Brian Fleming, Yi Hang Valerie Wong, Briana Indahl, Dmitry Vorobiev, Maitland Bowen, Donal O'Sullivan, Kevin France, Anne Jaskot, Jason Tumlinson, Sanchayeeta Borthakur, Michael Rutkowski, Stephan McCandliss, Ravi Sankrit, John M.

The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03281v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Comprehensive JWST/NIRSpec Census of Broad-Line Active Galactic Nuclei: Faint, Tiny, but Highly Accreting Sources in the Remote Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Caroline Baccus, Xinfeng Xu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, 19 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), high redshift (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract), quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a sample of 252 broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs), incorporating 171 newly identified sources, spanning a redshift interval from $z$ = 0.8 to 7.2. We have analyzed spectroscopic data from the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope, using the G140H, G140M, G235H, G235M, G395H, and G395M gratings to survey N $\sim$ 80,000 galaxies for BLAGNs. Through emission-line fitting, using a sum of Gaussian models for {H$α$}, {H$β$}, [N II] $λ\lambda6548, 6584$, and [O III] $ λ\lambda4959, 5007$, we separate AGN broad-line components from narrow-line emission. We find the detection rate of BLAGNs to be relatively consistent across our redshift range. Compared to typical low-$z$ AGNs ($z$ $\lesssim$ 1), the high-$z$ BLAGNs are systematically fainter and less massive, yet they accrete more efficiently, with most showing Eddington ratios between 0.1 and 1.0. This confirms the rapid black hole growth during the early cosmic epochs. The detection of faint, low-mass BLAGNs at high redshift also helps bridge the observational gap between local supermassive black holes and remote luminous quasars, providing a more complete view of black hole-galaxy coevolution across cosmic time.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03239v1" target="_blank"><h2>(Re)solving the complex multi-scale morphology and V-shaped SED of a newly discovered strongly-lensed Little Red Dot in Abell 383</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Josephine F.

The source shows the characteristic "V-shaped" SED and pronounced Balmer break that define the LRD population. Owing to its large magnifications, $μ\sim11$ for image S1 and $μ\sim7$ for S2, the system is exceptionally bright and highly stretched, providing a rare, spatially resolved view of an LRD. The images reveal a complex morphology with a compact red dot, a spatially offset blue dot, and faint emission bridging and surrounding the two. After correcting for lensing, we find that both dots are extremely small but resolved, with rest-frame UV sizes of $\sim 20$ pc (red) and $\sim60$ pc (blue). These compact dots are embedded in a more extended, line-dominated cloud traced most clearly in F356W ([OIII]+H$β$), which reaches scales of order $\sim$1 kpc. SED decomposition shows that the blue component has a flat UV continuum consistent with a young stellar population, whereas the red component has a steep red SED that can be interpreted as either an evolved stellar population with high stellar mass ($\log M_\star/M_\odot>10$) or a reddened AGN. If this object is representative of the LRD population, our results imply that the V-shaped SEDs of LRDs do not arise from individual compact sources but instead from the superposition of two physically distinct components.

The primary purpose of this paper is to perform the calibration of the zero-point for the DESI Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, which allows us to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. This sample has a lower statistical uncertainty than any previously used to measure $H_0$, and we investigate the systematic uncertainties in absolute calibration that could limit the accuracy of that measurement. We improve upon the DESI Early Data Release Fundamental Plane $H_0$ measurement by a) using a group catalog to increase the number of calibrator galaxies and b) investigating alternative calibrators in the nearby universe. Our baseline measurement calibrates to the SH0ES/Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, and finds $H_0=73.7\pm 0.06\;(\text{stat.})\pm 1.1\;(\text{syst.})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Calibrating to surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances yields a similar $H_0$. We explore measurements using other calibrators, but these are currently less precise since the overlap with DESI peculiar velocity tracers is much smaller. In future data releases with an even larger peculiar velocity sample, we plan to calibrate directly to Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch, which will enable the uncertainty to decrease towards a percent-level measurement of $H_0$. This will provide an alternative to supernovae as the Hubble flow sample for $H_0$ measurements.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03231v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: Growth Rate Measurements from the Galaxy Power Spectrum</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

A powerful means of unlocking this knowledge lies in measuring the auto-power spectrum and/or the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields, followed by the estimation of cosmological parameters based on these spectrum measurements. In this study, we generalize the cross-power spectrum model to accommodate scenarios where the density and momentum fields are derived from distinct galaxy surveys. The growth rate of the large-scale structures of the Universe, commonly represented as $fσ_8$, is extracted by jointly fitting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the auto-density power spectrum, the monopole of the auto-momentum power spectrum, and the dipole of the cross-power spectrum. Our estimators, theoretical models and parameter-fitting framework have been tested using mocks, confirming their robustness and accuracy in retrieving the fiducial growth rate from simulation. These techniques are then applied to analyze the power spectrum of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey and Peculiar Velocity Survey, and the fit result of the growth rate is $fσ_8=0.440^{+0.080}_{-0.096}$ at effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.07$. By synthesizing the fitting outcomes from correlation functions, maximum likelihood estimation and power spectrum, yields a consensus value of $fσ_8(z_{\rm eff}=0.07) = 0.450 ^{+0.055}_{-0.055}$, and correspondingly we obtain $γ=0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, $Ω_\mathrm{m}=0.301^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ and $σ_8=0.834^{+0.032}_{-0.032}$. The measured $fσ_8$ and $γ$ are consistent with the prediction of the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter Model and General Relativity.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03230v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: growth rate measurements from galaxy and momentum correlation functions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

Our mock catalogs reproduce the Bright Galaxy Survey number density and clustering at low redshift $(z<0.1)$ and the DESI PV samples of Fundamental plane and Tully-Fisher distances, from which we derive peculiar velocities. We carefully match mock and data properties and we mimic measurements of distance indicators and peculiar velocities, which follow the same statistical properties as real data. Mock samples of type-Ia supernovae also complement the other two distance indicators. Our 675 available mock realizations were used consistently by our three different methodologies described in our companion papers that measure the growth rate of structure $fσ_8$ with DESI PV DR1. Those mocks allow us to perform precise tests of clustering models and uncertainty estimation to an unprecedented level of accuracy, and compute correlations between methodologies. The consensus value for the DESI DR1 PV growth rate measurement is $fσ_8 = 0.450 \pm 0.055$.

While the latest TDCOSMO results relied mainly on quadruply lensed quasars, doubly lensed systems are far more common and offer precise time delays, potentially enlarging the usable sample by a factor of five and enabling percent-level constraints on H_0. We present the first TDCOSMO analysis of a doubly imaged source, HE1104-1805, including the measurement of the four necessary ingredients. First, by combining 17 years of data from the SMARTS, Euler and WFI telescopes, we measure a time delay of 176.3\pm 10.8 days. Second, using MUSE data, we extract stellar velocity dispersion measurements in three radial bins with up to 5% precision. Third, employing F160W HST imaging for lens modelling and marginalising over various modelling choices, we measure the Fermat potential difference between the images. Fourth, using wide-field imaging, we measure the convergence added by objects not included in the lens modelling. Hence, we measure the time delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the deflector, favouring a power-law mass model over a baryonic and dark matter composite model. The measurement was performed blindly and yielded H_0 = 64.2^{+5.8}_{-5.0} x $λ_{int} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, where λ_{int} is the internal mass sheet degeneracy parameter. This is in agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 milestone and its precision for λ_{int}=1 is comparable to that obtained with the best-observed quadruply lensed quasars (4-6%). This work is a stepping stone towards a precise measurement of H_0 using a large sample of doubly lensed quasars, supplementing the current sample. The next TDCOSMO milestone paper will include this system in its hierarchical analysis, constraining λ_{int} and H_0 jointly with multiple lenses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03169v1" target="_blank"><h2>Magnetic Field Amplification and Particle Acceleration in Weakly Magnetized Trans-relativistic Electron-ion Shocks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Taiki Jikei, Daniel Groselj, Lorenzo Sironi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 13 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(σ\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(σ\lesssim10^{-4})$. Bell-dominated shocks efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\max}\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell-dominated regime. On the other hand, Weibel-dominated shocks efficiently generate both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\mathrm{max}}\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03168v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Origins of the Bulk flow</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Richard Watkins, Hume A.

We decompose the observed motions into internal components, generated by mass fluctuations within 200Mpc/h, and external ones arising from structures beyond this volume. A weighted average technique is developed to test the model's self consistency while minimizing the impact of non Gaussian distance errors. The CF4 velocities show excellent agreement with the predicted internal field, yielding beta = 0.31 pm 0.01. We also determine that the value of the Hubble constant that should be used for calculating peculiar velocities from the CF4 to be H0 = 75.9 pm 0.1 km/s/ Mpc, consistent with CF4 calibrations. Using the minimum variance formalism, we further separate the bulk flow into its internal and external contributions and find that the observed large scale bulk flow is dominated by sources beyond 200Mpc/h. The amplitude of this externally driven flow increases monotonically with scale, consistent with the influence of a distant, massive overdensity. These findings reinforce the reliability of the CF4 velocity field while calling into question the assumption of a spatially uniform flow generated by external sources. Our results challenge the commonly made assumption that the flow in our local volume due to external mass concentrations can be modeled as being spatially uniform.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03155v1" target="_blank"><h2>From scalar clouds around evaporating black holes to boson star</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daniel Neves, João G.

This yields a novel mechanism for boson star formation and shows that, as previously conjectured, bosonic dark matter production by light primordial black holes may result in micro-boson stars with very large occupation numbers, greatly enhancing their potential detectability even for very weakly interacting dark matter particles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03154v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Ancient Descendant of the First Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jacqueline Antwi-Danso, Adam Muzzin, Luke Robbins, Yoshihisa Asada, Danilo Marchesini, Marcin Sawicki, Kartheik Iyer, Kate Whitaker, Joshua Speagle, Casey Papovich, Chris Willott, Maruša Bradač, Guillaume Desprez, Vladan Markov, Nicholas Martis, Gaël Noirot, Ghassan Sarrouh, Rahul Kannan, Roberto Abraham, Seiji Fujimoto, Katherine Myers<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages, 9 figures.

Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short ($\approx 40$ Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 ($z = 5.95 \pm 0.06$, $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 9.14 \pm 0.09$), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr ($z \gtrsim 14$), where it formed a $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 8.7^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\ M_{\odot}$ progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of $\approx 3$. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is $< 0.2\%$. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03152v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inferring black hole formation channels in GWTC-4.0 via parametric mass-spin correlations derived from first principles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Emanuele Berti, Francesco Crescimbeni, Gabriele Franciolini, Simone Mastrogiovanni, Paolo Pani, Grégoire Pierra<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the differences between several proposed formation scenarios for binary black holes (BBHs), including isolated stellar evolution, dynamical assembly in dense clusters and AGN disks, and primordial BHs. Our approach exploits the predicted spin features of each formation channel, and adopts parameterized models of the predicted correlations between the spin magnitudes (and orientations) and mass, inspired by first principles. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence. Finally, the mass-spin correlation predicted by the primordial scenario gives a poor fit to the data, and this scenario can only account for a subset of the observed events.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03150v1" target="_blank"><h2>Joint JWST-DECam Lensing Reveals That the Bullet Cluster Is a Minor Merger</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Boseong Young Cho, M.

Despite its status as the benchmark system for dark matter and merger studies, inferred mass ratios for the Bullet Cluster have spanned a wide range from $\sim$2:1 to $\gtrsim$10:1 over more than two decades. We revisit this tension through three key advances: (1) JWST's exceptional data quality enables us to resolve three distinct halos, (2) DECam's wide-field coverage beyond its virial radius eliminates the need for extrapolation, and (3) high-fidelity strong-lensing priors mitigate weak-lensing model bias. We obtain $M_{200c} = 15.11^{+2.48}_{-2.10} \times 10^{14}M_{\odot}$ for the main cluster and $1.49^{+0.32}_{-0.25} \times 10^{14}M_{\odot}$ for the subcluster, yielding a mass ratio of $10.14^{+3.22}_{-2.47}$, definitively classifying the Bullet Cluster as a minor merger. This result reconciles the long-standing tension in the mass ratio and provides updated initial parameters for future modeling of this iconic system.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03145v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the Origin of Gas-stripping of Galaxies in Group Environments</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jinsu Rhee, Christophe Pichon, Yohan Dubois, Sukyoung K.

Many satellite galaxies preserve substantial gas reservoirs, yet show signs of outer gas stripping, reminiscent of jellyfish galaxies in clusters. In contrast, low-mass satellites ($<10^8 \, M_{\odot}$) are largely gas-deficient, and some of them undergo gas removal within their host group by external pressure triggered by either galaxy interactions or ram pressure exerted by the hot intragroup medium. Complete gas removal in these satellite galaxies occurs when the external hydrodynamic pressure exceeds the gravitational restoring force, typically due to stochastic events such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or nearby galactic outflows. The emergence of a characteristic stellar mass of $10^8 \, M_{\odot}$ which determines the efficiency of gas removal in groups, likely reflects the differing scaling relations of external pressure with halo mass and gravitational restoring force with stellar mass. While tidal interactions can be a significant cause of gas loss in satellite galaxies, those severe enough to affect the gas content in the central regions typically lead to the complete disruption of the galaxy. Consequently, gas loss driven by tidal interactions may be underestimated in the studies focusing solely on surviving galaxies. Group environments, where environmental effects are weaker and satellite galaxies tend to have lower restoring forces due to their low masses, exhibit complex manifestations of gas loss that are not seen in more massive environments such as clusters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03143v1" target="_blank"><h2>Infrared emission from $z \sim 6.5$ quasar host galaxies: a direct estimate of dust physical properties</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

Nevertheless, their infrared spectral energy distribution remains at the present time poorly constrained, due to the limited photometric coverage probing the far-infrared wavelength range where the dust modified black-body is expected to peak ($\sim80$ $\mathrm{μm}$). Here we present a study of the high-frequency dust emission via a dedicated ALMA Band 8 ($\sim$400 GHz) campaign targeting 11 quasar host galaxies at $6<z<7$. Combined with archival observations in other ALMA bands, this program enables a detailed characterization of their infrared emission, allowing for the derivation of dust masses ($M_{d}$), dust emissivity indexes ($β$), dust temperatures ($T_{d}$), infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}$), and associated star formation rates (SFRs). Our analysis confirms that dust temperature is on average higher in this sample (34-65 K) if compared to local main-sequence galaxies' values, and that this finding can be linked to the increased star formation efficiency we derive in our work, as also suggested by the [CII]$_{158μm}$ deficit. Most remarkably, we note that the average value of $T_d$ of this sample doesn't differ from the one that is observed in luminous, ultra-luminous and hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at different redshifts that show no signs of hosting a quasar. Finally, our findings suggest that the presence of a bright AGN does not significantly bias the derived infrared properties, although further high-frequency, high-spatial resolution observations might reveal more subtle impacts on sub-kiloparsec scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03129v1" target="_blank"><h2>Taming the Tarantula: How Stellar Wind Feedback Shapes Gas and Dust in 30 Doradus</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jennifer A.

In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. H$α$ and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the H$α$ shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the H$α$ shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and H$α$ emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03130v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Critical Evaluation of the Physical Nature of the Little Red Dots</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C.

Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03132v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Density Profiles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alex M.

In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03134v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Mass-Metallicity Relation and its Observational Effects at z~3-6</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zach Lewis, Michael V.

However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03038v1" target="_blank"><h2>A new constraint on the $y$-distortion with FIRAS: implications for feedback models in galaxy formation and cosmic shear measurements</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Giulio Fabbian, Federico Bianchini, Alina Sabyr, J.

We begin by clarifying under what conditions standard simplifications -- such as the coincident gauge or General Relativity (GR)-like connections -- inadvertently lead to GR behavior, even in non-trivial $f(\mathbb{Q})$ models. Building on previous work in black hole (BH) spacetimes, we adapt the formalism to NS and extend it to non-vacuum configurations. Focusing on two representative models, $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + α\mathbb{Q}^2$ and $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q}^β$, our analysis suggests that, under standard regularity assumptions, solutions with Maclaurin/Laurent-type series recover GR dynamics, pointing to more intricate structures as the likely seat of beyond-GR effects, and reflecting the constraints imposed by the connection's dynamics on the asymptotic behavior of genuinely beyond-GR solutions. We then formulate the problem as a boundary value problem (BVP) and highlight the numerical pathologies that may arise, together with possible strategies to prevent them. This work aims to provide a concrete framework for future numerical studies and outlines the theoretical consistency conditions required to construct physically meaningful beyond-GR NS solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03016v1" target="_blank"><h2>Topological Shell Structures in Neutron Stars: Effects on Equilibrium, Oscillations, and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Debojoti Kuzur, Kamal Krishna Nath<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 8 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the structural and dynamical consequences of introducing a distributional density profile inside a neutron star, representing a massless, topological shell located at an arbitrary radius.

We find strong, non-monotonic variations in the mode frequency relative to standard no-shell models. Using first-principles scaling relations, we estimate various gravitational wave observables such as the damping time, quality factor, luminosity and characteristic strain. These observables are then compared with the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

For the core of the halo, the dark matter fermions are degenerate, while for the halo we have considered two possibilities: the fermions have thermalized as a perfect fluidor they will follow a standard cold dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White profile. The core density profile is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and their properties are determined by the fermion mass, the central density and the interaction strength. The mass of the fermion and the strength of the fermion self-interaction is fixed by doing a $χ^2$ analysis to fit that fit the rotational curves of Low Surface Brightness galaxies. It was found that the fermion mass should be in the range $38.73~\rm{eV}< m_{f} < 42.11~\rm{eV}$ and the interparticle strength in the range $269.69 < y <348.48$ at $68$ C.L. in order to reproduce the rotational curves adequately, in the case when the halo is modeled as a thermalized ideal gas. Similar values are obtained if the halo is modeled following a Navarro-Frenk-White case, namely $41.54 ~\rm{eV} < m_{f} <49.87 ~\rm{eV}$ and $5606.06< y < 17484.84$. Once fixed the values of the mass of the fermion $m_f$ and the interaction strength $y$, we tested the core-halo model with data from the Milky Way and the SPARC database. We have found good agreement between the data and the core-halo models, varying only one free parameter: the central density. Thus a single fermion can fit hundreds of galaxies. Nevertheless, the dark matter halo surface density relation or the halo total mass and radius depend strongly on the model for the halo.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02997v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIRI spectrophotometry of GN-z11: Detection and nature of an optical red continuum component</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

We report significant detections (14$σ$) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2$σ$) in F1000W. Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_ν$, up to 0.5$μ$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$β$ and H$α$ emission lines. The continuum at rest-frame 0.66$μ$m shows a 36$\pm$3% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91$\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$μ$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$μ$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$μ$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$μ$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02992v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Composite Spectrum of QSO Absorption Line Systems in DESI DR2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lucas Napolitano, Adam D.

In this composite spectrum we identify more than 70 absorption lines, and observe oxygen and hydrogen emission features at a higher signal-to-noise ratio than in any previous study. As the light from a distant quasar travels towards an observer, it may interact with the circumgalactic medium environment of an intervening galaxy, forming absorption lines. In order to maximize the signal of these absorption lines, we have selected a sample of 238,838 quasar spectra from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), each identified to have absorption lines resulting from such an interaction. By stacking these spectra in the restframe of the absorption, and calculating a median composite spectrum, we are able to isolate and enhance these absorption lines. We provide a full atlas of all detected absorption and emission lines as well as their fit centroids and equivalent width values. This atlas should aid in future studies investigating the compositions and physical conditions of these absorbers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02969v1" target="_blank"><h2>Singular $α$-attractors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-th, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 9 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> $α$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $α$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $α$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $α$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02954v1" target="_blank"><h2>The suppression of the matter power spectrum: strong feedback from X-ray gas mass fractions, kSZ effect profiles, and galaxy-galaxy lensing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jared Siegel, Leah Bigwood, Alexandra Amon, Jamie McCullough, Masaya Yamamoto, Ian G.

We constrain the impact of baryon feedback on the matter power spectrum by jointly analysing X-ray gas mass fractions from the eROSITA and HSC-XXL samples and SDSS/DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles; the samples are characterised with galaxy-galaxy lensing and together span group and cluster masses at $0<z<1$. Using the baryonification framework, our joint eROSITA and kSZ model gives precise constraints on the suppression of the matter power spectrum: $10 \pm 2\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS. The HSC-XXL gas mass fractions, which the fiducial simulations were calibrated to reproduce, prefer more moderate power suppression than the kSZ and eROSITA data: $5 \pm 4\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. With a simulated LSST Year 1 weak lensing analysis, we demonstrate a framework for next-generation surveys: calibrating feedback models with multi-wavelength gas observables to recover the small-scale statistical power of cosmic shear.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02923v1" target="_blank"><h2>Distinguishing ram pressure from gravitational interactions: Applying the Size-Shape Difference method to real galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Augusto E.

While RPS affects recently formed stars by displacing the gas disk from which they form, gravitational interactions perturb stars of all ages rather similarly. We present the first observational test of the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure, a novel approach validated for simulated galaxies, that quantifies morphological differences between young and intermediate-age stellar populations to distinguish RPS from gravitationally interacting galaxies. We analyze 67 galaxies from the GASP survey using spatially-resolved star formation histories derived using SINOPSIS. In our fiducial model, we compare stellar populations in two age bins (t < 20 Myr and 20 Myr <= t < 570 Myr) to calculate SSD values. The sample includes confirmed RPS cases with different stripping intensities, as well as undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies. We find that extreme cases of RPS show SSD values ~3.5x higher than undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies (56(+24/-15) as compared to 16(+6/-2) and 16(+6/-3), respectively), confirming simulation predictions. This enhancement reflects RPS-induced asymmetries: youngest stars are compressed along the leading edge and/or displaced into the extended tails of cold gas, while older populations remain undisturbed. In contrast, gravitational interactions perturb all stars uniformly, producing lower SSD values. SSD robustly distinguishes strong RPS cases, even adopting different age bins. This holds even without correcting for disk inclination, or when single-band imaging are used to trace stellar distributions. This makes SSD a promising tool to select RPS candidates for spectroscopic follow-up in upcoming surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02880v1" target="_blank"><h2>Insights into Extragalactic Background Light constraints with MAGIC archival data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results. This will be especially important for upcoming with new VHE facilities, where systematic uncertainties are expected to play a more significant role compared to statistical ones.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02857v1" target="_blank"><h2>On Constraining the Proposed Hierarchical Triple Scenario for an Eccentric Milli-Second Pulsar Binary PSR J1618-3921</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Adya Shukla, A.

We investigate observational implications of the proposed HT scenario for PSR J1618-3921 and our ability to constrain the scenario. We model the MSP-Helium White Dwarf binary to be a part of bound point-mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the quadrupolar interactions between the inner and outer binaries, along with dominant order general relativistic contributions to the periastron precession of the inner binary. If the proposed HT system is indeed undergoing Kozai oscillations at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity ($e$) would be expected to decrease, while the rate of periastron advance ($\dotω$) would correspondingly increase, for plausible ranges of the HT parameters. Furthermore, the fractional variations in $e$ are anticipated to be at the level of a few parts in $10^{5}$-a magnitude that is substantially larger than the current measurement precision of $e$. We find that, for this eccentric MSP binary, the HT configurations that minimize the temporal evolution of orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are mutually incompatible. This indicates that the continued high-precision timing of PSR J1618-3921-when analyzed within the framework introduced here-should place stringent limits on the presence and properties of a potential third body in the system.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02839v1" target="_blank"><h2>VHE FSRQs with Fermi-LAT: VHE and even brighter states in high-z FSRQs due to an HBL-like component?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Megha, Pankaj Kushwaha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Very high-energy (VHE) detected flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are relatively few despite being the most persistent bright MeV-GeV sources. Focusing on VHE emission, we investigated the spectral and temporal properties of VHE-detected FSRQs using 14-year Fermi-LAT data. All are highly variable (flux-amplitude$>$100) with VHE detection associated with brighter flux states and relatively harder spectra. Above a flux limit, flux anti-correlates with spectral index, exhibiting a bluer-when-brighter trend. The low-flux state spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all resembles a power-law, while high-flux and VHE-associated states resemble a log-parabola, accompanied by an almost nil (PKS0736+017, PKS1510-089) to marginal (4C+21.35, 3C279) to significant (B21420+32, TON0599, PKS1441+25, S30218+35, PKS0346-27, OP313) MeV-GeV peak-upshift -- more prominent in high-redshift sources. For no/marginal peak-upshift, the VHE emission is consistent with external Comptonization of infrared photons (EC-IR) driven primarily by a power-law continuation of the particle spectrum to higher energies. For those with a significant MeV-GeV peak-upshift, PKS0346-27 and OP313 shows peak-upshift in the synchrotron spectrum, and thus VHE is EC-IR origin, while for others without synchrotron-peak upshift, we attribute the VHE to an HBL-like component with a Compton-Dominance (CD) like FSRQs, with VHE driven primarily by particle spectrum continuation. In some, even high-state SEDs seem to require an HBL-like component. Thus, VHE activities in FSRQs mainly result from particle spectrum continuation, aided by spectral transition or a new HBL-like component with FSRQ-like CD. Such spectral changes naturally brighten the GeV-VHE flux, overcoming extragalactic background light absorption without requiring extraordinary brightening under the traditional EC-IR scenario than normally exhibited.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02836v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Quasar Survey: Quasar Properties from Data Release 10 to 12</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bing Lyu, Xue-Bing Wu, Jun-Jie Jin, Yuming Fu, Yuxuan Pang, Huimei Wang, Rui Zhu, Su Yao, Yan-Li Ai, Yan-xia Zhang, Hai-long Yuan, Zhi-ying Huo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 figures, 2 tables, accepted by ApJs<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), AGN (abstract), quasar (title, abstract), broad absorption line quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the quasar catalog from Data Releases 10 to 12 of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Quasar Survey, comprising quasars observed between September 2021 and June 2024. We robustly identified $11,346$ quasars, of which $5,386$ are newly discovered objects not present in the Million Quasars catalog. This release brings the total number of quasars identified by the 12-year LAMOST survey to $67,521$, of which $29,513$ are newly discovered. While the absolute flux calibration for LAMOST quasar spectra from Data Releases 6 to 9 was previously performed using the SDSS/PanSTARRS1 multi-band photometric data, the inherent variability of quasars can affect the flux accuracy. To address this limitation, we recalibrated the LAMOST spectra using (quasi-)simultaneous photometric data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has conducted high-cadence sky monitoring since March 2018. Based on the recalibrated single-epoch spectra, we estimated the emission line fluxes, continuum fluxes, and virial black hole masses. These improved spectra facilitate direct comparison with the spectra of common quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enabling searches for rare quasars, such as changing-look quasars exhibiting the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines and broad absorption line quasars. The combined dataset of photometry and multi-epoch spectra will enhance the detections of AGN-related transients, such as Bowen fluorescence flares and extreme variability quasars, thereby improving our understanding of quasar variability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02805v1" target="_blank"><h2>Direct observational evidence that higher-luminosity type 1 active galactic nuclei are most commonly triggered by galaxy mergers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yongmin Yoon, Yongjung Kim, Dohyeong Kim, Kyungwon Chun, Woowon Byun<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We examine the connection between galaxy mergers and the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using a sample of 614 type 1 AGNs at $z<0.07$, along with a control sample of inactive galaxies matched to the AGNs for comparison. We used tidal features, detected in deep images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, as direct evidence of recent mergers. We find that the fraction of type 1 AGN hosts with tidal features ($f_T$) is higher for AGNs with higher luminosities and (to a lesser extent) more massive black holes. Specifically, $f_T$ rapidly increases from $0.05\pm0.03$ to $0.75\pm0.13$ as the luminosity of the $[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]$ $λ$5007 emission line ($L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$), an indicator for bolometric AGN luminosity, increases in the range $10^{39.5}\lesssim L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}/(\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}) \lesssim10^{42.5}$. In addition, $f_T$ increases from $0.13\pm0.03$ to $0.43\pm0.09$ as black hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) increases in the range $10^{6.0}\lesssim M_\mathrm{BH}/M_{\odot}\lesssim10^{8.5}$. The fraction $f_T$ also increases with the Eddington ratio, although the trend is less significant compared to that with $L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and $M_\mathrm{BH}$. The excess of $f_T$, defined as the ratio of $f_T$ for AGNs to that of their matched inactive counterparts, exhibits similar trends, primarily increasing with $L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and weakly with $M_\mathrm{BH}$. Our results indicate that, in the local Universe, galaxy mergers are the predominant triggering mechanism for high-luminosity AGNs, whereas they play a lesser role in triggering lower-luminosity AGNs. Additionally, strong events, such as galaxy mergers, may be more necessary to activate massive black holes in more massive galaxies due to their lower gas fractions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02802v1" target="_blank"><h2>SDSS-V LVM: Resolving Physical Conditions in the Trifid Nebula</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Natascha Sattler, J.

However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02714v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quasinormal modes of a static black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mohsen Fathi, Ariel Guzmán, J.

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02693v1" target="_blank"><h2>Search for persistent radio emission towards selected localised Fast Radio Burst positions using the MeerKAT Telescope</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Thulo Letsele, Lebogang Mfulwane, Christo Venter, James O.

Currently, only three, and possible a fourth repeating FRBs (FRB20121102A, FRB20190417A, FRB20190520B, and FRB20240114A) have confirmed associations with a PRS. Insight into progenitors, local environments, and the evolution of FRBs can be clarified by characterising these PRSs. In this work, we present 2 detected candidate PRSs using MeerKAT radio telescope data and one non-detection (as part of a larger study involving 25 FRB positions). Both FRB20221106 and FRB20181112 were found to have a host galaxy, and whether the detected radio continuum emission comes from the host galaxy or PRS is still an open question. High-resolution observations from a telescope such as e-MERLIN are required to resolve this question. If a compact PRS is detected, this telescope will provide the size, and investigate the flux variability and spectral shape of this compact PRS.

In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02629v1" target="_blank"><h2>Silicate emission in a type-2 quasar: JWST/MIRI constraints on torus geometry and radiative feedback</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> C.

Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool {\tt BayesClumpy}. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors ($\rm C_T=0.45\pm^{0.26}_{0.18}$ and $\rm C_T=0.66\pm^{0.16}_{0.17}$ for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations ($\rm i=50^\circ\pm^{8^\circ}_{9^\circ}$ and $\rm i=13^\circ\pm^{7^\circ}_{6^\circ}$). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 72 papers (72 new, 0 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
