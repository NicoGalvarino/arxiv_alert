ultraviolet emission lines (\ion{C}{iii}]$\lambda1909$,
\ion{C}{iv}$\lambda1549$, \ion{He}{ii}]$\lambda1640$) of type~2 AGNs and their
metallicity ($Z$). This calibration is derived by comparing a large sample of
106 objects (data taken from the literature) located over a wide range of
redshifts ($0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 4.0$) with predictions from
photoionization models that adopt a recent C/O-O/H relation derived via
estimates using the $T_{\rm e}$ method, which is considered the most reliable
method. We found that the new calibration produces $Z$ values in agreement
(within an uncertainty of $\pm 0.1$ dex) with those from other calibrations and
from estimates via the $T_{\rm e}$-method. We find also that AGN metallicities
are already high at early epochs, with no evidence for monotonic evolution
across the redshift range $0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 12$. Notably, the
highest metallicities in our sample, reaching up to $\rm 4\: Z_{\odot}$, are
found in objects at $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$. This redshift range coincides
with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate history, suggesting a strong
connection between the major epoch of star formation, black hole growth, and
rapid metal enrichment in the host galaxies of AGNs. Furthermore, our analysis
reveals no significant correlation between AGN metallicity and radio properties
(radio spectral index or radio luminosity) or host galaxy stellar mass. The
lack of a clear mass-metallicity relation, consistent with findings for local
AGNs, suggests that the chemical evolution of the nuclear gas is decoupled from
the global properties of the host galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05319v1" target="_blank"><h2>The impact of galaxy bias on cross-correlation tomography</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sara Maleubre, Matteo Zennaro, David Alonso, Ian McCarthy, Matthieu Schaller, Joop Schaye</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 9 Figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The cross-correlation of galaxies at different redshifts with other tracers
of the large-scale structure can be used to reconstruct the cosmic mean of key
physical quantities, and their evolution over billions of years, at high
precision. However, a correct interpretation of these measurements must ensure
that they are independent of the clustering properties of the galaxy sample
used. In this paper we explore different prescriptions to extract tomographic
reconstruction measurements and use the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations to
show that a robust estimator, independent of the small-scale galaxy bias, can
be constructed. We focus on the tomographic reconstruction of the halo
bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle bP_e\rangle$ and star-formation
density $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$, which can be reconstructed from
tomographic analysis of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background maps,
respectively. We show that these quantities can be reconstructed with an
accuracy of 1-3\% over a wide range of redshifts, using different galaxy
samples. We also show that these measurements can be accurately interpreted
using the halo model, assuming a sufficiently reliable model can be constructed
for the halo mass function, large-scale halo bias, and for the dependence of
the physical quantities being reconstructed on halo mass.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04808v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evaluating the Accuracy of Reionization Prescriptions in Semi-analytic
  Models of the First Stars and Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Thomas Behling, Ryan Hazlett, Mihir Kulkarni, Eli Visbal</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to JCAP</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Semi-analytic models are a valuable tool to study the first stars and
galaxies. Their numerical efficiency makes it possible to survey broad regions
of astrophysical parameter space across large volumes and redshift ranges.
Following reionization in these models is necessary since star formation is
suppressed in ionized regions due to photoheating of the gas. Here we evaluate
the accuracy of three semi-analytic reionization prescriptions (two previously
developed and one new model) by comparing their three-dimensional distribution
of ionized bubbles to the Renaissance hydrodynamical cosmological radiative
transfer simulations. We find that the previously existing models accurately
determine the distribution of the larger bubbles within our ${\sim}6$ comoving
Mpc simulation box, but that these models fail to take into account
self-shielded neutral gas in dense filaments. Thus, these prescriptions
overestimate the fraction of halos in HII regions impacted by reionization
feedback by up to an order of magnitude (depending on halo mass and redshift).
This leads to an unrealistically large effect of reionization feedback on Pop
III stars and low-mass metal-enriched galaxies. Our newly developed model takes
into account the density structure of the cosmic web, leading to good agreement
with Renaissance in the fraction of halos found in ionized regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05195v1" target="_blank"><h2>CLASH-VLT: The variance of the velocity anisotropy profiles of galaxy

related to the shape of the orbits of their member galaxies. Knowledge of
$\beta(r)$ is important to understand the assembly process of clusters and the
evolutionary processes of their galaxies, and to improve the determination of
cluster masses based on cluster kinematics. We determine the $\beta(r)$ of nine
massive clusters at redshift $0.19 \leq z \leq 0.45$ from the CLASH-VLT data
set, with 150 to 950 spectroscopic members each, to understand how much
cluster-to-cluster variance exists in the $\beta(r)$ of different clusters and
what is the main driver of this variance. We select spectroscopic cluster
members with the CLUMPS algorithm calibrated on cosmological simulations. We
apply the MAMPOSSt code to the distribution of cluster members in projected
phase-space to constrain the cluster mass profile, $M(r)$, using priors derived
from a previous gravitational lensing analysis. Given the MAMPOSSt best-fit
solution for $M(r)$, we then solve the inversion of the Jeans equation to
determine $\beta(r)$ without assumptions of its functional form. We also run
the DS+ code to identify subclusters and characterize the dynamical status of
our clusters. The average $\beta(r)$ is slightly radial, with the anisotropy
increasing from $\beta \simeq 0.2$ at the cluster center, to $\beta \simeq 0.4$
at the virial radius. There is substantial variance in the $\beta(r)$ of the
individual clusters, that cannot be entirely accounted for by the observational
uncertainties. Clusters of lower mass and with a low concentration per given
mass have more tangential $\beta(r)$'s. Clusters hosting a rich subcluster have
$\beta(r)$ deviating more strongly from the average $\beta(r)$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05335v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity at z~2-3 with JWST/NIRISS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ayan Acharyya, Peter J.

spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies -- four from
JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the

covers a range of $8.0 <$ \logM $< 9.5$ in stellar mass, $0.2 <$
$\log{\rm{(SFR}}$/\Msunpyr) $< 1.1$ in star-formation rate (SFR) and $7.8 <$
\logOH $< 9.0$ in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN
demarcation in absence of resolved \halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation
line in the \textit{OHNO} parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly
available \hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient
relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps
hinting at the fact that the high-$z$ galaxies have not yet started their
accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially
resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of
metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale
increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass
galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04768v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Turbulent Framework for Star Formation in High-Redshift Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Guochao Sun, Claude-André Faucher-Giguère, Jonathan Stern</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 17 figures; submitted to AAS journals</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract), CGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of distant galaxies suggest that the physics of galaxy formation
at high redshifts differs significantly from later times. In contrast to large,
steady disk galaxies like the Milky Way, high-redshift galaxies are often
characterized by clumpy, disturbed morphologies and bursty star formation
histories. These differences between low-mass, bursty galaxies and higher-mass,
steady star-forming galaxies have recently been studied in galaxy formation
simulations with resolved multiphase ISM. These simulation studies indicate
that while steady disk galaxies can be well-modeled as "equilibrium disks"
embedded in a distinct, hot CGM, bursty galaxies are much more dynamic and
their star formation occurs in a dispersion-dominated medium that extends to
halo scales, with no clear boundary between the ISM and the CGM. We develop an
analytic framework to model star formation in bursty galaxies that are not
adequately modeled as equilibrium disks. The framework approximates the gas in
low-mass halos as a continuous, supersonically turbulent medium with large
density fluctuations. Star formation occurs locally in the high-density tail of
a roughly lognormal density distribution. This is analogous to turbulent models
of star formation in molecular clouds, but here applied on inner CGM scales. By
comparing with galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project, we show that
this framework can be used to understand star formation efficiencies and radial
profiles in halos. The turbulent framework shows explicitly how the
instantaneous galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency can be relatively low
even if the local efficiency in dense gas approaches unity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04958v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029

northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to
distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron
(Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029
using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized
equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61
keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions,
respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate
thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by
comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions.
Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and
inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation
and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central
region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4
keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely
consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However,
Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region
and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with
displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a
2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant
development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler
gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already
cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and
no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower
temperatures and form stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05052v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Size Evolution and the Size-Mass Relation of Lyman-Alpha Emitters

crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of
Ly$\alpha$ emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural
scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of
876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3 \lesssim z < 7$, selected from the
MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields.
Utilizing deep, high-resolution near-infrared images from the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST), we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective
radii ($R_{\rm e}$) through two-dimensional S\'{e}rsic profile fitting. Our
results show that these LAEs are generally compact with weak size evolution,
following $R_{\rm e,UV} \propto (1 + z)^{-0.91 \pm 0.10}$ and $R_{\rm e,V}
\propto (1 + z)^{-0.93 \pm 0.18}$, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are
statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients.
For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for
LAEs at $z>3$, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies
(SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results
provide important clues for understanding the formation mechanisms and
structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04778v1" target="_blank"><h2>JVLA and VLBA study of the merging cool core CHIPS 1911+4455 at z~0.5:

between non-cool core and cool core systems. While unusual, these objects can
help us understand the evolution of the most massive clusters. We investigated
the role of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the starburst brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG) of the merging cool core cluster CHIPS 1911+4455 (z =
0.485). We conducted new multifrequency (0.3 - 5 GHz) Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA) and Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations of CHIPS 1911+4455
across a wide range of scales (0.01 to 20 kpc). Our analysis reveals that the
AGN in the BCG has recently awakened, showing a compact core with symmetric,
~30 pc long jets in VLBA data. The onset of the AGN may be linked to the
enhanced cooling of the hot gas found in a previous study. At larger scales (10
kpc), faint radio whiskers extending to the south show a striking alignment
with star-forming knots and are thus interpreted as synchrotron-emitting
regions associated with the starburst BCG. The implied radio star formation
rate of 100 - 155 M$_{\odot}$/yr agrees with the optical/infrared one (140 -
190 M$_{\odot}$/yr). Our JVLA and VLBA radio study, informed by previous
X-ray/optical/millimeter works, indicates that CHIPS 1911+4455 represents a
transitional phase in cluster evolution, where the AGN in the central galaxy
has just begun to respond to copious hot gas cooling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04907v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGN Feedback Models and AGN Demographics I: Radio-Mode AGN in EAGLE,

galaxies at low redshifts to observations, finding large discrepancies between
cosmological simulation predictions and observed patterns. Modern cosmological
simulations include AGN feedback models tuned to reproduce the observed galaxy
stellar mass function. However, due to a lack of real understanding of the
physics of AGN feedback, these models vary significantly across simulations. To
distinguish between the models and potentially test the underlying physics, we
carry out independent tests of these models. In an earlier study, we found that
$F_{\rm AGN}$ -- the observed completeness-corrected fraction of galaxies
hosting radio AGN with an Eddington ratio $\lambda > 10^{-3}$ -- to be a strong
function of host galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) but nearly independent of host
specific star formation rates (sSFR) at fixed $M_\star$. In this study, we test
the radio mode AGN feedback models of the EAGLE, SIMBA, and TNG100 simulations
by comparing their predictions of $F_{\rm AGN} \left(M_\star \right)$ to our
observational constraint. We find that none of these simulations even
qualitatively reproduce the observed dependencies of $F_{\rm AGN}$ on $M_\star$
and sSFR. Finally, we find that although the given TNG100 model could be
modified in order to better reproduce the observed $F_{\rm AGN}$ trend, this
modification would likely also change its prediction for the local stellar mass
function and star formation rates -- key observations used for calibrating the
simulation in the first place. Our findings highlight a pressing need to
revisit the AGN feedback prescriptions in EAGLE, SIMBA, TNG100 and other
similar models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05467v1" target="_blank"><h2>Combined tracer analysis for DESI 2024 BAO</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  D. Valcin, M.

the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers new avenues to constrain the dark
matter (DM) distribution in our Galaxy. A key observable is the reflex motion
of the MW disc with respect to the halo induced by the LMC's infall, which
imprints a velocity dipole on kinematics of halo stars. Here we investigate how
the dipole varies with Galactocentric radius, and study the sensitivity of the
reflex motion signal to different DM outer-halo profiles. Using a suite of
basis function expansion (BFE) simulations with truncated NFW profiles ($\rho
\propto r^{-\beta}$ beyond $r=50$ kpc), our $N$-body models show that (i) The
reflex motion amplitude varies with Galactocentric radius but is largely
insensitive to the outer DM slope, implying that the MW-LMC mass ratio alone
does not set the dipole strength. (ii) In contrast, the direction of the disc
motion is very sensitive to the density distribution of the outer DM halo.
(iii) The contraction of the MW halo induced by the LMC's gravitational pull
also depends strongly on the outer DM halo profile. (iv) We find a halo
instability whose oscillation frequency increases with $\beta$ producing a
potentially observable signature - a sinusoidal pattern of the mean radial
velocity of halo stars. Finally, using BFE coefficients we find that steeper
truncations produce smaller dipole distortions, while amplifying the quadrupole
distortion. These results highlight the limited constraining power of the
reflex motion amplitude alone for outer MW profile parameters.</p></br></body>
