to characterize the Ly$\alpha$ emission lines from $z>6$ galaxies without
significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However,
Ly$\alpha$ line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars'
proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic
observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two $z>6$ quasar fields. We measure the
Ly$\alpha$ line fluxes for 50 galaxies at $6<z<7$ with UV absolute magnitude
$M_\text{UV}<-19$ (median $M_\text{UV}=-19.97$), among which 15 are located
near the luminous quasars, i.e. within $\Delta v<2500\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. We find
that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic
Ly$\alpha$ wavelength, and have higher Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width compared to
galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars'
environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the
Ly$\alpha$-emitter fraction from $z\sim6.4$ to $z\sim5$. Leveraging the low IGM
opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction
($f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}$) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis
suggests that galaxies at $\langle z\rangle\approx6.4$ have an average
$f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}=0.14\pm0.04$. This value is consistent with
reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low
$(f_\text{esc}^\text{LyC}\lesssim0.1)$ for luminous galaxies, and where the
most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing
photon budget.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05354v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST MIRI/MRS observations of hot molecular gas in an AGN host galaxy at

star formation by removing or destroying molecular gas from host galaxies via
radiation-pressure driven outflows and/or radio jets. Some studies of cold
molecular gas in galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$) show that AGN have less
cold gas ($<$100 K) compared to mass-matched star-forming galaxies. However,
cold gas could also be shock-heated to warmer phases, detectable via H$_{2}$
transitions in the rest-frame near- and mid-infrared spectra. The Medium
Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard JWST
has opened a unique window to observe these emission lines in galaxies at
Cosmic Noon. We present the first detection of hot molecular gas in cid_346, an
X-ray AGN at $z\sim2.2$, via the H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transition at 2.12
$\mu$m. We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{5}$
M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular
gas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and
satellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular
gas out to distances $>$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and
ancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of
$\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our
results tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase
dominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational
transitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that
may lack CO emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05380v1" target="_blank"><h2>BASS LII: Clues from Twin Peaks -- Investigating the structure of the

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the
accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN
selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we
systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN
with redshifts $0.004<z<0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7
(erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find
that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs),
consistent with rates previously reported for $z<0.2$ broad-line AGN selected
for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a
single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the
double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher
masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line
AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray
luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios
than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other
broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to
radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert
types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of
multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN,
including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look
events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component
disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized
contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial
SMBH mass estimates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05339v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the dark Universe with HI and EMBER-2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mauro Bernardini, Robert Feldmann, Daniel Anglés-Alcázar, Philipp Denzel, Jindra Gensior</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of
the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak
lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help
constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior,
and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI
observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation,
such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often
calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information
to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this
shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced
EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide
redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation
simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics,
including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark
matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to
scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional
approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future
inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis
tasks of radio surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05348v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Impact of Supernova Feedback on Satellites in

elliptical host galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations. Utilizing a modified
version of the GADGET-3 code, we perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of 11
elliptical galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{11} M_{\odot} < M_{*}
< 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We conduct two sets of simulations with
identical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase
SN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy
is released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison
shows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant
variations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN
feedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the
Fiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies
with stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model
generates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA
survey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below
$10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model
are about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the
Fiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In
conclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes
mechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with
observations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating both mechanical
AGN and SN feedback to reproduce the observed properties of elliptical galaxy
and their satellites in simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05848v1" target="_blank"><h2>PDRs4All XV. Tracing AIB characteristics in PDR spectra with PAHFIT in

the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in
Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program,
are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming
regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool
that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission,
gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion
Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in
detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are
compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT.
  We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to
spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an
alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default
PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. PAHFIT fits with
the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model reproduce the Orion Bar spectra
with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the
NGC7469 spectra.
  We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the
3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of
the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two
subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one
preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small
grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the
molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify
the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and
NGC7469.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06163v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstructing PTA measurements via early seeding of supermassive black

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the
early Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways.
Separately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses
$\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz
gravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).
Owing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming
earlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a
formalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA
signal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of
high-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and
collapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs,
with comoving seed number density of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$
can be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $> 10^9 M_\odot$
binaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z< 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via
the DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much
larger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis
further suggests that the seed number density should be $< \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})
\, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06131v1" target="_blank"><h2>The HI-to-H2 transition in the Draco cloud</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nicola Schneider, Volker Ossenkopf-Okada, Markus Roellig, Daniel Seifried, Ralf S.

observational studies of the atomic hydrogen (HI) to molecular hydrogen (H2)
transition in the interstellar medium. We focussed on the Draco diffuse cloud
to gain deeper insights into the physical properties of the transition from HI
to H2. We employed the total hydrogen column density probability distribution
function (N-PDF) derived from Herschel dust observations and the N(HI)-PDF
obtained from HI data collected by the Effelsberg HI survey. The N-PDF of the
Draco cloud exhibits a double-log-normal distribution, whereas the N(HI)-PDF
follows a single log-normal distribution. The HI-to-H2 transition is identified
as the point where the two log-normal components of the dust N-PDF contribute
equally; it occurs at Av = 0.33 (N=6.2e20 cm^-2). The low-column-density
segment of the dust N-PDF corresponds to the cold neutral medium, which is
characterized by a temperature of around 100 K. The higher-column-density part
is predominantly associated with H2. The shape of the Draco N-PDF is
qualitatively reproduced by numerical simulations. In the absence of
substantial stellar feedback, such as radiation or stellar winds, turbulence
exerts a significant influence on the thermal stability of the gas and can
regulate the condensation of gas into denser regions and its subsequent
evaporation. Recent observations of the ionized carbon line at 158 micron in
Draco support this scenario. Using the KOSMA-tau photodissociation model, we
estimate a gas density of n=50 cm^-3 and a temperature of 100 K at the location
of the HI-to-H2 transition. Both the molecular and atomic gas components are
characterized by supersonic turbulence and strong mixing, suggesting that
simplified steady-state chemical models are not applicable under these
conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05679v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Comprehensive Look at PUDG-R21: Stellar Population and Kinematics of a

globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic
observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional
velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its
association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of
15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of
19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From
this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$
M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our
dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated
stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of
10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex)
and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star
formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to
or during the galaxy's infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr
ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity)
indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the
involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population
of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more
metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation
suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf
population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.</p></br></body>
