Ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to
influence the evolution of their host galaxies and super-massive black holes
(SMBHs). Distance is important to understand the kinetic power of the outflows
as a cosmic feedback channel. However, the distance of the outflows with
respect to the central engine is poorly constrained. The density of the
outflows is an essential parameter for estimating the distance of the outflows.
NGC 5548 exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in its archival spectra,
which can be used for density analysis. Aims. We aim to use the variability of
the absorption lines from the archival spectra to obtain a density constraint
and then estimate the distance of the outflows. Methods. We used the archival
observations of NGC 5548 taken with Chandra in January 2002 to search for
variations of the absorption lines. Results. We found that the Mg XII
Ly${\alpha}$ and the O VIII Ly${\beta}$ absorption lines have significant
variation on the 144 ks time scale and the 162 ks time scale during the
different observation periods. Based on the variability timescales and the
physical properties of the variable components that dominated these two
absorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the density of the variable warm
absorber components in the range of $7.2-9.0{\times}10^{11} m^{-3}$, and an
upper limit on their distance from the central source in the range of 0.2-0.5
pc.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19795v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the formation of star-forming galaxies having anomalously
  low-metallicity regions: the role of galaxy interaction and CGM/IGM accretion</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yibo Cao, Zhizheng Pan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 16 figures, ApJ accepted</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> CGM (title, abstract), IGM (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gas accretion from both the circum-galactic medium (CGM)/inter-galatic medium
(IGM) and interacting companion galaxy can dilute the gas phase metallicity of
a galaxy. However, their relative contribution to the chemical evolution of
galaxies remains to be quantified. To this end, in this work we study a sample
of 510 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) having anomalously low-metallicity (ALM)
regions selected from the MaNGA data available in the Data Release 17 from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. ALM regions are defined as those having gas phase
metallicities that are at least $\sim 2\sigma$ lower than the emprical relation
between stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_{*}$) and gas phase metallicity,
i.e., the $\Sigma_{*}-Z$ relation. We find that ALM galaxies have higher star
formation rates and \Hi~gas fractions than normal SFGs at fixed $M_*$.
$\sim$25\% of the ALM galaxies exhibit tidal features, while the tidal fraction
is only $\sim$12\% for normal SFGs, indicating that galaxy interaction is an
important factor responsible for the ALM phenomenon. To explore the origin of
non-tidal ALM galaxies, we compare their morphologies and environments with
those of mass-matched normal SFGs. We find that non-tidal ALM galaxies tend to
have more disk-dominated morphologies and reside in less-dense environment.
These findings suggest that cold gas accretion from the CGM/IGM is the primary
cause for the ALM phenomenon, while galaxy interaction plays a minor but
non-negligible role.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19444v1" target="_blank"><h2>Infrared fine-structure lines at high redshift</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Roberto Decarli, Tanio Diaz-Santos</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Published in A&ARv.

de-excitation of collisionally-excited electrons in atoms and ions. Thanks to
their high luminosities and relatively simple physics, IR FSLs have quickly
become the workhorse for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in
the nearby and distant Universe. In this review, we introduce the physics of
FSL emission and the diagnostics of the ISM that we can derive from them via
first principle arguments. We summarize the history of FSL observations with a
focus on the far-IR wavelengths and a particular emphasis on the on-going
efforts aimed at characterizing galaxies at cosmic noon and beyond. We explore
the dependence of emission line trends, such as those observed in `line
deficits' or [CII]-SFR relations, as a function of redshift and galaxy types.
Once selection biases are controlled for, IR FSLs are a powerful tool to
constrain the physics of galaxies. The precise redshift information inferred
from fine-structure line observations have enabled tracing their ISM properties
across cosmic reionization. FSL observations have also led to estimates of the
mass of different ISM phases, and of the SFR of distant galaxies. It is thanks
to IR FSL observations that we have been able to measure the internal dynamics
of high-z galaxies, which in turns has allowed us to test, e.g., the onset of
black hole - host galaxy relations in the first billion years of the Universe
and the presence of gas outflows associated with the baryon cycle in galaxies.
Finally, FSLs have provided important clues on the physics of the ISM in the
most distant galaxies known to date. We demonstrate the strength and
limitations of using IR FSLs to advance our understanding of galaxy formation
and evolution in the early universe, and we outline future perspective for the
field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19575v1" target="_blank"><h2>SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper: The Index Diagram as a tool to disentangle the

stellar component from the host galaxy (HG) on the emission line spectra of the
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We first detect spectra with broad emission lines
using a line ratio method for a sample of $\sim$3000 high SNR ($>$20) Black
Hole Mapper objects (part of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey).
We then built the Index diagram, a novel diagnostic tool using the
$z$-corrected spectra, model-free, designed to easily identify spectra with
significant stellar HG contributions and to classify the AGN spectra into three
categories based on AGN-HG dominance: HG-dominated (HGD), Intermediate (INT),
and AGN-dominated (AGND) sources. A colour-$z$ diagram was used to refine the
AGN-HG classification. We subtract the stellar contributions from the HGD and
INT spectra before modeling the AGN spectrum to extract the QMS parameters. Our
QMS reveals that HGD galaxies predominantly occupy the Population B region with
no \rfe, %FWHM$\gtrsim$4000 \kms, with outliers exhibiting \rfe\ $>$ 1, likely
due to HG subtraction residuals and a faint contribution of \hbbc. INT and AGND
spectra show similar distributions in the Population A %FWHM(\hbbc)$<$4000
\kms\ region, while in Population B, %For broader lines, a tail of AGND sources
becomes apparent. Cross-matching with radio, infrared, and X-ray catalogs, we
find that the strongest radio emitters are associated with HGD and INT groups.
Strong X-ray emitters are found in INT and AGND sources, also occupying the AGN

cosmic dawn takes place in dense gaseous environments, which play a crucial
role in shaping their coevolution and radiation spectra. We investigate gas
accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M_{\rm h}\gtrsim
10^{10-11}~M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding
and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\sim 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$
via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope
whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T_{\rm eff}\simeq
5000~{\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar
population of $\sim 10^7~M_\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early
coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of
the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active
galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and
weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear
starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel
gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately
drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the
optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L_{\rm opt}/L_{\rm
UV}\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\simeq 15~{\rm Myr}$,
one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this
ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward
lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the
LRD characteristics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19514v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nulling baryonic feedback in weak lensing surveys using

cosmology using cosmic shear. This has meant omitting much of the data during
cosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas
around dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic
feedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose
a novel method of ``baryon nulling'' using cross-correlations between shear
maps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting
the dark matter--dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our
nulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without
any explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic
simulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback
variations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback
modeling at $k \approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This
points toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB
surveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin,
Euclid, and Roman.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19475v1" target="_blank"><h2>Early galaxy evolution: The complex interstellar medium distribution of

at $z = 7.1$ in bands 3, 6, and 8 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array. These high-resolution observations ($\approx 200$ pc) enabled us to
separate the source into five components in the [CII] 158$\mu$m and [OIII]
88$mu$m emission lines within a projected distance of 2 kpc. Even though these
components appear to vary strongly from one another in both their line,
continuum, and optical characteristics, the assembly of components do not show
ordered rotation and appear consistent with simulations of a galaxy system
undergoing the process of assembly. The total dynamical mass of the galaxy
($2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) is an order of magnitude larger than the
spectrally estimated stellar mass, suggesting a near-complete optical
obscuration of the bulk of the stellar component. Comparing the line ratios as
well as the line properties to other properties such as the star formation
rate, we find that A1689-zD1 is consistent with the relations derived from
local star-forming galaxies. Even though A1689-zD1 lies on local star formation
scaling relations and has a high dust and stellar mass estimate, the kinematics
suggest it is in an early assembly stage, which could lead to it becoming a

of this numerical two-moment CRMHD solver. We finally use the new two-moment CR

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), feedback (title, abstract), stellar feedback (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their
surroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly
affects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having
stronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass
distribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback,
particularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We
investigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since
clusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback
dependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields
fewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff
densities of $10,\ 10^{1.5},\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf
galaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We
calculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe,
stellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for
clouds with $n>100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution
for complexes with $n>10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of
radiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts
our hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to
feedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence,
suggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass
function must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and,
in the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature. (shortened)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18833v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effects of galactic environment on accretion dynamics onto a rotating

inviscid accretion flow onto a rotating black hole has been systematically
investigated using three distinct disc geometries and two thermodynamic
equations of state, within the framework of a pseudo-Kerr potential. To enhance
astrophysical realism, the study incorporates a multi-component galactic
potential, modeling the influence of the surrounding stellar distribution, dark
matter, and hot gas with the central blackhole. Our analysis reveals that the
inclusion of the galactic potential induces subtle yet noteworthy shifts in the
locations of sonic points. This effect is particularly pronounced in the
vertical equilibrium disc model, where the region allowing for shock formation
undergoes significant modification. The nature of critical points is determined
by analyzing the eigenvalues of the corresponding stability matrix,
establishing that multi-transonicity is restricted to a finite range of angular
momentum. Shock strength and associated dynamic \& thermodynamic
quantities-such as mach number, pressure, density and temperature-are found to
vary sensitively with galactic parameters, and are illustrated through
comprehensive parametric plots. Additionally, a time-dependent linear
perturbation analysis, demonstrates that the governing perturbation equations
retain their structural form even in the presence of a galactic potential. The
flows remain stable under adiabatic, radially propagating perturbations.
Interestingly, the perturbative framework naturally gives rise to an emergent
acoustic metric, identifying the system as a classical analogue of gravity. The
corresponding acoustic surface gravity is analytically derived and shown to
exhibit a dependence on both the spin of the black hole and the characteristics
of the surrounding galactic environment.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19251v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy groups in various evolutionary stages</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kethelin Parra Ramos, C.

In
particular, that of fossil groups (FGs) is still under debate. Due to the
relative rarity of FGs, large samples of such objects are still missing. The
present paper aims to analyse the properties of groups in various evolutionary
stages (FGs, "almost" FGs, and non-FGs), and to increase the sample of FG
candidates. We have spectroscopically observed galaxies in four groups and ten
candidate FGs detected in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We
searched for substructures by applying the Serna-Gerbal dendrogram method to
analyse the dynamical structure of each group. By applying the FIREFLY software
to the continuum and PIPE_VIS to the emission lines, we derived the stellar
population properties in various regions for each group. A roughly continuous
variation in properties is found between a group that is still building up
(XCLASS 1330), a well-formed massive group (MCG+00-27-023), a dynamically
complex non-FG (NGC 4065), and a near-FG (NGC 4104). We also optically confirm
two FGs in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, but their X-ray
luminosity is still unknown. We observe that the lower the mass of the
substructure, the more recent the stellar population in the considered groups.
We also show an apparent lack of high-mass substructures for low-metallicity
systems. These results are consistent with the generally adopted model of
energy transfer during interactions of the galaxies with the group and cluster
potential wells. Furthermore, the fossil status of a group might be related to
the large-scale environment. Therefore, studying the positions of non-FGs,
near-FGs, and FGs within the cosmic web can provide insights into the process
of how fossil systems come into being in the Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19548v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Bulge Morphology of Dual AGN Host Galaxies from the

(AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in
compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy
mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be
disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using
SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for
131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets)
identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived s\'ersic indices, luminosities,
masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical,
with s\'ersic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are
elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies.
Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span
$1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems
being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical
(E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D)
mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is
elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is
limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved,
red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are
predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than
star-forming disc galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18728v1" target="_blank"><h2>The inside-out quenching of the MHONGOOSE galaxy NGC 1371</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S.

distributed in a regularly rotating disc with a hole $\sim5$ kpc wide around
the galactic centre. The continuum observations reveal, within the HI hole,
emission from one of the lowest luminosity AGN known to date and from two

perpendicular to it. We found indication for jet-induced ionised outflows

$M_{\text{H$_2$}}<2\times10^5\text{ M$_\odot$}$) is detected. The emerging
picture is that the gas in the central regions has been rapidly depleted by the
stellar bar or, despite its low power, the AGN in NGC 1371 is efficiently
heating and/or removing the gas through the jets and possibly by radiative
winds, leading to the inside-out quenching of the galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19449v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Yin-Yang Galaxy Cluster Merger in Abell 1914 Revealed by XRISM</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Annie Heinrich, Congyao Zhang, Irina Zhuravleva, Eugene Churazov, Hannah McCall, Reinout J. van Weeren, William R.

gravitational energy into thermal and kinetic energy in the local universe.
Understanding this process requires the reconstruction of cluster merger
geometry, with careful consideration of projection effects. With its
unprecedented spectral resolution, XRISM enables the disentanglement of merging
cluster components along the line-of-sight via X-rays for the first time. In
this letter, we focus on the massive cluster A1914, a puzzling case wherein the
galaxy and dark matter distribution appear to be in tension with the X-ray
morphology. We present XRISM observations of A1914 focusing on the velocity
structure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The Resolve full-array spectrum
requires two merging components along the line-of-sight, with bulk velocities
offset by $\sim$1000 km/s and velocity dispersions of $\sim$200 km/s. The
sub-array maps of flux ratios, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion show the
two components are offset and overlapping in the plane of the sky, consistent
with a major (mass ratio $\sim$3), near line-of-sight merger with a pericenter
distance of $\sim$200 kpc. We conclude that the two subclusters create an
overlapping spiral pattern, referred to as a ''yin-yang'' merger. This scenario
is further supported by tailored hydrodynamical simulations of the A1914
merger, demonstrating that this type of merger can broadly reproduce the
observed X-ray morphology, gas temperature map, gas velocity maps, dark matter
distribution, and galaxy velocities. This work demonstrates the power of

than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within $\Lambda$CDM,
showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically
mature galaxies. Departures from $\Lambda$CDM prior to recombination can
imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this
paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally
proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these
high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the
pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and
produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with
JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations.
Predictions converge to $\Lambda$CDM at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 3$),
thereby preserving all successes of $\Lambda$CDM. This model also accelerates
the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities
by $\sim 0.5$ dex at $z\simeq 6$-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of
massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe
physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the
Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of $\Lambda$CDM. This
opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models
with forthcoming observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19842v1" target="_blank"><h2>DARKSKIES: A suite of super-sampled zoom-in simulations of galaxy

simulations of massive ($M_{200}>5\times10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot)$ galaxy clusters
with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such
that $m_{\rm DM}/m_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter
particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster,
whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We
calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and
realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of
velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future
telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the
density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of
cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z<0.5$). We
investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter
halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not
observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by
accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at
$z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the
existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the
dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic
oscillation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20079v1" target="_blank"><h2>The distribution and origin of metals in simulated Milky Way-like

elements in different stellar components of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies
in relation to their mass assembly history, stellar age, and metallicity. Using
a sample of 23 simulated galaxies from the Auriga project, we analysed the
evolution of heavy elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. To study the
chemical evolution of the stellar halo, bulge, and warm and cold discs of the
model galaxies, we applied a decomposition method to characterise the
distribution of chemical elements at $z=0$ and traced back their origin. Our
findings indicate that each stellar component has a distinctive chemical trend
despite galaxy-to-galaxy variations. Specifically, stellar haloes are
$\alpha$-enhanced relative to other components, representing the oldest
populations, with [Fe/H] ~ $-$0.6 and a high fraction of ex situ stars of ~
50%. They are followed by the warm ([Fe/H] ~ $-$0.1) and cold ([Fe/H] ~ 0)
discs, with in situ fractions of ~ 90% and ~ 95%, respectively. Alternatively,
bulges are mainly formed in situ but host more diverse stellar populations,
with [Fe/H] abundance extending over ~ 1 dex around the solar value. We
conclude that one of the main drivers shaping the chemical properties of the
galactic components in our simulations is the age-metallicity relation. The
bulges are the least homogeneous component of the sample, as they present
different levels of contribution from young stars in addition to the old
stellar component. Conversely, the cold discs appear very similar in all
chemical properties, despite important differences in their typical formation
times. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of stars in the warm discs
were in the cold disc at birth. We discuss the possible connections of this
behaviour with the development of bars and interactions with satellites.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18770v1" target="_blank"><h2>SDSS-IV MaNGA: Data-Model Discrepancy in Temperature-sensitive Line

Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title, abstract), dust (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gas-phase metallicity is a fundamental parameter that helps constrain the
star-forming history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Measuring electron
temperature through auroral-to-strong line ratios is a direct approach to
deriving metallicity. However, there is a longstanding discrepancy between
metallicity measured through the direct method and that based on the
photoionization models. This paper aims to verify and understand the
discrepancies. We bin ~ 1.5 million spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA according to
metallicity and ionization parameters derived from theoretical strong-line
calibrations. We stack the spectra of spaxels within each bin and measure the
flux of strong lines and faint auroral lines. Auroral lines for [OII], [SII],
[OIII], and [SIII] are detected in the stacked spectra of most bins, and the
[NII] auroral line is detected in fewer bins. We apply an empirical method to
correct dust attenuation, which makes more realistic corrections for low
ionization lines. We derive electron temperatures for these five ionic species
and measure the oxygen and sulfur abundances using the direct method. We
present the resulting abundance measurements and compare them with those
model-calibrated strong-line abundances. The chemical abundances measured with
the direct method are lower than those derived from the photoionization model,
with a median of 0.09 dex. This discrepancy is smaller compared to the results
based on other metallicity calibrations previously reported. However, we notice
that the direct method could not account for the variation in ionization
parameters, indicating that the precise calibration of metallicity using the
direct method has yet to be fully realized. We report significant discrepancies
between data and the photoionization model, which illustrates that the
one-dimensional photoionization model is incapable of representing the
complexity of real situations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19666v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Bolometric Luminosity Correction Recipe for AGN at Any Epoch</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mojegan Azadi, Belinda Wilkes, Joanna Kuraszkiewicz, Steven.

Ashby</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies
requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e.,
bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy
distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH)
mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total
radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating
the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$--$90^\circ$
inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding
double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of
visible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting
bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but
only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks
peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield
hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the
visible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly
isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100\AA-3000\AA)
show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend
strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450\AA),
parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for
estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though
dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our
SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1
AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by
the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.</p></br></body>
