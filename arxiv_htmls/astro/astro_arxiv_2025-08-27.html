the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is intimately connected to the fueling and
feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. IGM attenuation interferes
with high-redshift LyC observations, but growing samples of LyC observations at
z < 0.1 are revealing the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies. Along with
multi-wavelength observations of nearby LyC-emitting candidates, cosmological
simulations, and simulations of LyC escape from star-forming clouds, recent
studies are providing insights into the physics of LyC escape and the possible
characteristics of the galaxies that reionized the universe. Here, I review
progress in LyC detections, the inferred indirect signatures of LyC escape and
their application to high redshift, and our current understanding of the
physical conditions that lead to high LyC escape. These findings include:
LyC-emitting populations are diverse, and multiple factors correlate with LyC
escape, particularly neutral gas absorption, dust attenuation, nebular
ionization, and concentrated star formation. Radiative feedback plays a
critical role in the youngest starbursts with the highest LyC escape fractions,
but mechanical feedback may also contribute. Further research is needed to
clarify the timing and role of different feedback mechanisms and to connect
local LyC-production sites with the broader interstellar medium. Indirect LyC
diagnostics show promise, but we need to understand whether and how the
properties of LyC-emitting galaxies evolve from low to high redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18823v1" target="_blank"><h2>An ALMA Band 7 survey of SDSS/Herschel quasars in Stripe 82: I. The

ranging from 10^{12} to 10^{14} Lsun, suggestive of star formation rates (SFRs)
of up to several thousand Msun/yr. Due to the limited spatial resolution of
SPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from
the quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam.
High-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are
needed to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we
unambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of
152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these
systems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as
triggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and
extreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a
single counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of
the quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between
redshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad
absorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed
in a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow
efficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH
growth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the
serendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the
eight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts
of the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating
that the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally,
we also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both
in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19170v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar Mass Assembly History of Massive Quiescent Galaxies since

morphology than their local counterparts. To examine their internal structure
across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we
performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive
$(\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim11)$ quiescent galaxies at $0 < z < 4$ with public James
Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging data from the Public
Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research and the Cosmic Evolution Early
Release Science Survey. We find that at $z \sim 3.5$, the half-mass radius is
about 5.4 times smaller than at $z \sim 0.5$. This growth is driven by stellar
mass buildup in the outskirts ($r > 4$ kpc), while the central regions ($r \sim
1$ kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to
local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to
explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass
accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the
size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as
$\log(R_{e,mass}) \propto \alpha \log(M_*)$, and find $\alpha =
2.67^{+1.14}_{-1.17}$ for $z\lessapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by
minor mergers, and $\alpha = 0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for $z\gtrapprox2$,
consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that
massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow
through combinations of minor and major mergers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18704v1" target="_blank"><h2>Connecting The Hierarchically Merging Binary Black Hole Population To

$\sim\,80-150\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ suggests that some proportion of black hole
binary systems form hierarchically in dense astrophysical environments, as most
stellar evolution models cannot explain the origin of these massive black holes
through isolated binary evolution. A significant fraction of such mergers could
occur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual
black hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large
localization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the
fraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular
cross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy
catalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky
localizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin
scenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN. We find
that if the observed merging population is dominated by binaries formed
dynamically in AGN, then this could be determined with $\mathcal{O}(5000)$
mergers detected at the sensitivity that is projected for the upcoming A\#
gravitational wave detectors.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19126v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the HI distribution at small scales using 21-cm Intensity

the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z
\lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature
of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is
distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the
HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we
investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and
bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation,
which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we
consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured
21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are
well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely
$[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS
and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it
is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation.
We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy
formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores
redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we
plan to address in future work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18369v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Uniform Analysis of Gas-phase Metallicity Evolution with 1-3 Gyr Time

mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FMR)
using uniform metallicity diagnostics across redshifts $z\sim0$ to $z\sim3.3$.
We present new Keck/DEIMOS measurements of the [OII]$\lambda\lambda3726,3729$
emission line doublet for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with existing
measurements of redder rest-optical lines from the MOSDEF survey. These new
observations enable uniform estimation of the gas-phase oxygen abundance using
ratios of the [OII], H$\beta$, and [OIII] lines for mass-binned samples of
star-forming galaxies in 6 redshift bins, employing strong-line calibrations
that account for the distinct interstellar medium ionization conditions at
$z<1$ and $z>1$. We find that the low-mass power law slope of the MZR remains
constant over this redshift range with a value of $\gamma=0.28\pm0.01$,
implying the outflow metal loading factor
($\zeta_\text{out}=\frac{Z_{\text{out}}}{Z_{\text{ISM}}}\frac{\dot{M}_{\text{out}}}{\text{SFR}}$)
scales approximately as $\rm \zeta_{out}\propto M_*^{-0.3}$ out to at least
$z\sim3.3$. The normalization of the MZR at $10^{10}\ \text{M}_\odot$ decreases
with increasing redshift at a rate of $d\log(\text{O/H})/dz =-0.11\pm0.01$
across the full redshift range. We find that any evolution of the FMR is
smaller than 0.1 dex out to $z\sim3.3$. We compare to cosmological galaxy
formation simulations, and find that IllustrisTNG matches our measured
combination of a nearly-invariant MZR slope, rate of MZR normalization
decrease, and constant or very weakly evolving FMR. This work provides the most
detailed view of MZR and FMR evolution from the present day through Cosmic Noon
with a fine time sampling of $1-3$ Gyr, setting a robust baseline for
metallicity evolution studies at $z>4$ with JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18344v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unified Gas Heating Constraints on Extended Dark Matter Compact Objects</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  TaeHun Kim, Philip Lu, Volodymyr Takhistov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 44 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (abstract), LLS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the first unified constraints on a broad class of extended dark

axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial
black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of
theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the
interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if
sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity.
Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by
incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration
through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed
numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results
to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter

While traditional cosmological simulations often assume a fixed dust-to-gas
(DTG) or dust-to-metal (DTM) mass ratio to model dust effects, recent
advancements have enabled on-the-fly (OTF) dust modeling that captures the
spatial and temporal evolution of dust. In this work, we investigate the impact
of dust modeling on galaxy morphology using the NewCluster simulation, which
implements a detailed OTF dust model. We generate mock images of NewCluster
galaxies under both OTF and fixed DTM models using the radiative transfer code
SKIRT, and compare their morphology to JWST observations. We measure morphology
indices and use the $G-M_{20}$ test to classify galaxies. We find that the OTF
galaxy models exhibit brighter centers and more pronounced bulges than those of
the fixed DTM models, resulting in a lower late-type galaxy (LTG) fraction,
particularly at high redshifts. This central brightening is linked to a
phenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM
ratio driven by intense bulge starbursts. Our results highlight the importance
of modeling dust evolution in a physically motivated manner, as fixed DTM
models fail to capture key morphological features.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18347v1" target="_blank"><h2>The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields: new probabilistic

formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), encoding the evolution of activity
in the Universe. To investigate its nature, we probabilistically classified
4,471 radio sources at z < 0.947 using low-frequency radio data from the LoTSS
Deep Fields alongside a multi-component model for nebular emission, sampled by
spectra obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This was
done by combining three tools: (i) the identification of a radio excess, (ii)
the BPT diagram, and (iii) a modified Mass Excitation diagram, alongside Monte
Carlo methods to estimate the probability that each source is either a
star-forming galaxy (SFG), a radio-quiet AGN (RQ AGN), or a
high-\low-excitation radio galaxy (HERG or LERG). This approach extends the
probabilistic classification framework of previous works by nearly doubling the
redshift range, such that we can now probabilistically classify sources over
the latter half of cosmic history. Often regarded as the 'gold standard'
method, spectroscopic classifications allow us to evaluate the performance of
other methods. Using a 90 per cent reliability threshold, we find reasonable
overall agreement (~77 per cent) with state-of-the-art photometric
classifications, but significant differences remain, including that we identify
2-5 times more RQ AGN. Furthermore, our high-confidence spectroscopic
classifications show that radiatively-efficient and inefficient AGN exhibit
clearly distinct Eddington-scaled accretion rate distributions, contrary to
recent findings in the literature. Overall, our results highlight the need for
new and forthcoming spectroscopic campaigns targeting radio sources, on the
pathway to the SKA.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18358v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Missing Hard Photons of Little Red Dots: Their Incident Ionizing

their continuum emission, with lines assumed to arise from a broad-line region.
In this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic
properties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension
between the ionizing properties implied from H$\alpha$ and HeII$\,\lambda$4686.
The high H$\alpha$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest
AGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally
detected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra.
The low HeII/H$\beta$ ($\sim10^{-2}$, $ < 20\times$ local AGN median) further
points to an unusually soft ionizing spectrum. We extend our analysis to dense
gas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen
recombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII
remains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with
Cloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations
include: exotic AGN with red rest-optical emission; a very high {\it average}
optical depth ($>10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant
H-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite
of AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen
densities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters
are found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While
previous studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing
hydrogen cloud, the HeII-based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial
step toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18848v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic-ray ionisation rate in low-mass cores: the role of the

dynamical evolution of star-forming regions. Their effect is quantified mainly
by means of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\zeta_2$.
  Aims: We aim to obtain a sample of $\zeta_2$ measurements in 20 low-mass
starless cores embedded in different parental clouds, to assess the average
level of ionisation in this kind of sources and to investigate the role of the
environment in this context. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and
Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the Taurus
cloud and the other isolated cores we targeted.
  Methods: We compute $\zeta_2$ using an analytical method based on the {column
density} of ortho-$\rm H_2D^+$, the CO abundance, and the deuteration level of
HCO$^+$. To estimate these quantities, we analysed new, high-sensitivity
molecular line observations obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment
(APEX) single-dish telescope and archival continuum data from Herschel.
  Results: We report $\zeta_2$ estimates in 17 cores in our sample and provide
upper limits on the three remaining sources. The values span almost two orders
of magnitude, from $1.3 \times 10^{-18}\, \rm s^{-1}$ to $8.5 \times 10^{-17}\,
\rm s^{-1}$.
  Conclusions: We find no significant correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the
core's column densities $N\rm (H_2)$. On the contrary, we find a positive
correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the cores' temperature, estimated via
Herschel data: cores embedded in warmer environments present higher ionisation
levels. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis,
where star formation activity is higher than in the other clouds we targeted.
The higher ionisation rates in these regions support the scenario that low-mass
protostars in the vicinity of our targeted cores contribute to the
re-acceleration of local cosmic rays.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18778v1" target="_blank"><h2>The life and times of dark matter haloes: what will I be when I grow up?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Julian Onions, Frazer Pearce, Alexander Knebe, Meghan Gray, Roan Haggar, Ulrike Kuchner, Ana Contreras-Santos, Gustavo Yepes, Weiguang Cui</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 7 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (abstract), halo (title, abstract), haloes (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Are the most massive objects in the Universe today the direct descendants of
the most massive objects at higher redshift? We address this question by
tracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2
simulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic
time, we find that only 40\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z =
1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most
dominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at
high redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The
hierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive
haloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing
rapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse
evolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience
steady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in
self-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects
maintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we
test this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within
the $(1 h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters
enter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that
cluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of
objects can enter and leave the sample over time. These findings have important
implications for observational cluster selection and comparisons between
simulations and surveys, especially at high redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18517v1" target="_blank"><h2>Physical properties of gas departing from circular rotation at 50 pc

modelling of data cubes and applied it to the PHANGS-MUSE H$\alpha$ spectral
lines to recover the underlying circular, noncircular motions, as well as the
intrinsic velocity dispersion in these objects. The PHANGS-MUSE galaxies
exhibit rotation supported disks with $V_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma_\mathrm{intrin}$
ratios $\gtrsim$ 5. Our analysis revealed ionized gas exhibiting noncircular
motions at different amplitudes, with low velocity amplitudes of about
$5\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ associated with the axisymmetric rotation component,
deviations of $\sim10\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ primarily linked to interarm and
spiral arms, and larger deviations ($>20 \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$), found in the
central and bar regions. We found that the velocity dispersion and the strength
of ionization correlate with the amplitude of noncircular motions, suggesting
that the underlying dynamics of the warm gas are closely tied to its physical

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk
galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical
evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for
external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day
radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar
radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates.
In the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated
by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading
impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very
central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a
net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk,
migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are
overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward,
whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they
themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed
and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically
underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have
direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys
such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for
stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk
mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius
estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.</p></br></body>
