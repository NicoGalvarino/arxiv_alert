Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the
intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space
Telescope is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing
sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction
of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape
fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a
critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to
escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to
observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift
galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since
ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic
absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial
resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core
challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are
generated on scales of 1-100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the
circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. A UV integral field unit
(IFU) spectrograph capable of resolving galaxies across these scales is
necessary--and uniquely achievable with the proposed Habitable Worlds
Observatory. In this article, we outline the scientific motivation,
observables, and observational capabilities needed to make progress on these
fundamental questions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23669v1" target="_blank"><h2>Even Redder than we Knew: Color and $A_{\mathrm{V}}$ Evolution up to

with exquisite depth and accuracy. This affords an unprecedented view of the
evolution of the UV-optical-near-IR color distribution and its interpretation
in terms of the evolving dust attenuation, $A_{\mathrm{V}}$. We use the
value-added data products (photometric redshift, stellar mass, rest-frame $U-V$
and $V-J$ colors, and $A_{\rm V}$) provided by the public DAWN JWST Archive.
This data product derives from fitting the spectral energy distributions
obtained from multiple NIRCam imaging surveys, augmented with pre-existing HST
imaging data. Our sample consists of a stellar mass complete sample of $\approx
28,000$ $M_\star> 10^{9}~M_\odot$ galaxies in the redshift range $0.5<z<2.5$.
The $V-J$ color distribution of star-forming galaxies evolves strongly, in
particular for high-mass galaxies ($M_\star>3\times 10^{10}~M_\odot$), which
have a pronounced tail of very red galaxies reaching $V-J> 2.5$ at $z>1.5$ that
does not exist at $z<1$. Such red $V-J$ can only be explained by dust
attenuation, with typical values for $M_\star \approx 10^{11}~M_\odot$ galaxies
in the range $A_{\mathrm{V}}\approx 1.5-3.5$ at $z\approx 2$. This redshift
evolution went largely unnoticed before because the photometric redshift
estimates for the reddest ($V-J>2.5$), most attenuated galaxies has markedly
improved thanks to the new, precise photometry. Despite the increased
attenuation, $U-V$ colors across the entire mass range are slightly bluer at
higher $z$. In conclusion, whereas the rest-frame UV-optical color distribution
evolves remarkably little from $z=0.5$ to $z=2.5$, the rest-frame
optical-near-IR color distribution evolves strongly, primarily due to a very
substantial increase with redshift in dust attenuation for massive galaxies.

gas-to-stellar mass ratios remains poorly understood. We investigate the nature
and fate of the "almost dark" cloud AGC 226178, projected within the Virgo
cluster, with an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~1000. We present deep single-dish
HI mapping from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST),
complemented by high-resolution interferometric data from the Very Large Array
(VLA), as part of the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID)
project. These observations provide the highest-quality HI analysis to date of
such a cloud, combining resolution and sensitivity. FAST data reveal a short,
low-velocity tail toward the dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, previously proposed as a
possible origin for AGC 226178. However, VCC 2034 shows a line-of-sight
asymmetric HI feature and cometary morphology indicating a stripping event
unrelated to AGC 226178. VLA data reveal a velocity gradient across AGC 226178
and a clumpy internal structure. The velocity dispersion exceeds the thermal
linewidth, implying turbulence or unresolved motions. The cloud cannot be
gravitationally bound by atomic gas alone. The resolved HI clumps follow
standard HI mass-star formation rate and mass-size relations, with those
forming stars reaching surface densities above the threshold for
self-shielding. We conclude that AGC 226178 is a free-floating HI cloud of
unknown origin. The system appears to be in the process of disintegration. It
is likely located well outside the Virgo cluster, as the preservation of its
extended HI morphology within the cluster environment would otherwise require a
substantial reservoir of unseen molecular gas with a mass exceeding that of the
observed HI content. While confinement pressure from the hot intracluster
medium may aid its stability, it is unlikely to be the dominant factor
preventing its disruption.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24002v1" target="_blank"><h2>Line-of-sight acceleration as a test of the Galactic Yukawa potential</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Felipe A. da Silva Barbosa, Luca Amendola, Davi C.

than 0.6 cm s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, we find that adopting a population of
$1.3 \times 10^5$ RR Lyrae stars as targets, a precision of $\sim$ 10 cm

satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an ideal site to observe the multi-phase
interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy across the electromagnetic spectrum. We
aim to exploit the available SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey data to study the
distribution, composition and properties of the diffuse X-ray emitting hot gas
in the LMC. We construct multi-band X-ray images of the LMC, reflecting the
morphology and temperatures of the diffuse hot gas. By performing spatially
resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 175 regions, we constrain the distribution,
physical state, and composition of the hot ISM phase throughout the LMC. We
combine our constraints with multiwavelength data to obtain a comprehensive
view of the different ISM phases.
  We measure a total X-ray luminosity of the hot ISM phase of
$1.9\times10^{38}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ ($0.2-5.0\,\mathrm{keV}$ band), and
constrain its thermal energy to around $5\times10^{54}\,\mathrm{erg}$. The
typical density and temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma are around
$5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $0.25\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively, with
both exhibiting broad peaks in the southeast of the LMC. The observed degree of
X-ray absorption correlates strongly with the distribution of foreground HI
gas, whereas a spatial anticorrelation between the hot and cold ISM phases is
visible on sub-kpc scales within the disk. The abundances of light metals show
a strong gradient throughout the LMC, with the north and east exhibiting a
strong $\alpha$-enhancement, as expected from observed massive stellar
populations there. In contrast, the enigmatic ``X-ray spur'' exhibits a local
deficit in $\alpha$-elements, and a peak in hot-gas pressure at
$P/k\sim10^5\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$, consistent with a dominant energy input
through tidally driven gas collisions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24030v1" target="_blank"><h2>Listening Across the Cosmic Time: Standard Sirens from Ground- and

the standard model for cosmology. Standard sirens, using the luminosity
distances measured by gravitational-wave observations of compact binary
mergers, are expected to provide such measurements independently in the next
decade. With the ground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories, the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA), different types of standard sirens altogether will place constraints
across a wide redshift range. In this paper, we forecast the precisions of
standard siren Hubble parameter measurements and compare various scenarios,
accounting for the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty. Specifically, we
find a $2\%$ constraint on $H_0$, a $1.5-3\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=1$,
and a $3-5\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=7$ when combining LVK and LISA
standard sirens with precise redshift measurements from electromagnetic
counterpart observations. We do not find a significant improvement when
including standard sirens with no EM counterpart, but which rely on features in
the black hole mass distribution, and the potential systematics introduced by
the possible redshift evolution of such features could further degrade the
measurement accuracy if not properly accounted for.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23096v1" target="_blank"><h2>The most massive star clusters in molecular clouds: Insights from the

provides unprecedented insights into the connection between individual
molecular clouds and their internal stellar populations in nearby galaxies. The
molecular clouds in five nearby galaxies were identified based on the
integrated intensity maps of CO (2$-$1) emission from ALMA observations. We
used the JWST 21 $\mu$m data to estimate the star formation rate (SFR) surface
density of the clouds and calculate the masses of the embedded stellar
populations in the clouds. After matching the star cluster and stellar
association catalogs derived from the HST observations with the identified
molecular clouds, we found clear correlations between the physical parameters
of molecular clouds and their internal stellar populations. Based on the masses
of the total stellar populations and their corresponding clouds, we obtained a
typical value of the cloud-scale star formation efficiency (SFE),
$\approx$1.4\%. The mass of the most massive cluster ($M_{\rm cluster, max}$)
in a cloud is positively proportional to the mass ($M_{\rm cloud}$), the column
density, the SFR sand the SFR surface density of the cloud. The observed
$M_{\rm cluster, max}$-$M_{\rm cloud}$ relation can be interpreted
theoretically on the basis of the integrated cloud-wide IMF (ICIMF) theory,
which provides a quantitative framework for understanding the correlations
between molecular clouds and their internal stellar populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23761v1" target="_blank"><h2>Macroscopic states in Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model with

Nazarenko</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages; 13 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a
self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are
studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide
range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike
interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low
amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable
state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum
fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are
corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy
NGC2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios.
Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced
partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain
range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC2366 lie
within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a
thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a
dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the
enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the
internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC2366's
dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its
total volume.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23269v1" target="_blank"><h2>BASIL: Fast broadband line-rich spectral-cube fitting and image

in hot cores and hot corinos is crucial for understanding the astrochemical
pathways and the inheritance of prebiotic material by nascent planetary
systems. However, the line-rich spectra from these sources pose significant
challenges for robustly fitting molecular parameters due to severe line
blending and unidentified lines. We present an efficient framework, Bayesian
Active Spectral-cube Inference and Learning (BASIL), for estimating molecular
parameter maps for hundreds of molecules based on the local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) model, applied to wideband spectral datacubes of line-rich
sources. We adopted stochastic variational inference to infer molecular
parameters from spectra at individual positions, balancing between fitting
accuracy and computational speed. For obtaining parameter maps, instead of
querying every location or pixel, we introduced an active learning framework
based on Bayesian quadrature and its parallelization. Specifically, we assessed
and selected the locations or pixels of spectrum that are most informative for
estimating the entire set of parameter maps by training a Gaussian processes
model. By greedily selecting locations with maximum information gain, we
achieve sublinear convergence. We benchmarked BASIL on a large synthetic
datacube and demonstrated that it produces accurate 468 molecular parameter
maps from 117 molecules within ~180 hours, orders of magnitude faster than
traditional pixel-by-pixel fitting using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, with
visually reliable results emerging in just ~20 hours. Additional training
iterations provide progressively more accurate results. This quick
visualization meets the demands of big data in modern astronomical surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23412v1" target="_blank"><h2>Uncover 3D Dark Matter Distribution of the Milky Way by an Empirical

orbit-superposition model, for the Milky Way halo. This model relies on minimal
physical assumptions that the system is stationary, meaning the distribution
function in 6D phase-space does not change when the stars orbiting in the
correct gravitational potential. We validate our method by applying it to mock
datasets that mimic the observations of the Milky Way halo from LAMOST + Gaia
with stars' 3D position and 3D velocity observed. By removing the stellar disk
and substructures, correcting the selection function, we obtain a sample of
smooth halo stars considered as stationary and complete. We construct a
gravitational potential including a highly flexible triaxial dark matter halo
with adaptable parameters. Within each specified gravitational potential, we
integrate orbits of these halo stars, and build a model by superposing the
orbits together taking the weights of stars derived from the selection function
correction. The goodness of the models are evaluated by comparing the density
distributions as well as 3D velocity distributions numerically represented in
the model to that in the data. The shape and radial density distribution of the
underlying dark matter halo can be constrained well simultaneously. We apply it
to three mock galaxies with different intrinsic shapes of their dark matter

($\Delta\chi^2 < 0$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM); (ii) In the neighborhood of

the maximum achievable $H_0 = 69.09\pm0.30$ ($\chi^2_{\rm BF} \approx

transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution
of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum
$\Pi$. It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this
approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll
phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second
transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\Pi$.
Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\Pi$ accurately captures the
dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\cal
R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\delta N$ formalism of
\cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of
$\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the
local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both
small and strictly constant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23659v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multiscale Turbulence Synthesis: Validation in 2D Hydrodynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pierre Lesaffre, Jean-Baptiste Durrive, Jean Goossaert, Susie Poirier, Stephane Colombi, Pablo Richard, Erwan Allys, William Bethune</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, physics.flu-dyn</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 19 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Numerical simulations can follow the evolution of fluid motions through the
intricacies of developed turbulence. However, they are rather costly to run,
especially in 3D. In the past two decades, generative models have emerged which
produce synthetic random flows at a computational cost equivalent to no more
than a few time-steps of a simulation. These simplified models qualitatively
bear some characteristics of turbulent flows in specific contexts
(incompressible 3D hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics), but generally
struggle with the synthesis of coherent structures. We aim at generating random
fields (e.g. velocity, density, magnetic fields, etc.) with realistic physical
properties for a large variety of governing partial differential equations and
at a small cost relative to time-resolved simulations. We propose a set of
approximations applied to given sets of partial differential equations, and
test the validity of our method in the simplest framework: 2D decaying
incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence. We compare results of 2D decaying
simulations with snapshots of our synthetic turbulence. We assess
quantitatively the difference first with standard statistical tools: power
spectra, increments and structure functions. These indicators can be reproduced
by our method during up to about a third of the turnover time scale. We also
consider recently developed scattering transforms statistics, able to
efficiently characterise non-Gaussian structures. This reveals more significant
discrepancy, which can however be bridged by bootstrapping. Finally, the number
of Fourier transforms necessary for one synthesis scales logarithmically in the
resolution, compared to linearly for time-resolved simulations. We have
designed a multiscale turbulence synthesis (MuScaTS) method to efficiently
short-circuit costly numerical simulations to produce realistic instantaneous
fields.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23317v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the origin of short-lived cocoon in 3C84: powered by tidal disruption

using the momentum balance along the jet axis and the transonic condition for
the cocoons observed at two different scales (approximately 1 and 6 parsec
scales). For the inner cocoon, we precisely determined the ratio of jet power
to ambient density $L_{\rm j}/n_{\rm a}$ to be $(0.3-0.7)\times 10^{43}\,{\rm
erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. Similarly, for the outer cocoon, we found that
this value is more than an order of magnitude larger at $(0.9-3.7)\times
10^{44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. This indicates that the outer
cocoon is formed by a powerful jet that propagates through an ambient density
of $20-300\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a jet power of $10^{45-46.5}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm
s}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the inner cocoon is formed by a weaker jet with a
power of $10^{43-44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, propagating through a
relatively low-density environment of $6-20\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$. These results
suggest that: 1) with respect to the difference in $n_{\rm a}$, it appears to
support the hypothesis that the inner cocoon, recently formed about 10 years
ago, is expanding in the low-density cocoon created by the jet emitted about
25-50 years ago. 2) to achieve the short-lived and high $L_{\rm j}$ that
generated the outer cocoon, a large mass accretion rate must be required over a
short period to activate the jet. These may imply the extreme accretion event
driven by the tidal disruption events (TDEs) of massive stars and/or the disk
instability.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23752v1" target="_blank"><h2>Significance of soft-scale breaking on primordial black hole production

Universe, potentially leading to the formation of primordial black holes
(PBHs), which can also be a dark matter candidate. In this work, we focus on
the supercooling phase transition for the scale symmetry breaking based on the
effective potential of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type. We investigate the
effect on the PBH production in the presence of an additional mass term for the
CW scalar field, what we call a soft-scale breaking term, which serves as the
extra explicit-scale breaking term other than the quantum scale anomaly induced
by the CW mechanism. We demonstrate that even a small size of the soft-scale
breaking term can significantly affect the PBH production depending on its
sign: a positive term slows down the phase transition, thereby enhancing the
PBH abundance and improving the model's ability to account for dark matter; in
contrast, a negative term suppresses the PBH formation. The inclusion of such
soft-scale breaking terms broadens the viable parameter space and increases the
flexibility of the framework. We further illustrate our results through two
ultraviolet-complete realizations: i) a many-flavor QCD-inspired model as a
reference model which can dynamically induce a positive-soft scale breaking;
ii) a Higgs portal model with a $B-L$ scalar as the benchmark for the case
where a negative-soft scale breaking is induced. Our study would provide a new
