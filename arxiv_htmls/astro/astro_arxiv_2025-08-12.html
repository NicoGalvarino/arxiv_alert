of warm ionized gas in six powerful radio galaxies at z=3.5-4, using
JWST/NIRSpec IFU to quantify jet-driven feedback in the early universe. All
sources exhibit broad [OIII] emission-line profiles with W80 (line width)
values of 950-2500 km/s across $\sim$10s of kpc, signifying large-scale
outflows. The outflowing nebulae are preferentially aligned with the radio jet
axis, suggesting jet-driven origin. On average, the regions with the broadest
lines and highest velocities are co-spatial with radio lobes or cores, and
exhibit the strongest kinetic power. Ionized gas masses associated with the
outflows span 1 to 8 $\times 10^{9} \ M_\odot$, with total mass outflow rates
of 80-950 Msun/yr and kinetic powers between 10^{43.2} and 10^{45.0} erg/s. The
outflow kinetic power corresponds to 0.15%-2% of the AGN bolometric luminosity,
sufficient to impact galaxy evolution. However, only $\lesssim 1$\% of the jet
mechanical energy couples to the warm ionized gas via outflows, consistent with
predictions from hydrodynamic simulations. A large fraction of the jet energy
may instead reside in shock-heated hot gas, supported by X-ray detection, or
used to thermalize the gas and produce the observed emission-line nebulae. Our
results demonstrate that radio jets in massive, gas-rich systems at
high-redshift can inject significant kinetic and thermal energy to the
surroundings, providing direct evidence for jet-driven feedback operating
during the peak epoch of galaxy formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07311v1" target="_blank"><h2>The 4MOST-Cosmology Redshift Survey: Target Selection of Bright Galaxies

Telescope (4MOST-CRS) will provide redshift measurements of galaxies and
quasars over 5700{\degsq} in the southern hemisphere. As targets for the
4MOST-CRS, we present a selection of an $r<19.25$ magnitude limited sample of
Bright Galaxies (BG) and a colour selected sample of Luminous Red Galaxies
(LRG) based on DESI Legacy Survey DR10.1 photometric data, in the redshift
ranges $0.1<z<0.5$ and $0.4<z<1$, respectively. These samples are selected
using the $g$, $r$, $z$, and $W1$ (from unWISE) photometric bands. For BGs, the
star--galaxy separation is performed based on Gaia and Tycho-2 star catalogues.
Following 4MOST requirements, the target densities of BGs and LRGs are
250{\mdegsq} and 400{\mdegsq}, respectively. We quantified the stellar
contamination to be $<2-4\%$ for both galaxy samples using data from the first
DESI data release. Using angular clustering, we show that both samples are
robust against imaging systematics, confirming a low stellar contamination.
Finally, we provide forecasts of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and
growth of structure ($\sigma_8$) measurements from the 4MOST-CRS alone and in
combination with DESI. From the 4MOST-CRS, we expect 3\% and 25\% precision on
BAO and $\sigma_8$ measurements, respectively. Combining 4MOST-CRS with DESI
improves the constraints from DESI alone by 12$\%$ in the 0.4 < z < 0.8
redshift range, leading to the most stringent constraints on BAO measurements
from spectroscopic galaxy clustering.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06608v1" target="_blank"><h2>Second public data release of the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in

identified in SDSS DR10 observations ($z < 0.05$) and the IllustrisTNG300-1
$\Lambda$CDM simulation ($z = 0$), utilizing the novel GrAviPaSt
filament-finder method. The analyses are performed on both macro- and
micro-filaments, each characterized by their length, thickness, and contrast in
mass density. In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of
micro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters),
are introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\Lambda$CDM model

structures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher
densities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable
density discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments
are significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density
profiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit
higher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their
observational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced
density contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data
showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, SDSS galaxies in both GG and CC
micro-filaments exhibit lower specific star formation rates (sSFR) and older
stellar populations, while TNG300-1 micro-filaments host more actively
star-forming galaxies within the intermediate stellar mass range. These results
reveal persistent discrepancies between observational data and the $\Lambda$CDM

  N-body Simulations: Testing Numerical Convergence and Correction Methods</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kun Xu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 15 figures. To be submitted to JCAP after my vacation</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and
galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized
regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to
achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are
strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for
the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two
$6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass
resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and
Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified
by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF)
converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but
can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according
to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models.
Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and
velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of
$0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to
cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation.
Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires
more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that
redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales
because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} <
0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$
in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for
redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures
that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based
studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06607v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST+ALMA reveal the ISM kinematics and stellar structure of MAMBO-9, a

JWST/NIRCam+MIRI imaging of MAMBO-9, a pair of optically-dark, dusty
star-forming galaxies at $z=5.85$. MAMBO-9 is among the most massive, gas-rich,
and actively star-forming galaxies at this epoch, when the Universe was less
than 1 Gyr old. The new, 400 pc-resolution [CII] observations reveal velocity
gradients in both objects; we estimate dynamical masses and find a relative
mass ratio of 1:5. The kinematics of both objects suggest both rotation and
strong tidal interaction, suggesting that the pair has already experienced a
close encounter. Indeed, the new JWST imaging reveals a continuous bridge of
moderately dust-obscured material between the two. We perform
spatially-resolved SED fitting using the high-resolution ALMA+JWST imaging,
finding that the majority of recent star-formation is concentrated in extremely
obscured ($A_V > 10$) clouds, while the majority of rest-optical light (stellar
continuum and H$\alpha$ emission) is emergent from moderate-to-highly obscured
($A_V\sim 1$-$5$) regions on the outskirts. Combining our new stellar and
dynamical mass measurements with previous CO observations, we find that the
mass budget of MAMBO-9 requires a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm
CO}$) of roughly unity, indicative of a highly metal-enriched ISM. Finally, we
show that MAMBO-9 resides in a large overdensity spanning the PRIMER-COSMOS
field, with 39 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed within $\sim 25$ cMpc. With
a total baryonic mass $\sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, MAMBO-9 can be considered a
prototype of massive galaxy formation and likely progenitor of the brightest
cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the lower-redshift Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08037v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reionization in Protocluster Environments at $z>7$ with JWST/NIRSpec</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Qiong Li, Christopher J.

is essential to unveiling the early stages of structure formation. Using deep
imaging and spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES Deep
Survey in GOODS-South, we identify two prominent protoclusters at z>7 and
investigate their environmental properties in comparison to field galaxies.
Protocluster members exhibit systematically higher ionizing photon production
efficiency ($\xi_{\text{ion}}$) and inflated [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios at fixed UV
magnitude or stellar mass, likely driven by young, metal-poor stellar
populations and intense star formation. Despite these properties, their
Ly$\alpha$ emission is weak or absent, and they show high proximate neutral
hydrogen column densities, suggesting insufficient ionizing output to maintain
ionized bubbles. We also find that a strong Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE),
JADES-GS-z7-LA, may lie within the same ionized region as one protocluster.
Although their Lyman continuum escape fractions ($f_{\mathrm{esc}} \sim 0.1$)
are comparable to those of LAEs, individual protocluster galaxies are faint
($M_{\mathrm{UV}} > -19$) and low-mass ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) \sim 8.5$). The
enhanced number density within protoclusters boosts the local UV luminosity
density by nearly 1 dex. The surrounding gas remains largely neutral,
suggesting that reionization was highly patchy and modulated by environment.
The protocluster galaxies likely host ionization-bounded nebulae with holes,
suppressing Ly$\alpha$ visibility, in contrast to field galaxies that are more
consistent with density-bounded nebulae.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06896v1" target="_blank"><h2>Properties of cluster red-sequence spiral galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wayne A.

CFHT+MegaCam in u- and r-band, KPNO 0.9-meter 2TkA and MOSAIC 8K camera in B
and Rc, and images and catalogs extracted from the WINGS survey.
Multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy were obtained by cross-matching
sources with SDSS, GALEX, and WISE datasets. Our main results suggest that up
to 45% of optically red spirals are dusty compared to blue spiral galaxies
based on infrared observations. The presence of dust can obscure star formation
and hence lead to red spirals being misclassified as passive systems.
Approximately half of the red spirals do not show evidence of a large abundance
of dust, hence are optically red due to passive evolution. Support for the
passive nature of these red spirals is provided by SDSS emission line data
based on the Dn(4000) spectral index, EW(H-alpha), EW(H-delta), and [O III]
5007 A luminosity, and on a comparison of the star formation rate and the
specific star formation rate with cluster blue spirals. Red spirals are an
important link in the evolution of galaxies in the high-density cluster
environment and play a key role in determining the physical mechanisms that are
responsible for transforming blue star-forming galaxies into red spiral
systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07589v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cluster passage driving galaxy kinematic and structural evolution in the

We
study the impact that passage through a cluster has on stellar and ionised gas
kinematics for galaxies within the Sydney-AAO Multi Integral field (SAMI)
Galaxy Survey. We compute the kinematic asymmetry $v_{\rm asym}$ in the
line-of-sight stellar and ionsied gas velocity maps to quantify how the cluster
environment disturbs the kinematics of the stars and ionised gas. We find a
significantly higher fraction of galaxies with elevated gas asymmetries in
clusters compared to non-cluster environments (17$^{+2}_{-3}$\%, 26/154 vs.
11$^{+1}_{-1}$\%, 72/751), with these galaxies most likely being recent
infallers passage based on their position in projected-phase-space. Compared to
cluster galaxies without elevated gas asymmetries, cluster galaxies with
elevated gas asymmetries have, on average, more centrally concentrated
star-formation. Finally, we find the highest fraction of galaxies with elevated
gas asymmetries in clusters likely to host significant substructure or be
dynamically complex. Our findings are consistent with the scenario of galaxies
falling into clusters, either individually or in groups, and undergoing
disk-fading and a redistribution of gas, due to ram pressure stripping
experienced during pericentre passage.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07688v1" target="_blank"><h2>No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shotaro Yamasaki, Tetsuya Hashimoto, Haruka Kusakabe, Tomotsugu Goto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio
transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer
clues to constrain progenitor models. Among various host properties, gas-phase
metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of
transients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host
galaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40
hosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited
subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate
(SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in
the same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range
in metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted
mass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to
the earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on
metallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB
production. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity,
high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter
distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal
($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from
the fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed
mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that
observed in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase
following galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the
starburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed
delay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over
core-collapse supernovae.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07930v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deep imaging of the galaxy Malin 2 shows new faint structures and a

exceptionally large sizes and low stellar densities. Their formation and
evolution remain poorly constrained due to the challenges of detecting their
faint disks. We present deep, multi-band optical imaging of Malin 2, a
prototypical GLSB galaxy, with the newly commissioned Two-meter Twin Telescope
(TTT) at the Teide Observatory. Our $g$, $r$, and $i$-band data reach surface
brightness depths of 30.3, 29.5, and 28.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (3$\sigma$,
$10^{\prime\prime} \times 10^{\prime\prime}$), tracing the stellar disk of
Malin 2 to $\sim$110 kpc. We detect new diffuse structures, including a
prominent emission in the northwest coincident with the HI distribution, and a
faint spiral arm-like feature in the southeast. We also identify a very faint
dwarf galaxy, TTT-d1 ($\mu_{0,g} \sim 26$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$), about 130 kpc
southeast of Malin 2, possibly its first known satellite ultra-diffuse galaxy.
A multi-directional wedge photometric analysis of Malin 2 shows strong
azimuthal variations in its stellar disk. Compared with nearby spirals and
other GLSBs, Malin 2 lies at the extreme end in radial extent and stellar mass
surface density. The overlap between the asymmetric stellar emission and a
lopsided HI distribution suggests contributions from tidal interactions in the
formation of the giant disk of Malin 2. Our results highlight the importance of
ultra-deep, wide-field imaging in understanding the structural complexity of
giant LSB galaxies. Upcoming surveys such as LSST will be crucial to determine
whether the features we observe in Malin 2 are common to other giant LSB disk
galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06610v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the Origins of Optical Variability in AGNs: Correlations with

(AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN catalogue by utilising
approximately five years of optical light curves from the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) survey. We investigate dependencies of the long-term optical
variability amplitudes and timescales on (i) supermassive black hole (SMBH)
mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio to explore the influence of accretion
disk dynamics and radiative processes; (ii) X-ray properties, such as spectral
photon indices and fluxes, to study the effect of high-energy emission
mechanisms; and (iii) radio characteristics, such as integrated fluxes and
radio loudness, which indicate jet activity. Our findings confirm a positive
correlation between the variability time scale and both the SMBH mass and
luminosity, suggesting that these physical parameters significantly impact the
optical variability timescale. Conversely, no significant dependence is found
between optical variability and X-ray properties, indicating that high-energy
processes may not substantially influence long-term optical variability.
Additionally, a weak anti-correlation between optical variability and radio
parameters suggests that jet activity has a negligible effect on causing
long-term AGN variability. These results support the hypothesis that long-term
optical variability in AGN is primarily governed by thermal emission from the
accretion disk. Further investigations with larger samples are essential to
refine these correlations and develop robust physical models integrating black
hole properties, accretion disk physics, and multi-wavelength radiative
transfer.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07828v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Blooming Tree Algorithm at Work: Clusters, Filaments and

algorithm effectively identifies all the X-ray luminous clusters and most of
the optical clusters known in the literature, numerous groups, and the
filaments surrounding the clusters, associating a list of galaxy members to
each structure. By lowering the detection threshold, the BT algorithm also
identifies the three superclusters in the field. The BT algorithm arranges the
clusters and groups that make up the superclusters in a hierarchical tree
according to their pairwise binding energy: the algorithm thus unveils the
possible accretion history of each supercluster and their future evolution.
These results show how the BT algorithm can represent a crucial tool to

Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by
combining Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data and DESI DR2 baryon

between the two datasets, we develop a new method called Neural Kernel Gaussian
Process Regression (NKGPR), which uses two neural networks to simultaneously
learn the mean and kernel functions of a Gaussian process. This approach
improves upon traditional Gaussian process regression by mitigating trend
mismatches and removing the need for manual kernel selection. We investigate
possible deviations from the CDDR by adopting three parameterizations of the
deviation function and constrain the model-independent parameter $\eta_0$

  and Their Observational Implications</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Farshad Kamalinejad, Zachary Slepian</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an analytical expression that gives both the matter and tracer
(halo or galaxy) power spectrum with 1-loop corrections that include the
neutrino effects on the mode coupling kernels. We use the FFTLog algorithm to
accelerate calculating the higher-order corrections to the power spectrum. We
then use our power spectrum and bispectrum models to pursue two main goals.
First, we examine the impact of neutrino mass on cosmological parameter
estimation from both the power spectrum and bispectrum in real space. We create
1-loop power spectrum and bispectrum templates in real-space and fit to the
\texttt{Quijote} simulation suite, including the cross-covariance between the
power spectrum and the bispectrum. We show the neutrino signature kernels
estimate the same cosmological parameters as the model with the SPT (Standard
Perturbation Theory) kernels, even for DESI Year 5 volume, except for the
galaxy bias parameters inferred from the bispectrum. Second, we investigate to
what extent the bispectrum can improve parameter constraints. We perform a
Fisher forecast using the power spectrum, the tree-level bispectrum, and a
joint analysis that includes the cross-covariance between them. We show that
including the bispectrum can substantially reduce the error bars on key
parameters. For the neutrino mass in particular, the uncertainty is reduced by
$\sim 20\%$</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07381v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rescattering of non-minimal coupling scalar particles during inflation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhe Yu, Xunliang Yang, Yungui Gong</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the rescattering effects arising from non-minimally coupled
scalar particles $\chi$ that are suddenly produced during inflation. The
coupling term $\xi R \chi^2$ significantly enhances resonant particle
production compared to minimal coupling scenarios. Consequently, the produced
$\chi$ particles rescattering off the homogeneous inflaton condensate $\phi$,
generating abundant $\delta\phi$ quanta within very short time intervals. This
process leads to characteristic enhancements in the power spectrum of
primordial curvature perturbations at scales corresponding to the moments of
particle production. When this occurs at small scales, the power spectrum
amplitude can reach as high as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. Furthermore, analysis of
the equilateral bispectrum shows that this mechanism also induces substantial
non-Gaussian features.</p></br></body>
