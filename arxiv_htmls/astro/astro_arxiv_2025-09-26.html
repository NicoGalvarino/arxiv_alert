conditions of outflowing gas. Here, we use simulations of isolated disk
galaxies ranging from dwarf mass ($M_{200} = 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) to
Milky Way mass ($M_{200} = 10^{12}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), based on the FIRE-2
subgrid models to investigate multiphase galactic outflows. We use the CHIMES
non-equilibrium chemistry module to create synthetic spectra of common outflow
tracers ([CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$, $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, H$\alpha$ and
$[\mathrm{OIII}]_{5007\text{A}}$). Using our synthetic spectra we measure the
mass outflow rate, kinetic power and momentum flux using observational
techniques. In [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ we measure outflow rates of $10^{-4}$ to
$1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ across an SFR range of $10^{-3}$ to $1$
$\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is in reasonable agreement with
observations. The significant discrepancy is in $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, with
the simulations lying $\approx1$ dex below the observational sample. We test
observational assumptions used to derive outflow properties from synthetic
spectra. We find the greatest uncertainty lies in measurements of electron
density, as estimates using the SII doublet can overestimate the actual
electron density by up to 2 dex, which changes mass outflow rates by up to 4
dex. We also find that molecular outflows are especially sensitive to the
conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass, with outflow rates
changing by up to 4 dex in our least massive galaxy. Comparing the outflow
properties derived from the synthetic spectra to those derived directly from
the simulation, we find that [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ probes outflows at greater
distances from the disk, whilst we find that molecular gas does not survive at
large distances within outflows within our modestly star-forming disk galaxies
simulated in this work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20716v1" target="_blank"><h2>Episodic Feedback in Triple AGN Candidate SDSS J0849+1114 Revealed by

galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN feedback can reshape the host galaxy and
regulate both star formation and super-massive black-hole (SMBH) accretion.
Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy, we conduct a spatially resolved
study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114. Extended ionized gas
structures ($>10$ kpc from nucleus A) primarily associated with tidal tails are
detected. Meanwhile, two distinct ionized gas outflows are revealed. One
extends over $>5$ kpc around nuclei A with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm
out,A} = 3.0\times10^{42}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$, which might be driven by the
radio jet. The other outflow extends $\sim 5.9$ kpc around nucleus C, with a
kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,C} = 2.0\times10^{40}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$.
High [O III]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tidal gas require
that nucleus A radiated at a high accretion rate with $L_{\rm A,bol} \sim
0.1$--$0.5\,L_{\rm Edd,A}$ at least $\sim3$--$\times10^{4}\rm\,yr$ ago,
$20$--$100$ times brighter than today. Combined with multi-wavelength
constraints, we find evidence for episodic AGN feedback that expelled
circumnuclear gas and rapidly quenched accretion. This triple AGN candidate
demonstrates how AGN feedback can self-regulate black hole growth and impact
hosts during mergers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20452v1" target="_blank"><h2>A GLIMPSE of Intermediate Mass Black holes in the epoch of reionization:

Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these
populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies
surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the
strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the
[OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components
and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of
ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5 < z < 7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred
BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime
down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a
galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down
to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical
$M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the
black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While
we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm
BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim
10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the
extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models
suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the
direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse
of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive
BHs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20832v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic Contrail in NGC 3627 caused by Dwarf Galaxy Candidate or

galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of
200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust
emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size
significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and
exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are
consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6
M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the
disk at >300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its
width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent
interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black
hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of
massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20548v1" target="_blank"><h2>Under the glare of a luminous quasar, the FIR continuum is still an

in quasar host galaxies, particularly based on the far-infrared, offer insights
into the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution. Motivated by
predictions of quasar heating of dust on both nuclear and galaxy-wide scales,
we perform two-component (host galaxy + point source) modeling of
high-resolution (~0.1") ALMA observations of the FIR continuum in Band 5
(lambda_rest~500 um) of three highly luminous quasars (L_bol~10^47 erg/s),
powered by supermassive black holes having M_BH~10^9 M_sun, at z=2. We include
Band 9 (lambda_rest~154 um; 0.06" and 0.3") data at high S/N which places
further constraints on the unresolved nuclear component in two cases. To break
the degeneracy between quasar and stellar heating, we use CO (J=5-4), observed
in Band 5, to gauge the expected contribution of star formation to the infrared
luminosity. We find very good agreement between the strength and spatial
distribution of the extended continuum component and its prediction based on CO
(J=5-4). This is supported by the location of our three quasars along the L_(CO
5-4)-L_(IR, SFR) luminosity relation for inactive star-forming galaxies. As a
consequence, there is no evidence for additional continuum emission on extended
scales which could be attributed to quasar-heated dust. As expected, the
nuclear (i.e., torus) contribution is present and subdominant (12% in Band 9
for one quasar with a typical star-forming host) or non-existent (< 8% in Band 9
for the starbursting host). Based on the continuum and CO, the presence of
substantial levels of ongoing star formation agrees with previous estimates
from unresolved ALMA continuum observations which finds SFRs consistent with
star-forming main-sequence galaxies. Therefore, our results do not provide
evidence for a quasar-mode feedback, even for the most luminous cases at z=2.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20434v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dwarf galaxy halo masses from spectroscopic and photometric lensing in

dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the
first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar
masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing
signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$
up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})<$9.25) -- opening up a
new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES
photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of
over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies
with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to
$\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales
$\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample
selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in
the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results
demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and
that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave
the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics
with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20430v1" target="_blank"><h2>pop-cosmos: Star formation over 12 Gyr from generative modelling of a

trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $ < 26$).
The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based
diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star
formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual
galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent
(Q) galaxies using specific SFR $ < 10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$
colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent
fractions across $0 < z < 3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by
galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass
function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($ < 10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$)
Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase.
Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct
patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback
time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star
formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$)
during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier
star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive
($10<\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot}) < 11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$
Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN
activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$)
galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states,
declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that
AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching
transition.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21299v1" target="_blank"><h2>Outflow-cloud interaction as the possible origin of the peculiar radio

dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results
from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh
extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact
radio emission, unresolved at a scale of <~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high
brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~> 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral
energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak
flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition
analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region
over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The
radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting
for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard
shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if
dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is
supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow
with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This
work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining
the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those
occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20458v1" target="_blank"><h2>A DECADE of dwarfs: first detection of weak lensing around

spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies, using the large overlap between
DESI DR1 spectroscopic data and DECADE/DES weak lensing catalogs. A clean dwarf
galaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess
surface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\log
\rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\odot$ and $\log \rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\odot$), with
signal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise
drops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying
individual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber
incompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against
variations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing
calibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with
stellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation
and find a satellite fraction of $\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous
photometric studies but $1.5\sigma$ lower than $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We
find that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can
change the inferred $f_{\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need
for accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our
results open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low

galaxy previously reported to host a broad H$\alpha$ emission line. The diffuse
soft X-ray emission ($<$3 keV) extends out to $\sim$800 pc, while harder
emission ($>$3 keV) is confined to the central $\sim$400 pc. Spatially resolved
spectroscopy of the nuclear ($r < 150$ pc) and extended ($150 < r < 500$ pc) regions
reveals that these are best described by models including both photoionized and
thermal plasma components, consistent with excitation by a low-luminosity AGN
and shock-heated gas. Narrow-band imaging and excitation maps from the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) support this interpretation, closely matching the X-ray
morphology and ionization structure. The detection of a faint hard X-ray
nuclear source with Chandra, combined with stringent upper limits from NuSTAR
and Swift, and consistency with the X-ray luminosity predicted from the HST [O

low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$), unobscured AGN.
Despite the extremely low Eddington ratio inferred from our measurements
($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$), the presence of a broad H$\alpha$
line in the optical spectrum suggests the persistence of a thin accretion disk,
challenging standard paradigms of accretion flow configurations at such low

in each spectrum, and the two lower-$J$ lines are highly saturated at velocity
centers of the two most prominent components. The effect of uncertainty in the
continuum covering factor was carefully assessed using a Monte Carlo approach.
We also accounted for systematic uncertainties in the HCN $J$=4-3 and $J$=5-4
absorption due to time variability during an intense flaring event of the
quasar. Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and neglecting molecular
collisions, we derived the excitation temperature profiles and their
uncertainties in the optically thin regime. We determined the cosmic microwave
background radiation temperature at $z = 0.89$ to be
${5.13\pm0.06\,\mathrm{K}}$ by taking a weighted average of calculated

population down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$ using three metrics:
the stellar mass function (SMF) as function of environment, the stellar-to-halo
mass relation (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies inferred via abundance matching, and the
quenched fraction of highly isolated dwarfs. We find that the low-mass SMF
shape shows minimal environmental dependence, with the field dwarf SMF
described by a low-mass power-law index of $\alpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$ down to $\rm
M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$, and that the quenched fraction of isolated
dwarfs drops monotonically to $f_{q} \sim 10^{-3}$ at $\rm M_\star \sim \rm

measures, our inferred SHMR agrees with literature measurements of satellite
systems, consistent with minimal environmental dependence of the SHMR in the

against which we compare accurately predict the \sagalocal{} SHMR, we find that
big-box cosmological simulations largely over-predict isolated galaxy quenched
fractions via a turnaround in $f_q(\rm M_\star)$ at $\rm 10^8\lesssim

the drivers of galaxy formation and the need for systematic multidimensional
