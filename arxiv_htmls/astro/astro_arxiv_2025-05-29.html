Ho</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and
red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for
significant dust extinction of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag. However, the dust-reddened
AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared
emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is
either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust
extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various
extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing
the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI,
Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly
constrained to $A_V \lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A_V \lesssim 1.5$
mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker
constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$
values yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\%$ for the LRD population, easing
the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower
redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with
reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories,
provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and
evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22567v1" target="_blank"><h2>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big

first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar
properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the
properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of
several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes,
which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity
measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift
7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the
[OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an
extremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such
properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early
cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has
developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models
assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or
super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations,
although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases.
Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed
shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment
associated with this black hole.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22161v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectral indices in active galactic nuclei as seen by Apertif and LOFAR</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

The images, produced with a direction-dependent calibration pipeline, cover 136
square degrees of the Lockman Hole and 24 square degrees of the ELAIS-N fields,
with an average resolution of 17x12" and residual noise of 33 uJy/beam. With
the improved depth of the images we found in total 63692 radio sources, many of
which are detected for the first time at this frequency. With the addition of
the previously published Apertif catalog for the Bootes field, we cross-match
with the LOFAR deep-fields value-added catalogs at 150 MHz, resulting in a
homogeneous sample of 10196 common sources with spectral index estimates, one
of the largest to date. We analyze and discuss the correlations between
spectral index, redshift, linear sources size, and radio luminosity, taking
into account biases of flux-density-limited surveys. Our results suggest that
the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift of active galactic
nuclei can be attributed to the Malmquist bias reflecting an intrinsic relation
between radio luminosity and the spectral index. We also find a correlation
between spectral index and linear source size with more compact sources having
steeper spectra.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22216v1" target="_blank"><h2>Diverse reddening distributions in sight lines to type Ia supernovae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lucas Hallgren, Radoslaw Wojtak, Jens Hjorth, Charles L. Steinhardt</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A; 12 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately
accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is
challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from
host-galaxy interstellar reddening.The latter is commonly modelled in a
probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a
universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies.
We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against
predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in
host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences
between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies,
primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated
reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia
supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host
galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with
vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the
difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the
distribution may peak at E(B-V)>0 when considering a population of young type
Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We
demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling
peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives
rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also
bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different
host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in
average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened
supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust
expected in these galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22242v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron
  density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jens Chluba, Geoffrey Vasil, Richard Battye</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 18 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron
density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at
last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic
variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations
using Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which
can be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new
effects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to
the Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron
fluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of
the visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing
of the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective
scattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer
functions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM
but can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure
formation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested
by a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies
observed by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble
tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple
modifications to the average recombination history arise. This highlights how
important an understanding of the recombination process is in cosmological
inference, and that a coordinated simulation and analysis campaign is required
as part of the search for the origin of the various tensions in cosmology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22082v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Superclusters and Their Complexes in the Cosmic Web</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Maret Einasto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 50 pages, 22 figures, Universe, 2025, 11, 167</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The richest and largest structures in the cosmic web are galaxy
superclusters, their complexes (associations of several almost connected very
rich superclusters), and planes. Superclusters represent a special environment
where the evolution of galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters differs from the
evolution of these systems in a low-density environment. The richest galaxy
clusters reside in superclusters. The richest superclusters in the nearby
Universe form a quasiregular pattern with the characteristic distance between
superclusters 120 - 140 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Moreover, superclusters in the nearby
Universe lie in two huge perpendicular planes with the extent of several
hundreds of megaparsecs, the Local Supercluster plane and the Dominant
supercluster plane. The origin of these patterns in the supercluster
distribution is not yet clear, and it is an open question whether the presence
of such structures can be explained within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.
This review presents a brief story of superclusters, their discovery,

Driver</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages, 14 figures, Accepted - MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In part I of this series we discussed the variation of star-formation
histories (SFHs) across the specific star formation rate - stellar mass plane
(sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS).
Here we explore the physical mechanisms that are likely driving these
observational trends, by comparing the properties of galaxies with common
recent SFH shapes. Overall, we find that the processes shaping the movement of
galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane can be be largely split into two
stellar mass regimes, bounded by the minimum SFR dispersion ($\sigma_{SFR}$)
point. At lower stellar masses we find that large $\sigma_{SFR}$ values are
likely observed due to a combination of stochastic star-formation processes and
a large variety in absolute sSFR values, but relatively constant/flat SFHs.
While at higher stellar masses we see strong observational evidence that Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are associated with rapidly declining SFHs, and that
these galaxies reside in the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ region of the plane. As such,
we suggest that AGN feedback, leading to galaxy quenching, is the primary
driver of the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ values. These results are consistent with
previous theoretical interpretations of the $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$
relation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21983v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing Galaxy Evolution in infalling galaxies of Abell 496: From

Acosta-Espinoza</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> During the fall of late-type galaxies into clusters, they can experiment a
variety of evolutionary mechanisms according their local environment.
Consequently, studying the UV emission and the cold gas of late-type galaxies
provide key insights in the evolution of short-lived starburst and galaxy
quenching. In this work, we conduted a study of two 28' fields observed with
UVIT-AstroSat in the central region of the Abell cluster A496 ($z=0.033$),
including HI, data from NRAO VLA. We reported 22 cluster members detected in
FUV; all of them are detected in HI, or have upper limits for the HI-mass. We
find our FUV detected galaxies generally have higher specific star formation
rates than other star forming galaxies. Most of the FUV galaxies with masses
above 10$^9 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$,and showing high sSFR have no close neighbors,
pointing at RPS as the dominant mechanism affecting them. In contrast, most of
the low-mass FUV objects present at least one companion, suggesting that tidal
interactions also play an important role in the triggering of infalling
galaxies. Combining the FUV-SFR with the HI properties of the observed galaxies
in A496 we identify an evolutionary sequence consisting of five stages: (1)
Pre-triggering, (2) Initial SF-triggering, (3) Peak of star-formation, (4)
SF-fading, and (5) SF-quenching. During this path, normal gas-rich objects
reach a gas-deficiency phase with SFR well below the main sequence. This
process, prior to becoming a full passive galaxy, can be accomplished within a
few 10$^{8}$ yr.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21980v1" target="_blank"><h2>Understanding gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hilay Shah, Freeke van de Voort, Amit Seta, Christoph Federrath</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 16 figures, submitted to MNRAS, under review</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study gas mixing in a simulated Milky Way-mass galaxy's circumgalactic
medium (CGM) using cosmological zoom-in simulations. We insert tracer dyes in
the CGM with different gas flows (shearing, coherent, and static) and diverse
physical properties to track gas mixing and find that shearing flows generally
exhibit a higher dye spread. We then correlate the extent and shape of dye
spread with local gas properties for a generalised understanding of gas mixing.
The velocity dispersion and magnitude of traceless symmetric shear (shear
deformation) tensors in small regions (<5 kpc) around the dye injection
locations most accurately predict the extent of dye spread after 200 Myr
(Spearman rank 0.87). We use this to determine diffusivity calibration
constants for subgrid-scale mixing models. While the dye shape after 200 Myr
aligns well with velocity and magnetic field dispersion, the best alignment
occurs with the dispersion of eigenvectors representing stretching (from
traceless symmetric shear tensor) and plane-of-rotation (from antisymmetric
shear or vorticity tensor) in large regions (>10 kpc) around the dye injection
locations. Therefore, shear-related statistics and velocity dispersion are the
properties best able to predict both the extent and shape of mixed gas in our
simulations. Our dyes spread roughly linearly with time, suggesting
superdiffusive behaviour in the CGM, potentially due to turbulent and
large-scale coherent flows. We calculate physical Reynolds numbers of 10^2-10^3
using gas properties in the CGM of our simulations, which a resolution of a few
hundred pc could resolve, but our 1 kpc resolution leads to significant
numerical mixing. However, our correlation results are robust to changes in
resolution. These results can be used to predict diffusion coefficients from
local gas properties to model processes like magnetic field diffusion, heat
transport, and metal mixing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22285v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sub-arcsecond-resolution LOFAR observations of bright sub-millimetre

Vitello</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 11 pages, 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Bright SMGs contribute significantly to the star formation rate (SFR) density
(20-50\%) and stellar mass density ($\sim$ 30-50\%) at $z=$ 2-4 with SFRs$\ge
1000$ M$_\odot$,yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$-$10^{12}$
M$_\odot$. The number of bright SMGs with such high SFRs is hard to reconcile
with the standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper we
provide evidence that, in a small sample of 12 bright SMGs, the SFRs derived
from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting are significantly higher than
those obtained using low-frequency radio emission as a proxy for star
formation. Using the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT), which allows imaging
at 144 MHz with sub-arcsecond angular resolution, we have produced deep images
of a small sample of bright SMGs in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field
extracted from the NEPSC2 survey. For all 12 SMGs, we find radio-emitting
mid-infrared galaxies at distances from a few arcseconds down to sub-arcsecond
scales from the SMG and/or the presence of a radio-emitting AGN. The SFRs
derived from the radio emission of the SMG, disentangled from the AGN-related
radio emission, are systematically lower by a factor of $\sim 5$ (median value)
than those derived from the multi-band SED fitting. We discuss whether our
assumptions might be, at least in part, responsible for the observed
discrepancy. We argue that the radio-derived SFRs are not systematically
underestimated but can be affected by a significant dispersion ($0.3-0.5$ dex).
Considering these new SFR estimates, the offset of the specific SFR of the 12
bright SMGs from the star-forming galaxy main sequence
($\Delta\mathrm{(SSFR)}$) is significantly reduced, with all 12 bright SMGs
which are only a factor of 2 more star-forming than the main sequence galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21929v1" target="_blank"><h2>MWA and VLA Observations of Diffuse Radio Lobes in M 87</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Linhui Wu, Fu-Guo Xie, Qian Zheng, Quan Guo, Huanyuan Shan, Dan Hu, Stefan W.

diffuse radio lobes surrounding the giant elliptical galaxy M\,87, utilizing
well-sampled wideband ($\rm 60\,MHz-10.55\,GHz$) observations from MWA and VLA,
supplemented by data from LOFAR and Effelsberg. The observed structures feature
sharp edges and filaments, with nearly uniform and moderately steep spectral
indices ($\alpha$, mostly within $-1.2\leq\alpha\leq-0.8$), indicating
turbulence. Well-sampled radio spectra for the lobes' diffuse region are
derived using the continuous injection (CI) model (with $\alpha_{\rm
inj}\simeq-0.86$ and $\nu_{\rm b}\simeq1.72\rm\,GHz$), and for its three
localized regions using the impulsive injection model (e.g., JP model). From
energy equipartition analysis, we estimate the typical magnetic field strength
in the lobes' diffuse region to be $B_{\rm eq}\simeq10\,\mu\rm G$. The age of
the lobes is estimated as $\sim30-50\,\rm~Myr$, based on lifetimes derived from
the CI and JP models and sound crossing time. Outflow powers of
$\sim(0.2-2)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the lobes' diffuse components
and $\sim(1-11)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the whole source are
calculated. With this power assessment, we conclude that the galactic stellar
wind has a negligible effect, the active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven jet can
provide the necessary energy for the whole system. Furthermore, we argue that
while the wind driven by current AGN activity is unlikely to power the lobes'
diffuse components, an average enhancement of AGN activity by a factor of $\sim
10^2$ over the past $\sim 30-50$ Myr remains plausible.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21947v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): The

mass plane (sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy
Survey (DEVILS) - suggesting that the point at which the minimum in the
dispersion occurs (M$^{*}_{\sigma-min}$) defines a boundary between different
physical mechanisms affecting galaxy evolution. Here we expand upon that work
to determine the movement of galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane using
their recent star-formation histories (SFHs) and explore how this leads to the
observed $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation. We find that galaxies in
sub-regions of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane show distinctly different SFHs,
leading to a complex evolution of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane and star-forming
sequence (SFS). However, we find that selecting galaxies based on stellar mass
and position relative to SFS alone (as is traditionally the case), may not
identify sources with common recent SFHs, and therefore propose a new selection
methodology. We then use the recent SFH of galaxies to measure the evolution of
the SFS, showing that it has varying contributions from galaxies with different
SFHs that lead to the observed changes in slope, normalisation and turnover
stellar mass. Finally, we determine the overall evolution of the
sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane from $z\sim1$ to today. In the second paper in this

the C/O abundance ratio. However, little is known about the composition and C/O
ratio of disks around young stars in clusters exposed to strong ultraviolet

spectroscopy of d203-504, a young 0.7 $\rm M_{\odot}$ star in the Orion Nebula

spectroscopic signatures of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_3^+$, and PAHs. Water and CO are
detected in absorption in the inner disk ($r\lesssim 1$ au), where the
estimated gas-phase C/O ratio is 0.48, consistent with the Solar value and that
of the Orion Nebula. In contrast, \ch{CH3+} and PAHs are found in the extended

chemically shielded from UV radiation while the surface layers of the disk
experience UV-induced chemistry, potentially depleting their carbon content.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22117v1" target="_blank"><h2>The sulfur plume in the Horsehead nebula: New detections of S$_2$H,

cold molecular clouds. Sulfur allotropes (S$_{\rm n}$) have been proposed as
possible reservoirs, but the only detected interstellar molecule with a
disulfide bond is S$_2$H in the Horsehead Nebula, making the estimation of
sulfur chains abundances difficult. Here we present total-power ALMA images of
H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$, and SH$^+$ towards the Horsehead nebula. These
observations, with unprecedented sensitivity (rms $\sim$ 1.5 mK), provide the
first detections of SH$^+$ and CO$^+$ in this region, together with the
identification of a new S$_2$H line. The comparison of the spectroscopic images
of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$ and SH$^+$ shows that the S$_2$H emission
originates from a warm gas layer adjacent to the photodissociation front. The
emission peak of S$_2$H is offset from those of reactive ions such as SH$^+$,
CO$^+$, and SO$^+$, suggesting that gas-phase reactions involving SH$^+$ and
H$_2$S are not the dominant formation pathway of S$_2$H. Instead, we propose
that S$_2$H is desorbed from irradiated grain surfaces by non-thermal
processes. The SH$^+$ detection indicates that sulfur is not significantly
depleted at the UV-irradiated edge of the molecular cloud, arguing against a
major refractory sulfur reservoir in the interior of molecular clouds.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22574v1" target="_blank"><h2>Attention-based Neural Network Emulators for Multi-Probe Data Vectors

Such precision enables attention-based emulators to be directly applied to real

Combined with pre-processing techniques and optimized activation and loss
functions, attention-based models can meet the precision criteria set by
current and future CMB and lensing experiments. For each of Planck, Simons
Observatory, CMB S4, and CMB HD, we find the fraction of outlier points to be
less than $10\%$ with around $2\times10^5$ to $4\times10^5$ training data
vectors. We further explore the applications of these methods to supernova
distance, weak lensing, and galaxy clustering, as well as alternative
architectures and pre-processing techniques.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21945v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deuterated water abundance in the young hot core RCW 120 S2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Maria. S. Kirsanova, Anastasiia A. Farafontova</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to Astronomy Letters, comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Since the emission of water molecules cannot be observed from Earth, less
abundant isotopologues, such as H$_2^{18}$O and HDO, are used to trace water in
star-forming regions. The main aim of this study is to determine HDO abundance
in the hot core RCW 120 S2. We performed observations of the hot core in the
200-255~GHz range using the nFLASH230 receiver on the APEX telescope. Two HDO
lines were detected toward RCW 120 S2. Their intensities are described by
excitation temperature $286\pm2$~K and gas number density $\geq
10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm
dense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column
density ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable
value $5.6\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen
nuclei is $1.5\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest
reported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O
line, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early
stages.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22534v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bayesian reconstruction of primordial perturbations from induced
  gravitational waves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aya Ghaleb, Ameek Malhotra, Gianmassimo Tasinato, Ivonne Zavala</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 32 pages, 14 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from
amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate
scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the
primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We
present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the
scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW
observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the
GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence,
aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the
reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and
recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately
reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of
state, if different from radiation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22066v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic Strings as Dynamical Dark Energy: Novel Constraints</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hanyu Cheng, Eleonora Di Valentino, Luca Visinelli</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages including references, 5 tables, and 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic strings, topological defects predicted by high-energy theories, may
contribute to the late-time expansion of the Universe, effectively mimicking
dynamical dark energy. We investigate four phenomenological extensions of the
$\Lambda$CDM model involving a residual string network: (i) a non-relativistic
component with positive energy density (Model~1), (ii) a velocity-dependent
extension (Model~2), (iii) a non-relativistic string network with energy
density allowed to take both positive and negative values (Model~3), and (iv) a
general scenario with free energy and velocity parameters (Model~4). These
models are constrained using \textit{Planck} CMB data, SDSS or DESI baryon
acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae observations. Models~1 and~2
yield strong upper bounds on the string density, for example,
$\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} < 0.00901$ at 95\% CL from the CMB+DESI+DESY5 combination
for Model~2, and mildly shift the inferred value of $H_0$ upward, though they
are not favored by Bayesian evidence. For the same combination, the bulk
velocity is bound as $v_{\mathrm{s}} < 0.569$. Models~3 and~4 exhibit a
consistent preference for slightly negative values of $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}}$,
with CMB-only data yielding $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} = -0.038^{+0.029}_{-0.022}$
and $v_{\mathrm{s}}< 0.574$ in Model~4, and a best-fit improvement of $\Delta
\chi^2 = -6.07$. However, these improvements are not sufficient to overcome the
Occam penalty, and the Bayesian evidence continues to favor $\Lambda$CDM. These
findings demonstrate the power of current data to constrain exotic energy
components and encourage further exploration of string-inspired extensions to
$\Lambda$CDM, particularly those involving negative-tension networks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22512v1" target="_blank"><h2>The stellar evolution perspective on the metallicity dependence of
  classical Cepheid Leavitt laws</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Saniya Khan, Richard I. Anderson, Sylvia Ekström, Cyril Georgy, Louise Breuval</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 11 figures, submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The impact of metallicity on the Cepheid Leavitt law (LL) and, in turn, the
Hubble constant, has been the subject of much recent debate. Here, we present a
comprehensive analysis of metallicity effects on Cepheid LLs based on synthetic
Cepheid populations computed using Geneva models and the SYCLIST tool. We
computed 296 co-eval populations in the age range of 5-300 Myr for
metallicities representative of the Sun, the LMC, and the SMC ($Z \in [0.014,
0.006, 0.002]$). We computed LLs in fourteen optical-to-infrared passbands and
five reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes. All Cepheid populations take into
account distributions of rotation rates and companion stars. We show excellent
agreement between the predicted populations and key observational constraints
from the literature. Our simulations predict a significant LL slope-metallicity
dependence ($\beta_{\rm M} > 0$) that renders LLs steeper at lower metallicity
at all wavelengths. Importantly, $\beta_{\rm M} \ne 0$ implies that the
intercept-metallicity dependence, $\alpha_{\rm M}$, depends on pivot period; an
issue not previously considered. Comparison with $\alpha_{\rm M}$ measurements
in individual passbands reported in the literature yields acceptable agreement
on the order of agreement found among different observational studies. The
wavelength dependence and magnitude of the disagreement suggests a possible
origin in reddening-related systematics. Conversely, we report excellent
agreement between our $\alpha_{\rm M} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$ mag dex$^{-1}$ and the
value determined by the SH0ES distance ladder in the reddening-free H-band
Wesenheit magnitude ($-0.217 \pm 0.046$), the currently tightest and
conceptually simplest empirical constraint.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22219v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the Hubble parameter with the 21 cm brightness temperature
  signal in a universe with inhomogeneities</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Subhadeep Mukherjee, Shashank Shekhar Pandey, A. S. Majumdar</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages , 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble
tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing
Buchert's averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the
background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and
curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the
effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data.
Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a
shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift
curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a
remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T_{21}$. Such a substantial
difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate
that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed
further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.</p></br></body>
