($M_{\rm{halo}}^{z=1}=10^{12}-10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z\sim4$ may be
predominantly neutral, and could produce damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs)
along sight-lines to background quasars \citep{Stern2021}. A circumgalactic
medium (CGM) origin for DLAs naturally explains high redshift HI
absorption-selected galaxy detections at physical separations much greater than
the likely extents of the galaxy disks \citep{Neeleman2017, Neeleman2019}. The
observed $z\sim 4$ DLA HI column densities are large and comparable to
interstellar (ISM) gas columns at which substantial molecular hydrogen (H$_2$)
abundances occur. We therefore investigate the possible molecular content of
high-redshift CGM gas, and its potential detectability via (rest-frame)
far-ultraviolet (UV) absorption line studies. For this purpose we develop an
analytic sub-grid model for HI-to-H$_2$ transitions and incorporate the model
with zoom-in FIRE-2 simulations of evolving high-$z$ galaxies. We include dust
absorption and scattering computations for the transfer of photodissociating
Lyman-Werner (LW) band radiation. We find that the typical extents of
detectable H$_2$ sightlines are $\approx 0.1\, R_{\rm vir}$, independent of
redshift from $z=2.5$ to 5. We argue that a CGM origin for DLAs naturally
explains the low detection rates of H$_2$ in DLA observations, as the low CGM
densities and relatively strong far-UV fields lead to molecular fractions much
lower than observed in the ISM at comparable HI columns.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12599v1" target="_blank"><h2>SMILES Data Release II: Probing Galaxy Evolution during Cosmic Noon and

to their optical/UV luminosity, whether intrinsically (i.e., the coronal
emission is fainter) or due to large column densities of absorbing material.
The SDSS-V is providing optical spectroscopy for samples of quasar candidates
identified by eROSITA as well as Chandra, XMM or Swift, making the resulting
datasets ideal for characterising the BAL quasar population within an X-ray
selected sample. We use the Balnicity Index (BI) to identify the BAL quasars
based on absorption of the CIV $\lambda\,1549$ emission line in the optical
spectra, finding 143 BAL quasars in our sample of 2317 X-ray selected quasars
within $1.5\le z \le3.5$. This observed BAL fraction of $\approx$ 6 per cent is
comparable to that found in optically selected samples. We also identify
absorption systems via the Absorption Index (AI) which includes mini-BALs and
NALs, finding 954 quasars with AI $>0$. We consider the CIV emission space
(equivalent width vs. blueshift) to study the BAL outflows within the context
of the radiatively driven accretion disc-wind model. X-ray selection excludes
the highest outflow velocities in emission but includes the full range of
absorption velocities which we suggest is consistent with the BAL gas being
located further from the X-ray corona than the emitting gas. We observe both
X-ray weak and X-ray strong BALs (via the optical-to-X-ray spectral slope,
$\alpha_\text{ox}$) and detect little evidence for differing column densities
between the BAL and non-BAL quasars, suggesting the BALs and non-BALs have the
same shielding gas and intrinsic X-ray emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Population III star formation near high-redshift active galactic nuclei</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ethan M.

of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes
in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy
distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can
produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in
surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is
available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or
direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to
an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III
host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute
self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We
include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray
portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas
collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to
cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner
radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form,
except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead
form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to
the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the
James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting
clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z
~ 15.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15490v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measurement of circumgalactic extinction in the Kilo-Degree Survey's

especially dust, remains less well understood. We aim to investigate the amount
and distribution of dust in galactic halos by measuring shifts in the observed
magnitudes of background galaxies. Dust absorbs and scatters shorter-wavelength
light, reddening background sources. We quantify this effect using multi-band
magnitude shifts in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4,
distinguishing it from achromatic magnification. Our pipeline is validated
using MICE2 mock catalogues, and we explore potential systematics arising from
galaxy selection, in contrast to previous quasar-based studies. Simulations
show that input halo and dust masses can be recovered independently and jointly
using galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and magnitude shifts. A minimum redshift
separation of $\Delta z_{\mathrm B}\sim0.3$ and brightness cuts are required to
minimise overlap effects and the effects of photometric noise, respectively.
Applying our pipeline to KiDS data, we first confirm the achromaticity of
magnitude shifts in five near-infrared filters ($ZYJHK_{\rm s}$). In optical
bands ($ugri$), joint analysis constrains halo mass and dust mass to $0.2$ dex
and $0.3$ dex, respectively, yielding $M_{\rm dust}=7.24^{+0.52}_{-0.64} \times
10^7\,M_\odot$ and $\log(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm DM}/M_\odot)=12.33^{+0.08}_{-0.04}$.
These results agree with previous studies and represent the first successful
measurement of magnitude shifts and halo extinction with KiDS, confirming that
galaxies reside in extended baryonic halos enriched by gas and dust from
feedback processes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14668v1" target="_blank"><h2>The differences in the Narrow Line Region of nearby QSOs 1 and 2 -- I:

2 QSOs for redshifts $0.4 \le z \le 0.5$ via the analysis of their emission
line properties in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) near-UV/optical spectra. We
fit the continuum and emission lines, using two kinematic components for
\oiii$\lambda$5007 and \hb\ (narrow and broad) and a single component for the
weaker lines. We find two main differences in the NLR excitation of type 1 and
2 QSOs: (i) QSOs 2 have higher \oiii/\hb\ than QSOs 1 in both narrow and broad
components; (ii) QSOs 1 present higher \nev, \neiii\ and \oiii$\lambda4363$
luminosities, higher \nev/\neiii\ and \neiii/\oii\ ratios and higher
temperatures than QSOs 2. These differences support more highly excited
regions, higher temperature gas and prevalence of shocks in type 1 relative to
type 2 QSOs. We suggest two possible scenarios: (i) type 1 QSOs are seen more
pole-on, allowing the observation of more highly excited gas closer to the
nucleus, supporting the Unified Model scenario; (ii) evolution from type 2 to
type 1 QSOs, with highest excitation regions obscured in type 2's and cleared
up in a ``blow-out phase". Support for the evolutionary scenario is given by
the usually higher L\oiii\ in QSOs 2, in the sense that these sources host a
more powerful AGN that, in its evolution, clears up the excess dust and gas to
reveal a lower-luminosity but more highly excited type 1 AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14350v1" target="_blank"><h2>New Insight from the James Webb Space Telescope on Variable Active
  Galactic Nuclei</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan, Wei Leong Tee, Feige Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (title), dust (abstract), AGN (abstract), AGN variability (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic
AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their
engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies
largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam
imaging data from three surveys over $\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field,
we found 117 galaxies with $\geq 4$$\sigma$ variability in the F356W band
across a $\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic
data in this area, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$--3.69, which were all
coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the
last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using
the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic
subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two
others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be
explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause.
However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines
($\Delta v > 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow
permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2
based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair,
show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification
model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15905v1" target="_blank"><h2>Glimmers in the Cosmic Dawn. III. On the Photometrically Determined

Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) using photometry from both the Hubble Space Telescope

We designed a bespoke SED fitting code which decomposes the total SED into its
stellar and AGN contributions. Our SED fitting retrieves a significant
contribution to the total SED from an AGN template for 26 of our variable
sources with $0 < z < 7$. We leverage the model AGN spectrum to estimate black
hole masses ($M_{BH}$) using the measured luminosity at 5100 \r{A} and local
empirical calibrations. Common with recently discovered JWST broad line AGN
(BL-AGN), we observe a trend in the $M_{BH} - M_{\ast}$ plane where low
redshift sources have $M_{BH}$ which agree with local relations while high
redshift sources have increasingly overmassive black holes with respect to the
stellar mass ($M_{\ast}$) of their host galaxies. Within our sample, we
identify two IMBH candidates hosted by dwarf galaxies at $z<1$ featuring
overmassive BHs in the $M_{BH}-M_{\ast}$ plane, similarly to our high redshift
sources. Finally, our SED fitter successfully retrieves the AGN nature of one
source at $z >6$. This object has $z_{phot} = 6.74$ and we estimate a lower
limit on its black hole mass of $\log_{10}(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) > 7.36$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12556v1" target="_blank"><h2>Group Therapy for Halos: Advancing Halo Mass Estimation for Galaxy

to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as
cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two
complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial
theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the
three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using
state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock
light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model
dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible
systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ =
0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields
the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but
shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across
the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including
the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar
mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended
for GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is
required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates
across diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3. These calibrated estimators
will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection
between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14221v1" target="_blank"><h2>Massive Extremely High-Velocity Outflow in the Quasar

date in our survey of extremely high velocity outflows (EHVO).
J164653.72+243942.2 (z ~ 3.04) shows variable CIV1548,1551 absorption at speeds
larger than 0.1c, accompanied by SiIV, NV and Lya, and disappearing absorption
at lower speeds. We perform absorption measurements using the Apparent Optical
Depth method and SimBAL. We find the absorption to be very broad ({\Delta}v
~35,100 km/s in the first epoch and ~13,000 km/s in the second one) and fast
(vmax ~ -50,200 km/s and -49,000 km/s, respectively). We measure large column
densities ($\rm \log N_{H} >$ 21.6 $\rm\ [cm^{-2}]$) and are able to place
distance estimates for the EHVO ($5\lesssim R\lesssim28$ pc) and the
lower-velocity outflow ($7\lesssim R\lesssim540$ pc). We estimate a mass
outflow rate for the EHVO to be $\dot M_{out}\sim50-290\rm \ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$
and a kinetic luminosity of $\log\ L_{KE}\sim46.5-47.2\ \rm [erg\ s^{-1}$] in
both epochs. The lower-velocity component has a mass outflow rate $\dot
M_{out}\sim10-790\rm \ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of $\log\
L_{KE}\sim45.3-47.2\ \rm [erg\ s^{-1]}$. We find that J164653.72+243942.2 is
not an outlier among EHVO quasars in regard to its physical properties. While
its column density is lower than typical BAL values, its higher outflow
velocities drive most of the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity. These
results emphasize the crucial role of EHVOs in powering quasar feedback, and
failing to account for these outflows likely leads to underestimating the
feedback impact on galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15915v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid preparation. Establishing the quality of the 2D reconstruction of

Universe. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify
filaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these
methods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled
spectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the
filaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric
redshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of
larger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift
precision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments
extracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific
survey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of
filament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid
Wide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare
two filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the
Euclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm
DisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution
and Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several
characteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare
skeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy
positions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between
filaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical
considerations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We
assess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify
filaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey.

the potential to pin down the relationship between the low density gas in the
cosmic web and how the galaxies that lie within it grow using this material. We
report the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that
form a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded
within a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that
spans at least $\sim 15$~Mpc. We find that the spin axes of the HI galaxies are
significantly more strongly aligned with the cosmic web filament
($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.64 \pm 0.05$) than cosmological
simulations predict, with the optically-selected galaxies showing alignment to
a lesser degree ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.55 \pm 0.05$). This
structure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of
galaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also
find strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the
filament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus
far, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum
from the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies
along the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the
filament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where
the imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic
time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13597v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy

dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters
possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally
remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational statistical
detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, by using a sample of 2,170
systems with $M > 10^{14}\, M_\odot$ selected from a publicly available group
catalog based on the SDSS galaxy. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the
orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference
($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a
trial axis. We find strong statistical evidence for coherent rotation, with the
observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution significantly exceeding randomized
controls (nearly $\sim150\sigma$ confidence at $\sim380~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$),
especially in richer clusters ($N_{\mathrm{gal}} > 10$, up to $\sim300\sigma$).
Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and
blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the
rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The
cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim330~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$
at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim800~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$.
Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin
and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer
systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters,
shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13761v1" target="_blank"><h2>Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using

All comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), IGM (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to
its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM)
and properties of the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the
21-cm signal and infer IGM properties by leveraging multi-wavelength synergies.
This builds on our earlier study, where we developed the synergy between
high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), cosmic X-ray and radio
backgrounds (CXB and CRB), 21-cm global signal non-detection from SARAS~3, and
21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, to constrain the astrophysical
properties of Population II galaxies. Through a combination of CXB and HERA
data, we find the IGM kinetic temperature to be $T_\text{K}(z=15)\lesssim
7.7~\text{K}$, $2.5~\text{K} \lesssim T_\text{K}(z=10) \lesssim 66~\text{K}$,
and $20~\text{K}\lesssim T_\text{K}(z=6) \lesssim 2078~\text{K}$ at 95\%
credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data place an upper limit on
the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving $T_\text{rad}(z=15) \lesssim
47~\text{K}$, $T_\text{rad}(z=10)\lesssim 51~\text{K}$, and
$T_\text{rad}(z=6)\lesssim 101~\text{K}$. These constraints, strengthened by
the inclusion of UVLFs from HST and JWST, allow us to place the first
\textit{lower bound} on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough
of depth ${-201~\text{mK}\lesssim T_\text{21,min} \lesssim -68~\text{mK}}$ at
$z_\text{min}\approx10-16$, and a power spectrum of $8.7~\text{mK}^2 <
\Delta_{21}^2(z=15) < 197~\text{mK}^2$ at $k=0.35~h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our
results provide promising predictions for upcoming 21-cm experiments, and
highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early

hydrogen makes Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) robust tracers of the
intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus sensitive probes of cosmic
reionization. We present an extensive study of the Ly$\alpha$ evolution from
galaxies at 4.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the
CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The
combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$-break
galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N>3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We
trace the redshift evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction with EW$_0$ >25
A (X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such
analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the
average JWST X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ values from multiple fields. However, JWST
measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate
this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at
z$\sim$6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly$\alpha$ slit-loss of 35
$\pm$ 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly$\alpha$
emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to
7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly$\alpha$ visibility, from which
we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X$_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = 0.7--0.9. Finally,
we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of
$R_{\mathrm{ion}}$ = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of
N/$\langle$N$\rangle$ = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the
photometric completeness limit. Compared to the large ionized region at
z$\sim$7 in the EGS field, these results indicate significant field-to-field
variation, supporting a patchy, inhomogeneous reionization process.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14155v1" target="_blank"><h2>Little Red Dots and their Progenitors from Direct Collapse Black Holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Junehyoung Jeon, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Seiji Fujimoto, Anthony J.

objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra
indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that
gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population
of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly
found in the high-redshift Universe ($z\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse
black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely
metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the
most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code
A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD
demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH
population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models
agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties.
Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to
be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to
reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios -
high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed
to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington
accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on
stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be
reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an
additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to
further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12076v1" target="_blank"><h2>Examining AGN UV/Optical Variability Beyond the Simple Damped Random

UV/optical continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). However,
recent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full
spectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light
curves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 < z < 2.71$, as a
noise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the
optical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the
Zwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters,
two for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for
describing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO
model describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than
the best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit
correlations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black
hole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the
best-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term
variability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal
fluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term
variability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability
originating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO
modeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves
delivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11044v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST NIRCam Imaging of NGC 4258: I.

Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258, which hosts strong star formation regions as well
as an anomalous jet-like radio structure that extends through a significant
portion of its disk. This galaxy provides a unique environment to study Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven shocks and their impact on the interstellar
medium (ISM) as its proximity allows for narrow-band observations of various
near-infrared tracers sensitive to multiple levels of shock and radiative
excitation: [Fe II] (1.64 $\mu$m), Pa$\alpha$ (1.87 $\mu$m), H$_2$ (2.21
$\mu$m), 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, Br$\alpha$
(4.05 $\mu$m), and Pf$\beta$ (4.66 $\mu$m), allowing us to trace shocks with
parsec-scale resolution. Comparing these near-infrared observations with
available ultraviolet, optical, radio, and X-ray imaging, we find that shocks
present in the brightest regions of the anomalous radio structure are likely of
low-velocity (50-100 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting that these features originate
from AGN-driven winds that interact with the host medium and mechanically
impart energy into the disk. Further, while co-spatial [Fe II] and H$_2$
emission indicate multi-phase shocks, PAH emission is relatively weaker or
absent in the most shock-excited regions, consistent with the destruction of
small dust grains. Finally, we propose that surveys identifying enhanced [Fe
II] in AGN host galaxies may systematically reveal a key population where AGN
feedback is significantly coupled with the surrounding ISM and actively shaping
galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12283v1" target="_blank"><h2>How the cosmic voids contribute to stalling and quenching the giant

closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void
surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR.
Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder
algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void
surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that
only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge
10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular
alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples
according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or
bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found
that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases
that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower
sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the
analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of
a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local
tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due
to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial
infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant
void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of
cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also
discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface
galaxies as a probe of dark energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10709v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the near ultraviolet (near-UV) band. Among the
25 individual targets in the polarized archives, 8 had no published analysis
until the beginning of this series of papers. We tackle the last 5 targets in
the following. In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging
polarimetry of AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially
resolved polarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78,
as well as near-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A
and 3C 109. We make use of the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the
first paper in this series to homogeneously analyze the five remaining
polarized observations of AGNs in the FOC archives. In Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, we
find a polarization pattern in the narrow-line regions consistent with
scattering from an obscured nucleus. For NGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV
polarization parallel with the inner radio jet, related to synchrotron
emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially resolved centro-symmetric
polarization patterns in both opposite outflows, highlighting the scattering
origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109 shows high nuclear polarization,
consistent with AGN-dominated emission and parallel with the radio axis, but in
tension with polarization arising from dichroic absorption invoked by previous
authors. The imaging polarimetry obtained for the narrow-line region and the
extended scattering medium surrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the
predictions of the unified AGN model and demonstrates the power of
spatially-resolved polarimetric observation to decipher the complex

interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from
enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star
formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting
cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star
formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features
located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar
populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the
stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause,
with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations
are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst
aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star
clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star
formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In
the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and
cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star
formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds
associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the
halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star
formation, producing the observed episodic structure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11998v1" target="_blank"><h2>The origin of extreme N-emitters in star-forming galaxies at z$<$0.5

high-redshift galaxies, has been seen in local star-forming galaxies displaying
high log(N/O) values ($\geq\!-1.1$) at relatively low O abundances,
12+log(O/H)$\leq$8. Understanding the physical origins of these extreme
N-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment
mechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With
direct N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational
data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1),
we report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$<$0.5). Our sample
of N-emitters represents a five-fold increase in their known number at low-z
with 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8, and statistically, $2.21\pm0.91$\% of DESI DR1 SFGs
with reliable O and N abundances obtained directly, are extreme N-emitters. The
sample spans a mass range of $\sim 10^7$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ with
12+log(O/H) range of $\sim$7.1 - 8.2, and the N-emitter fraction is found to
increase with increasing stellar mass and decreasing metallicity. The most
extreme N-emitter in our sample has log(N/O)=$-0.53\pm0.13$, while also having
the lowest 12+log(O/H)=$7.08\pm0.09$ and the highest stellar mass,
log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)=$9.95\pm0.13$ among our sample. With galactic chemical
evolution models, we show that sustained N-enhancement by asymptotic giant
branch stars, in conjunction with presence of outflows, can well explain the
high log(N/O) of low-z extreme N-emitters. While single starbursts with outflow
are sufficient to explain lower-mass N-emitters, more massive ones require a
dual starburst scenario where a secondary starburst is triggered by inflow of

is also detected in the inter-arm region between the Perseus and Outer arms in
the G50 region. The Galactic molecular disk in this inter-arm region is found
to be thinner than that in the adjacent spiral arm region. In addition, the
thickness of the Galactic molecular disk examined here is found to be
correlated with the warp of it, indicating their homologous origins. The
molecular disk has a typical thickness of ~220 pc in the inner Galaxy.
Moreover, the dispersion of the MC systemic velocity decreases with increasing
galactocentric radius, resulting in lower kinematic distance uncertainties at
larger radii. However, the Perseus arm segment in the G120 region exhibits a
relatively large cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion and split components in its
MC velocity distribution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11926v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping feedback signatures in 3C 297: A quasar-host merger at Cosmic

bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense ISM and/or
jet precession. Archival HST imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology
of the host with a bright ~30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure
of line-emitting gas and clumpy blue excess emission co-spatial with the radio
hotspots. Our VLT/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex,
spatially-resolved H{\alpha}+[NII] emission in this source. A prominent
blue-shifted wing in H{\alpha} indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to
~18 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H{\alpha} data
with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in
the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the
ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the
feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio
source dominates the feedback with possible contribution from radiation
pressure due to AGN accretion. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon
likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new
starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13267v2" target="_blank"><h2>A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for

galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable
distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack
completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do
not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal
is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to
2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger
astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys --
including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added
spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the
sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all
ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered
20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and
mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of
photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The
resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances
under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse
fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to
360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles
the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable
hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most
complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe,
built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger
astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be
released to support broad community use.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13312v1" target="_blank"><h2>MeerKAT-derived HI kinematics and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation in

transforming our understanding of the dense environment of galaxy clusters and
its impact on individual galaxies. Discerning between intrinsic and
externally-induced properties of galaxies, including their gas kinematics, is a
key diagnostic in the field of galaxy evolution. In this work, we present
MeerKAT HI spectral line observations of the redshift z $\sim$ 0.042 galaxy
cluster Abell 3408. A total of 64 galaxies are detected in HI in this
X-ray-luminous galaxy cluster (L$_{X}$ $\sim$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{43}$ ergs
s$^{-1}$). We model the HI morphology and gas kinematics of the individual
galaxies, using a semi-automated pipeline based on CANNUBI and pyBBarolo. The
pipeline was developed and tested as part of this study. Of the 64 galaxies
detected in the cluster, we successfully modelled 16, while the remaining
galaxies exhibit disturbed HI morphologies, insufficient angular or velocity
resolution. We combine the galaxies with converged kinematic fits with 67 field
galaxies from the MeerKAT spectral line survey early science data
($\langle$z$\rangle$ = 0.0435) to produce a measurement of the Baryonic
Tully-Fisher Relation (bTFr) that encompasses a broader range of environment
and provides a useful comparison. We find a slope ($\alpha$ =
3.66$^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$) for this relation, which is consistent with that found
from the MIGHTEE bTFr derived from the same definition. Interestingly, HI
detections of the Abell 3408 galaxy cluster galaxies are seen to extend the
bTFr of the MIGHTEE sample, both in mass and velocity, despite their cluster

black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these
high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active
galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily
compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at
redshift z < 8 and their abundance declines by z < 5. Recent theoretical studies
have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the
early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results
from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations,
where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the
Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes.
We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling
those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs
in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z < 6, akin to the emergence of
LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated
with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense
luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation
of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are
associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and
hot dust.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14972v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Fraction of Clumpy Galaxies in JWST Surveys over $2 < z < 12$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alexander de la Vega, Bahram Mobasher, Faezeh Manesh, Niloofar Sharei, Nima Chartab, Zahra Sattari</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to AAS Journals; 26 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables, and 2 short appendices; code to reproduce Fig. 7, a catalog of physical properties, and empirical PSFs can be found atthis https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-redshift galaxies exhibit compact regions of intense star formation,
known as ``clumps,'' which are conspicuous in the rest-frame ultraviolet.
Studying them can shed light on how they form and evolve and inform theoretical
models of galaxy evolution. We examine the evolution of clumpy galaxies with
redshift and stellar mass over $2 < z < 12$ with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
imaging from the JWST Advanced Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Off-center clumps
are detected in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV) using similar techniques
to those in earlier studies based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This
is done for a sample of 9,121 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses
$\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 8$. The fraction of clumpy galaxies,
$f_{\rm{clumpy}}$, increases from $\sim20\%$ at $z>6.5$ to $\sim80\%$ at
$z\sim2.75$ at $\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 9$. Our
$f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ values are generally higher at fixed redshift and increase
faster with decreasing redshift than what studies based on HST data found,
which we attribute largely to the higher sensitivity of JWST. Clumps make up
$15-20\%$ of the NUV luminosity of clumpy galaxies, with little dependence on
redshift or stellar mass. $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ correlates with stellar mass and
there is little correlation with specific star-formation rate. Our
$f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ measurements are compared with those from simulations as well
as other observations. At low redshifts ($z\lesssim5.75$) and
intermediate-to-high stellar masses ($\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq
9$), our results suggest gas fragmentation due to violent disk instabilities to
be the dominant mechanism for forming clumps. At high redshifts and low stellar
masses, compression of gas during mergers appears to dominate.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10982v1" target="_blank"><h2>The extended molecular gas of the Circinus galaxy and NGC 1097 as seen

NGC 1097 in CO(2-1), covering their full optical extents. We detect gas at the
largest extents seen for these galaxies yet, at 5$^{\prime}$ ($r \approx 6$

analyze the large-scale gas kinematics via PV diagrams and tilted ring modeling

hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet
Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new
ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here
further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral
resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a
detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward
the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each
sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and
relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis
of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and
oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component
of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and
is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely
consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of
hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the
observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such
mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic
and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and
that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in
dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14890v1" target="_blank"><h2>Estimating Initial Mass of Gaia-Enceladus Dwarf Galaxy with Chemical

Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with
astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a
machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and
chemical parameters, especially $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$,
$\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of
metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for
Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution
model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the
$\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas
mass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\times10^9\,{M_{\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus,
placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model
scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a
rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a
lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data
in other chemical planes (e.g., $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this
scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way.
Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in
Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier
inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of
chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient
accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star
formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the
metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13136v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey: spatially resolved star formation

gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation,
linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to
understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at $z > 2$
due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas
tracers. The [CII] $158 {\rm \mu m}$ line has recently emerged as a key probe
of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate
whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift
remain valid at $4 < z < 6$ by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the
ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at
$\sim2$ kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution
(SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a
statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel
covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two
[CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas
surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation
with a slope of $0.87 \pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \pm 0.03$ dex,
which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\sim5$. The resolved
KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a
fixed global $\alpha_{\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr,
while a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with
high gas density in the starburst regime ($ < 0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both
simulations and observations are required to better understand how the
[CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to
break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\gtrsim4$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15899v1" target="_blank"><h2>CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host

their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all
hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation
and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and

  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age
have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the

We map the spatially resolved kinematics of the [O III] gas and stars, and
investigate the alignments between their global kinematic position angles (PA).
Large-scale gas motions are primarily dominated by rotation, and are
kinematically aligned with the stars ($\Delta\text{PA}\leq 30$ deg). However,
eight galaxies exhibit non-rotational kinematic signatures (e.g., kinematic
twists, possible outflows) in their ionized gas velocity fields near the

width of the [O III] line core as a surrogate for $\sigma_\star$. Direct
comparisons between $\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ and $\sigma_\star$ show that
$\sigma_{\text{gas}}$ tends to underestimate $\sigma_\star$, and thus is not a
reliable tracer of $\sigma_\star$ for our selected galaxies. We measure the

massive clusters (YMCs) as key building blocks of early galaxies. They are not
only important constituents of galaxies, but also potential birthplaces of very
massive stars (VMSs) and black hole (BH) seeds. We explore stellar dynamics in
extremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of $\rho_h \gtrsim
10^8M_\odot{\rm pc}^{-3}$ at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the
densest clusters seen by JWST. Using direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations
with stellar evolution, we show that VMS formation through collisions is
unavoidable, with final masses reaching $5\times10^3$ to $4\times10^4M_\odot$.
These results support the existence of a critical mass scale above which
collisions become highly efficient, enabling the formation of VMSs and
intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our models, using nbody6++gpu and MOCCA with
updated SSE/BSE routines, show that dense clusters rapidly form VMSs via
stellar bombardment. The VMSs then collapse into BH seeds of a few $10^3$ to
$10^4M_\odot$ in less than 4 Myr. We identify a critical mass-density threshold
beyond which clusters undergo runaway collisions that yield massive BH seeds.
For typical YMCs detected by JWST, efficiencies up to 10% are expected,
implying BH masses up to $10^5M_\odot$ if formed via collisions. We predict a
scaling relation for BH mass, $\log(M_{\rm
BH}/M_\odot)=-0.76+0.76\log(M/M_\odot)$. Frequent VMS formation may also

black holes, with many being measured to be $\sim100$ times more massive than
local galaxies with the same stellar mass. Here, we find that a population of
these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of
their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass
density at $z \sim 5$ would be comparable to local values. This would not occur
if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be
expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the
central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected
$z \sim 5$ black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation
if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These
systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than
expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black
hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison
to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because
growth must be rapid at $z > 5$ in order to build up such massive black holes
quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have
on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15901v1" target="_blank"><h2>Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN): III.

extragalactic studies, providing insights into the physical and chemical
conditions of the cold molecular gas, a reservoir for star formation. Since
star formation occurs within molecular clouds, mapping CO isotopologues at
cloud-scale is important to understanding the processes driving star formation.
However, achieving this mapping at such scales is challenging and
time-intensive. The Surveying the Whirlpool Galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA
(SWAN) survey addresses this by using the Institut de radioastronomie
millim\'etrique (IRAM) NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to map the
$^{13}$CO(1-0) and C$^{18}$O(1-0) isotopologues, alongside several dense gas
tracers, in the nearby star-forming galaxy M51 at high sensitivity and spatial
resolution ($\approx$ 125 pc).We examine the $^{13}$CO(1-0) to C$^{18}$O(1-0)
line emission ratio as a function of galactocentric radius and star formation
rate surface density to infer how different chemical and physical processes
affect this ratio at cloud scales across different galactic environments:
nuclear bar, molecular ring, northern and southern spiral arms. In line with
previous studies conducted at kiloparsec scales for nearby star-forming
galaxies, we find a moderate positive correlation with galactocentric radius
and a moderate negative correlation with star formation rate surface density
across the field-of-view (FoV), with slight variations depending on the
galactic environment. We propose that selective nucleosynthesis and changes in
the opacity of the gas are the primary drivers of the observed variations in
the ratio.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10987v1" target="_blank"><h2>A massive, evolved slow-rotating galaxy in the early Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ben Forrest, Adam Muzzin, Danilo Marchesini, Richard Pan, Nehir Ozden, Jacqueline Antwi-Danso, Wenjun Chang, M.

gravity. However, a small fraction of the most massive galaxies which are no
longer forming stars (i.e., they are quiescent) are dispersion supported, and
are termed 'slow-rotators.' These galaxies, which are highly evolved and often
exist in dense cluster environments, are theorized to be formed by a history of
merger activity that on average decreases the angular momentum of the merged
system and disturbs any disk structure. At high redshift, such extreme
slow-rotating systems are predicted to be far less common. While observations
of massive high-redshift galaxies which enable kinematic studies are
challenging to obtain, all previous data have revealed systems that are
rotating rapidly. No slow-rotators have been confirmed from stellar kinematics
beyond z~2. In this work we present results from James Webb Space Telescope
near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of XMM-VID1-2075, a massive,
quiescent galaxy at z=3.449 with a morphology exhibiting clear low-surface
brightness asymmetries and with a measured spin parameter of $\lambda _{R_e} =
0.101 \pm 0.018$, consistent with the lack of rotation seen in slow rotators in
the local Universe. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that merger
activity played a key role in the formation and kinematic transformation of
some of the most massive galaxies when the Universe was < 2 Gyr old, much
earlier than previously observed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13454v1" target="_blank"><h2>Three-Dimensional Polarimetric Structure of Jets from Radio Galaxy MRC

Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of
which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the
interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has
produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the
jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we
performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source
using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed
the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion
function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and
some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure
on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday
depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization
analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the
synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from
the magnetic field on the cold front.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15337v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN Disks: Tracing Massive Black Hole

from dwarf galaxies by combining metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) with
orbital parameters. Using apogalactic distance-orbital phase space, we assume
that the MDF peak of a substructure reflects its progenitor's chemical
signature. We test this approach with two Galactic potentials (St\"ackel and
McMillan) and find consistent results. Our sample consists of retrograde halo
stars with low orbital inclinations and intermediate eccentricities ($0.5 < e
\leq 0.7$), drawn from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopy combined with $Gaia$ DR3
astrometry. We identify four distinct low-inclination retrograde substructures
(LRS 1, LRS 2, LRS 3, LRS 4) with MDF peaks at [Fe/H] = $-$1.5, $-$1.7, $-$1.9,
and $-$2.1, respectively; LRS3 is newly discovered. Further analysis reveals an
additional stream (LRS 2B) with [Fe/H] = $-$2.3 embedded within LRS 2; the
remaining LRS 2 stars (LRS 2A) are associated with Sequoia. LRS 1 is likely
linked to Thamnos 2 and Arjuna, and LRS 4 to I'itoi. Comparison with the ED-2
stream suggests LRS 2B is chemically distinct, but high-resolution spectroscopy
is required to confirm whether they originate from separate progenitors. Our
MDF-based approach demonstrates the utility of chemo-dynamical space for
uncovering halo substructures, while highlighting caveats such as metallicity
gradients and redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation, which may
blur the mapping between MDF peaks and progenitors.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12616v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially and Dynamically Extended Molecular Gas in Stephan's Quintet

prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial
scale of ~25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of
molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a
wide area (~120 x 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC7318B
and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal
tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1-0)
luminosity is $(2.47\pm0.12)\times10^9~\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$,
corresponding to a molecular gas mass of $(1.07\pm0.05)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$
assuming the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The global star formation
efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29-0.70 $\mathrm{Gyr^{-1}}$, comparable to
or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a
velocity range of ~1300 km/s, which can be divided into three components (low,
mid, high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC7318B and the
ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity
component, associated with NGC7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our
mapping reveals molecular gas extending ~100 kpc in projection along the inner
tail and north of it, containing $(1.64\pm0.08)\times10^9~M_\odot$ (15% of

While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail,
our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC7319.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14624v1" target="_blank"><h2>The revolution in strong lensing discoveries from Euclid</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Natalie E.

black hole (MBH) binary merger timescales depend strongly on the structural and
kinematic properties of their host galaxy. Stellar density, gas content, shape
and kinematics all play a role, combining in non-linear ways to effect the
evolution of the binary. The binary properties themselves, such as
eccentricity, mass ratio, and orbital plane, all matter as well. This makes it
nontrivial to estimate accurate cosmological MBH binary merger rates, or to
generate merger rate ranges that reflect the distribution of galaxy hosts and
orbits. Using an extensive set of high-resolution direct N-body simulations in
which the shape, structure, and kinematics of each galaxy host are directly
informed by observations, we map out MBH binary merger timescales over a range
of galaxy hosts and MBH binary orbits. This yields a convenient set of scaling
relations to determine MBH binary merger timescales -- and the range of merger
timescales -- as functions of basic observables. Such scaling relations can be
readily employed as a subgrid model in cosmological or semi-analytic studies,
for example, to model event rates for LISA or pulsar timing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11837v1" target="_blank"><h2>Blue supergiants in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101: comparison with H II

statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen

the extragalactic sky. In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major
molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps
constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to
variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as
a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to
validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on
far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar
reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening
maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to
$E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH
emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH
abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction
significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that
modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared
emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in
PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\mu$m

power spectra are limited by the perfect degeneracy between the LPnG parameter
$f_{\rm NL}$ and the bias parameter $b_{\phi}$ which encodes the response of
galaxy clustering to a change in the amplitude of primordial curvature
fluctuations. For galaxies observed by galaxy surveys, the relation between
$b_{\phi}$ and the galaxy bias $b_{g}$ is poorly understood and differs
significantly from the universal mass function ansatz. In this paper, we
investigate this non-universality in the context of dark-matter halos using the
Separate Universe framework, focussing on dark-matter halos selected by mass
and/or concentration. We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a
natural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter
halos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse
picture of halo formation. We further propose an explanation for the observed
non-universality in halos selected by concentration and corroborate it with
$N$-body simulations in scale-free (EdS) and $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ cosmologies.
In particular, we show that the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and halo bias
$b_{h}$ for halos selected by concentration in matter-dominated cosmologies
tends towards universality at the highest halo masses due to such halos
gravitationally dominating their environment throughout their evolution. We
also argue that concentration-selected halos of lower masses exhibit
non-universality due to their mass accretion being significantly affected by
the gravitational influence of neighbouring, more massive halos. Our results
suggest that any non-universality in high redshift ($z\gtrsim 3$), high-bias
objects observed by realistic galaxy surveys is entirely an artifact of the
associated selection function.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13001v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparing X-ray Emission Line Fluxes of NGC 5548 to NGC 1068</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Divya Patel, Maryam Dehghanian, Gary Ferland</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, 1 table, and has been accepted for publication in RNAAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Unification Model of AGN suggests that all AGN galaxies should exhibit

evolutionary histories, such that understanding the mechanisms that drive
morphological change can provide valuable insights into the galaxy evolution
process. These mechanisms largely correlate with local environment, ultimately
leading to the well-known local morphology-density relation. To explore how the
morphology-density relation is produced, we must look to earlier times, and
trace the co-evolution of environment and morphology in an un-biased and
self-consistent manner. Here we use new environmental metrics from the Deep
Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the spectroscopic
morphology-density relation at intermediate redshift (0.3 < z < 0.5) and compare
directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0 < z < 0.08.
Importantly, both the galaxy morphologies and environmental metrics in DEVILS
and GAMA are derived in a very similar manner, reducing any methodology biases.
We see a clear evolution in morphological classes between DEVILS and GAMA,
which is modulated by environment. These trends are consistent with a scenario
where in all environments disk-dominated galaxies are transitioning to
classical bulge+disk systems (potentially via minor mergers and/or secular
evolution), and in high-density environments there is an increasing prevalence
of visually-selected elliptical galaxies (potentially via major mergers and/or
disk fading); with the fraction of ellipticals increasing by ~0.3 in the most
dense regions over the last ~7Gyr, but remaining largely unchanged in
low-density environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11124v1" target="_blank"><h2>SQ-A: A Collision Triggered Starburst in Intra-Group Medium of Stephan's

starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is
triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated
with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b
(v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between
0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9".
The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an
intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the
component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s
component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the
complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features
of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes
of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps
belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time
of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600
km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced
SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas
compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF
in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in
more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas
accompanied by blast-wave shocks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15771v1" target="_blank"><h2>Overview of complex organic molecule observations in protostellar

ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice
abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the
importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger
differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or

be present in the interstellar medium (ISM) through their 3.4 and 6.9 $\mu$m
absorption bands. To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs,
the simplest, toluene ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This
demonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards
atomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter
its chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction
between H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were
measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene
leads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane
($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of
H-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further
hydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of
cyclohexane ($\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may
be fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a
smaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This
likely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low
flexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization. The
removal of the methyl group at high H-atom fluences provides a top down
formation route to smaller molecules with the possibility of the formation of a
radical cyclohexane combining with other species in an interstellar environment
to form prebiotic molecules.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11891v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-Energy Neutrinos from Cosmic-Ray Scatterings with Supernova

astrophysical conditions, this flux may be detectable with high-energy neutrino
telescopes, just considering the proton-neutrino scattering cross section
expected in the Standard Model. Furthermore, the center of mass energy of such

high-redshift barred galaxies. The origin of these bars remains unclear, and
their properties appear difficult to reconcile with the results of cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation. I present an example of a tidally induced
bar-like galaxy formed at z = 2.9 in the TNG100 suite of the IllustrisTNG
simulations. The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies
studied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally
induced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result
of a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG). It remained on a tight orbit around the host and survived until the
present, losing most of its initial mass and becoming red but preserving its
prolate shape. Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced
a few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made
it look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar
formed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears. This
example demonstrates that high-z bars should not be sought among the
progenitors of present-day simulated barred galaxies but rather among the
tidally interacting early population of galaxies in forming groups and
clusters. Some of these galaxies may have survived as ellipticals, and some may
have merged with their BCGs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13541v1" target="_blank"><h2>Little Red reionization factories</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fan Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 2 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this note, we suggest the possibility that an elucidation of the nature of

Specifically, it is hypothesized that intergalactic HI gas is compelled by the
tidal field associated with a growing gravitational entropy, in the form of gas
streams, into colliding at the LRD sites. The resulting shock heating and
compression encourage starburst activities, which subsequently photo-ionize the
gas into HII, that in turn shines into the rest-optical via bremsstrahlung
radiation within the minimal-timescale-cutoff (i.e., red) regime, before
escaping back into the intergalactic space, propelled by the newly
fusion-injected energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14701v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the farthest star clusters to the Small Magellanic Cloud</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

recently identified most external SMC star clusters, OGLE-CL-SMC0133,
OGLE-CL-SMC0237, and Lindsay~116, using deep GEMINI GMOS imaging. Once we
confidently cleaned their color-magnitude diagrams from field star
contamination, we estimated their fundamental parameters applying likelihood
techniques. We also derived their structural parameters from normalized star
number density radial profiles. Based on {\it Gaia} astrometric data,
complemented with kinematics information available in the literature, we
computed the 3D components of their space velocities. With similar ages (~ 2.2
Gyr) and moderately metal-poor overall abundances ([Fe/H] = -1.0 - -0.7 dex),
OGLE-CL-SMC0237 is placed at 2.6 kpc from the SMC center and shares its disk
rotation; OGLE-CL-SMC0133 is located at 7.6 kpc from the galaxy center and
exhibits a kinematics marginally similar to the SMC rotation disk, while
Lindsay~116 placed at 15.7 kpc from the center of the SMC is facing strong
perturbations of its orbital motion with respect to an ordered rotational
trajectory. Furthermore, its internal dynamical evolution would seem to be
accelerated -- it seems kinematically older -- in comparison with star clusters
in the outskirts of relatively isolated galaxies. These outcomes lead to
conclude that Lindsay~116 is subject to LMC tides.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16329v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulation based inference of the ionization history from the 2D 21 cm

first stars and the reionization of the intergalactic medium during the Cosmic
Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The timing of these important
milestones has only roughly been constrained through indirect measurements,
such as from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) optical depth, and
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Therefore, inferring the neutral fraction over cosmic
time is a goal of upcoming 21 cm experiments, such as the Square Kilometer
Array (SKA). We contrast two approaches to infer astrophysical parameters and
ionization history from 21 cm 2D power spectra (2DPS). We develop an emulator
of the 21 cm 2DPS, trained on 21cmFAST simulations, taking into account the
expected instrumental noise from the SKA and sample variance. We then perform
simulation based inference (SBI) using neural posterior estimation (NPE). We
compare training on datasets of noisy 2DPS obtained from 21cmFAST simulations
and an emulator, to infer astrophysical parameters of interest. Using an
emulator of the ionization history, which has been trained on simulations from
the same astrophysical parameters, we then obtain posterior distributions of
the ionization history over the redshift range z $\sim$ 5-12. We demonstrate
that both methods are capable of accurately recovering the ionization history
and astrophysical parameters. However, coverage tests indicate that adding
emulated samples does not improve predictions. This work suggests that due to
the stochastic nature of the 2DPS, using an emulator of this summary statistic
may result in poorer inference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10878v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova Program: Motivation, Design,

serve as one of the most viable keys to unlocking our understanding of cosmic
expansion, isotropy, and growth of structure. The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky
Supernovae (DEBASS) program will deliver the largest uniformly calibrated
low-$z$ SN Ia data set in the southern hemisphere to date. DEBASS utilizes the
Dark Energy Camera to image supernovae in conjunction with the Wide-Field
Spectrograph (WiFeS) to gather comprehensive host galaxy information. By using
the same photometric instrument as both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the
DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey, DEBASS not only benefits from a robust
photometric pipeline and well-calibrated images across the southern sky, but
can replace the historic and external low-$z$ samples that were used in the
final DES supernova analysis. DEBASS has accumulated more than 400
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of $0.01 < z < 0.08$ from
2021 to mid-2025, and, in this paper along with a companion paper Acevedo et
al. submitted, we present an early data release of 77 SNe within the DES
footprint to demonstrate the merit and constraining power of the data set.
Here, we introduce the DEBASS program, discuss its scientific goals and the
advantages it offers for supernova cosmology, and present our initial results.
With this early data release, we find a robust median absolute standard
deviation of Hubble diagram residuals of $\sim$0.10 mag and an initial
measurement of the host-galaxy mass step of $0.06\pm0.04$ mag, both before
performing bias corrections. This low scatter shows the promise of a low-$z$ SN

self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to the hydrodynamic equations via a
continuous function of the local Knudsen number. The method, an SIDM-hydro
hybrid (SHH), allows more efficient simulation of the evolution of
inhomogeneous halos deep into the regime of gravothermal collapse. With the
improved efficiency gained by moving to a hydrodynamical description in
high-density regions, the SHH method allows central densities of two orders of
magnitude higher to be reached in considerably less simulation time than
traditional methods. Our implementation should be considered as the first step
toward a robust SHH method, as we interpolate the first and second moments of
the Boltzmann equation in the ideal-fluid limit only. The simulation results
are qualitatively similar to those found with other methods, although there are
differences in the implementation of the primary physics driving the dynamics,
and in the details of the resulting halo profiles. However, our results
indicate that the SHH technique shows promise to investigate gravothermal
collapse in diverse, dynamical environments. The method can be extended to
incorporate non-ideal fluid terms and dissipation, as needed for dark-matter
scenarios where interactions beyond the elastic regime may be important in the
dense interiors of some halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10902v1" target="_blank"><h2>Web-Halo Model (WHM): Accurate non-linear matter power spectrum

improves the precision of matter clustering predictions, particularly in the
challenging 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime, where standard halo models
often fail. Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters,
our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting
parameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by
incorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments)
and one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with
1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework.
We show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision
of state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all
redshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\% accuracy up to scales
of $k = 0.4\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\,
h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively,
for both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full
$w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM} + \sum m_\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a
substantial improvement over 1$\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which
performs similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite
its 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into
existing HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11811v1" target="_blank"><h2>Frequentist Cosmological Constraints from Full-Shape Clustering

method for clustering measurements from Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy

Theory models of galaxy clustering can be highly sensitive to the choice of
priors for extended cosmological models, frequentist inferences are not
susceptible to such effects. We compare Bayesian and frequentist constraints
for the parameter set $\{\sigma_8, H_0, \Omega_{\rm{m}}, w_0, w_a\}$ when
fitting to the full-shape of the power spectrum multipoles, the
post-reconstruction Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, as well as
external datasets from the CMB and type Ia supernovae measurements. Bayesian
prior effects are very significant for the $w_0w_a$CDM model; while the $1

likelihood estimate (MLE) and the MAP - indicating strong prior volume
projection effects - unless supernovae data are included. We observe limited
prior effects for the $\Lambda$CDM model, due to the reduced number of

structure (LSS) is an important step in understanding properties of the early
universe, specifically in distinguishing between different inflationary models.
Measuring PNG relies on evaluating the scale-dependent correlations in the
density field. New summary statistics beyond the two- and three-point
correlation functions in configuration space and their Fourier-space
counterparts, the power- and bi-spectrum may provide increased sensitivity. We
introduce a new method for extracting the PNG signal imprinted on the LSS by
using the first three Gaussian moments of the normalized correlation in density
perturbations, evaluated at varying distance scales. We aim to assess this
method's sensitivity to local PNG, parameterized by $f_ {\mathrm{NL}}$. We
perform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo
simulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field.
From these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model
expectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Our
method provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with
respect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find
that the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the
mean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its
simplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to
current and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14434v1" target="_blank"><h2>Breaking the Baryon Density$\unicode{x2013}$Hubble Constant Degeneracy

$H_0$. Here, we present a new possibility of breaking the degeneracy without
invoking early Universe priors on $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Assuming some FRBs
originate in compact object mergers, the combination of dispersion and
luminosity distance from the gravitational wave (GW) can be used to measure
$\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ (where $h$ is the dimensionless Hubble
constant). We show that this measurement can be combined with the abundant FRBs
that have a redshift measurement. This combination breaks the degeneracy with
the Hubble constant. We develop a Bayesian framework and forecast that
third-generation GW detectors are required to obtain meaningful constraints. We
forecast that one year of Einstein Telescope operations can constrain $H_0$ to

$\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ to $^{+0.0015}_{-0.0016}$ (68$\,\%$ credible

equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary
parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential
equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator
equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of
state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only
a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+
supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the
cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation
from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical
nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on
the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our
analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted
in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of
dark energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13262v1" target="_blank"><h2>MrMARTIAN: A Multi-resolution Mass Reconstruction Algorithm Combining
  Free-form and Analytic Components</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sangjun Cha, M. James Jee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ (Multi-resolution MAximum-entropy Reconstruction
Technique Integrating Analytic Node), a new hybrid strong lensing (SL) modeling
algorithm. By incorporating physically motivated analytic nodes into the
free-form method ${\tt MARS}$, ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ enables stable and flexible
mass reconstructions while mitigating oversmoothing in the inner mass profile.
Its multi-resolution framework increases the degrees of freedom in regions with
denser strong lensing constraints, thereby enhancing computational efficiency
for a fixed number of free parameters. We evaluate the performance of ${\tt
MrMARTIAN}$ using publicly available simulated SL data and find that it
consistently outperforms ${\tt MARS}$ in recovering both mass and
magnification. In particular, it delivers significantly more stable
reconstructions when multiple images are sparsely distributed. Finally, we
apply ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ to the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1--2403, incorporating
two analytic nodes centered on the northeastern and southwestern BCGs. Our mass
model, constrained by 412 multiple images, achieves an image-plane rms scatter
of ~0".11, the smallest to date for this dataset.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14019v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmology from a joint analysis of second and third order shear

function and the aperture-mass skewness measured from the Year 3 data of the
Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-Y3). The aperture-mass skewness
is a compressed representation of three-point shear information, designed to
capture non-Gaussian features while keeping the data vector computationally
tractable. We find that including the aperture-mass skewness improves the
$S_8$-$\Omega_m$ figure of merit by 80% compared to the 2PCF-only case,
primarily due to the breaking of degeneracies. Our joint analysis yields a
constraint of $S_8=0.736\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the
two-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\sigma$
in the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to
be internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect
no significant intrinsic alignment signal. We also explore extensions to the
$w$CDM model and find no evidence for deviations from a cosmological constant.
This work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific value of incorporating
third-order shear statistics into weak lensing cosmology and provides a
practical pathway for similar analyses in future Stage-IV surveys such as LSST,
Euclid, and Roman.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14018v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Cosmological constraints from second

using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data. We perform a complete
tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak
lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building
upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the
two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic
$\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full
shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a
joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm

$S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111%
of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to
$\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood
analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and
$w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint
$S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new
constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find
that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension
between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the
third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric
redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little
degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining
power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\langle M_{\rm

dark energy; however, most SN analyses rely on the same low-redshift sample,
which may lead to shared systematics. In a companion paper (arXiv:2508.10878),
we introduce the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova (DEBASS) program, which
has already collected more than 500 low-redshift SNe Ia on the Dark Energy
Camera (DECam), and present an initial release of 77 SNe Ia within the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) footprint observed between 2021 and 2024. Here, we examine
the systematics, including photometric calibration and selection effects. We
find agreement at the 10 millimagnitude level among the tertiary standard stars
of DEBASS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. Our simulations reproduce the observed
distributions of DEBASS SN light-curve properties, and we measure a
bias-corrected Hubble residual scatter of $0.08$ mag, which, while small, is
found in 10% of our simulations. We compare the DEBASS SN distances to the
Foundation sample and find consistency with a median residual offset of $0.016
\pm 0.019$ mag. Selection effects have negligible impacts on distances, but a
different photometric calibration solution shifts the median residual $-0.015
\pm 0.019$ mag, highlighting calibration sensitivity. Using conservative
simulations, we forecast that replacing historical low-redshift samples with
the full DEBASS sample (>400 SNe Ia) will improve the statistical uncertainties
on dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ by 30% and 24% respectively, enhance
the dark energy Figure of Merit by up to 60%, and enable a measurement of
$f\sigma_8$ at the 25% level.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11559v1" target="_blank"><h2>SN 2021aaev: a Hydrogen-Rich Superluminous Supernova with Early Flash

hydrogen-rich, superluminous supernova with persistent (at least $\sim100$
days) narrow Balmer lines (SLSN-IIn) at redshift $z=0.1557$. We observed
SN\,2021aaev to rise in $32.5 \pm 1.0$ days since first light and reach a peak
absolute magnitude of $-21.46 \pm 0.01$ in the ATLAS $o$ band. The pre-peak
spectra resemble those of typical SNe IIn with flash-ionization features
arising from the interaction with a dense, confined circumstellar medium (CSM),
albeit the flash timescale is longer than usual ($>20$ days). Post peak, the
narrow emission lines evolve slowly, and the absence of ejecta features
indicates strong deceleration by the CSM. The total radiated energy (about
$1.41\times10^{51}$~ergs) is possible with a low-mass (1--$2\,M_{\odot}$)
ejecta ploughing into a massive (9--$19\,M_{\odot}$), extended (outer radius
$>1\times10^{16}$~cm) H-rich CSM, or alternatively, with magnetar-powered
models. Interestingly, the host environment consists of a spiral galaxy with a
red substructure in the south-eastern part, and the SN's exact location
coincided with the quiescent red substructure (star-formation
rate$=0.02^{+0.13}_{-0.02}\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$). Given the atypical
environment and the obscuring effect of the massive CSM, a thermonuclear (Type
Ia-CSM) origin cannot be ruled out. Altogether, SN\,2021aaev is a compelling
case to study the diversity of SLSN-IIn features and their host environment.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14392v1" target="_blank"><h2>CPL-parametrized cosmic expansion in Galileon gravity: Constraints from

$\omega_{DE}(z)=\omega_{0}+\omega_{a}\frac{z}{1+z}$. This parametrization
allows for a time-dependent expansion history consistent with the non-linear
Galileon field equations. To constrain the model parameters, we perform a MCMC

criteria yields $\Delta AIC=1.46$ and $\Delta BIC = 11.5$ indicating that the
Galileon model is a strong contender to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The

gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host
supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set.
By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift,
and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are on average
2.6$\times$ more constraining than sky-averaged limits. Bayesian model
comparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave
background (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean
Bayes factor of $0.87 \pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS
J153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS
J072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes
factors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\sigma$--$2.3\sigma$) and
$0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\sigma$--$1.6\sigma$), respectively, depending on the
empirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol
by identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to
verify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red
noise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops
to $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich
electromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and
spectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates,
though this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our
results suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of
these and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW

their formation pathways, providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of
redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety
of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from
initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals
possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion
through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In
the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to
compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors,
showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We
then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised
machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare
unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries
(stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated
approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space
representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with
subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised
random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned
latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying
dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and
the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings
motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the
mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and
electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15864v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum

general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we
demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star

reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial

significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it
exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3

characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha
\rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and
pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta
H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble

through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint
observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and
Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0},

respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a
positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range,
with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder
parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study
of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an
accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is
$14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the
sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These
findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for
explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.</p></br></body>
