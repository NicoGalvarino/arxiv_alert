M. Ferreira<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from current CMB data (Planck, ACT, SPT-3G) combined with DESI BAO data, and highlight the interplay of $n_s$ with the optical depth to reionization $τ$. The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $τ$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2σ$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $α$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $α$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $τ$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05099v1" target="_blank"><h2>PSR J0952-0607: Tightening a Record-High Neutron Star Mass</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Roger W.

With its fast spin and unusually low magnetic field, this NS has evidently experienced unusual evolution, likely connected with its high mass, which is now $2.5σ$ above that of the heaviest pulsar with a white dwarf companion, as measured by Shapiro delay techniques. By tightening the mass measurement, we also raise the maximum (commonly called Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) NS mass to $M_{\rm TOV} > 2.27\,M_\odot$$(2.12\,M_\odot)$ at $1σ$$(3σ)$ confidence, which improves bounds on the dense-matter equation of state. While the statistical error decreases and systematic issues should be modest, uncertainties remain; we comment briefly on these factors and prospects for further improvement.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05097v1" target="_blank"><h2>Highly-ionized gas in lensed z = 6.027 Little Red Dot seen through [OIII] 88$μ$m with ALMA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kirsten K.

We present deep ALMA observations of the redshifted [OIII] 88um line for the gravitationally lensed ($μ= 11.4\pm1.9$) galaxy A383-5.1 (z=6.027) that has previously been detected in [CII] 158um. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging identified this sub-L* galaxy as a ''Little Red Dot'' (LRD). With a line luminosity of $L_{\rm [OIII]} = (1.29\pm0.24)\times10^8$ L$_\odot$ (corrected for lensing magnification) A383-5.1 is one of the faintest galaxies with combined [CII] and [OIII] detections. The ALMA data reveal no dust continuum emission, consistent with previous observations. The high line luminosity ratio of [OIII]/[CII] $\sim 14\pm5$ is consistent with A383-5.1 being low-metallicity and dust-poor. The non-detection of dust continuum in bands 6 and 8 is consistent with the high [OIII]/[CII] ratio and suggests a presence of a strong ultraviolet radiation field, which would be less affect by dust attenuation, implying that galaxies of this type could contribute significantly to the ionization of the intergalactic medium. The presence of strong ionizing field could provide an important piece of information for understanding the nature of LRDs and their role in cosmic reionization.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05093v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving the molecular gas emission of the z~2.5-2.8 starburst galaxies SPT0125-47 and SPT 2134-50</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> K.

These galaxies are characterized by their high star formation rates and substantial infrared luminosities. The formation mechanisms remain an open question for these galaxies, particularly with respect to how such intense levels of star formation are triggered and maintained. We aim to resolve CO(3-2) emission toward two strongly lensed galaxies, SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50, at z~2.5-2.8 to determine their morphology and physical properties. We used high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations of CO(3-2) emission toward both sources to investigate their properties. We performed parametric and nonparametric lens modeling using the publicly available lens modeling software PyAutoLens. We divided the CO(3-2) emission line into two bins corresponding to the red and blue portions of the emission line and nonparametrically modeled the source plane emission for both bins. We performed a basic analysis of the morphology and kinematics in the source plane using nonparametric lens modeling of the red and blue bins. We found tentative evidence of a velocity gradient across both sources and no evidence of any clumpy structure, companions, or ongoing mergers. The previously calculated high star formation rates and low depletion times of both SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50 suggest that these galaxies are undergoing a dramatic phase in their evolution. Given the lack of evidence of ongoing interactions or mergers in our source plane models, we suggest that the intense star formation was triggered by a recent interaction and/or merger. We also consider the possibility that these galaxies might be in the process of settling into disks.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05078v1" target="_blank"><h2>Improving Posterior Inference of Galaxy Properties with Image-Based Conditional Flow Matching</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mikaeel Yunus, John F.

While spectroscopy provides precise measurements, it is observationally expensive, and photometry discards morphological information that correlates with mass, star formation history, metallicity, and dust. We present a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework that leverages pixel-level imaging alongside photometry to improve posterior inference of galaxy properties. Using $\sim10^5$ SDSS galaxies, we compare models trained on photometry alone versus photometry plus images. The image+photometry model outperforms the photometry-only model in posterior inference and more reliably recovers known scaling relations. Morphological information also helps mitigate the dust--age degeneracy. Our results highlight the potential of integrating morphology into photometric SED fitting pipelines, opening a pathway towards more accurate and physically informed constraints on galaxy properties.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05056v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sensitivity of Hongmeng 21cm experiment on scattering dark matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Junsong Cang, Yu Gao, Yin-Zhe Ma<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 3 figures, one table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> intergalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Scattering between dark matter and baryon can cool intergalactic medium temperature and deepen the 21cm signal. Such interactions have been proposed to explain the unusually deep 21cm absorption signal reported by EDGES in 2018. This paper explores the potential to detect dark matter - baryon scattering with the Hongmeng project, an upcoming lunar orbiting satellite experiment dedicated to measuring global 21cm signal between redshifts $11-46$. We self-consistently forward-model the simulated sky temperature data, jointly varying both the astrophysical and foreground models. We show that even with a very conservative observational strategy in which the experiment only takes data when both the Earth and the Sun are shielded by the Moon, Hongmeng can tighten the current constraints on dark matter - baryon scattering cross-section $σ_0$ by a factor of 21 after the full mission which lasts for five years. The prospective upper limit on $σ_0$ can reach $4 \times 10^{-43} {\rm cm^2}$ for dark matter masses between 0.1 MeV and 0.4 GeV. Even after only one month of observation, a factor of 3 improvement relative to current $σ_0$ limits can be expected.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05050v1" target="_blank"><h2>Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses II: validation tests with an extended sample</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Natalie B.

The leading order shape distortion is shear, which, if measurable, will be a complementary cosmological probe to traditional cosmic shear. In Hogg et al. (2025a), we modelled 23 of the SLACS strong lenses, studying the line-of-sight (LOS) shear under a variety of shear and mass model parametrisations. In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|γ_{\rm LOS}| > 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05041v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing AGN Feedback in Dwarf Galaxies with Spatially Resolved NIR Coronal Lines from JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Archana Aravindan, Thomas Bohn, Gabriela Canalizo, Shobita Satyapal, Vivian U, Weizhe Liu, William Matzko, Sara Doan, Matthew Malkan, Lee Armus, Tohru Nagao, Tanio Diaz-Santos, Aditya Togi, Thomas S.

Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W$_{80}$ > 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05035v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays: a laboratory for magnetic fields</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Philipp Mertsch<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Much has been learned about Galactic cosmic rays in the past decade: On the observational side, the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei have been directly measured with high precision, resolving chemical composition up to TV rigidities. At even higher rigidities, direct detection is making contact with indirect observations from air shower arrays. A number of breaks have been found in the nuclear spectrum, which was previously thought to be a pure power law up to the knee. Data from air shower arrays also show interesting features in the arrival directions of cosmic-ray nuclei. On the theoretical side, more sophisticated models are able to explain the various spectral breaks either with transitions between different classes of sources or with changes in the transport regime. Yet, it has become clear that our ignorance of the structure of the Galactic magnetic fields, both on large and small scales, is limiting precision predictions. Turning this problem into an opportunity though, we can use Galactic cosmic rays as a laboratory for the study of Galactic magnetic fields. In this review talk, delivered at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025), I have summarised what is known about the spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays, what is not known yet and what can be learnt in the future.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05029v1" target="_blank"><h2>The critical role of clumping in line-driven disc winds</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Amin Mosallanezhad, Christian Knigge, Nicolas Scepi, Knox S.

However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$ and yielding $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models. They can also reprocess a significant fraction of the disc luminosity and thus dramatically modify the broad-band optical/UV SED. Given that theory and observations indicate that disc winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous, clumping offers a physically motivated solution. Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Albert Escrivà, Jaume Garriga, Shi Pi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages and 11 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $ζ[ζ_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $δN$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04946v1" target="_blank"><h2>MALLORN: Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dylan Magill, Matt Nicholl, Vysakh Anilkumar, Sjoert van Velzen, Xinyue Sheng, Thai Son Mai, Hung Viet Tran, Ngoc Phu Doan, Thomas Moore, Shubham Srivastav, David R.

Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04934v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on Genesis Cosmology from the Smeared Null Energy Condition</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dong-Hui Yu, Mian Zhu, Yong Cai<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> cosmic evolution (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is essential for constructing nonsingular cosmological scenarios, such as Genesis cosmology, which avoids the initial singularity by initiating cosmic evolution from an asymptotically Minkowski state.

Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\rm \left<W1-W2\right>$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04893v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing TeV Afterglow Emission of GRB~221009A with Gaussian Structured jet in Wind-driven medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> T.

The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04891v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MALATANG survey: star formation, dense gas, and AGN feedback in NGC 1068</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shuting Lin, Siyi Feng, Zhi-Yu Zhang, Chunyi Zhang, Qing-Hua Tan, Junzhi Wang, Yu Gao, Xue-Jian Jiang, Yang Gao, Xiao-Long Wang, Junfeng Wang, Jian-Fa Wang, Satoki Matsushita, Aeree Chung, Kotaro Kohno, Tosaki Tomoka, Thomas R.

We present the HCN (4-3) and HCO$^+$ (4-3) maps of NGC 1068, obtained with JCMT as part of the Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies (MALATANG) project, and perform spatially resolved analyses of their correlations with infrared luminosity and soft X-ray emission. Spatially resolved relations between the luminosities of infrared dust emission and dense molecular gas tracers ($L_{\rm IR}-L'_{\rm dense}$) are found to be nearly linear, without clear evidence of excess contributions from AGN activity. The spatially resolved X-ray emission ($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$) displays a radially-dependent twofold correlation with the star formation rate (SFR), suggesting distinct gas-heating mechanisms between the galaxy center and the outer regions. A super-linear scaling is obtained in galactic center regions with SFR surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$) $>$ 8.2 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$: log($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/erg s$^{-1}$) = 2.2 log(SFR/$M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) + 39.1. We further found a statistically significant super-linear correlation ($β= 1.34$ $\pm$ 0.86) between $L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/SFR and HCN(4-3)/CO(1-0) intensity ratio, whereas no such trend is seen for HCO$^+$(4-3)/CO(1-0) or CO(3-2)/CO(1-0). These findings indicate that AGN feedback does not dominate star formation regulation on sub-kiloparsec scales, and that the excitation of dense gas traced by HCN (4-3) may be more directly influenced by high-energy feedback processes compared to HCO$^+$ (4-3) and CO (3-2).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04848v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo II: Chaotic Imprints in Gravitational Waves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Surajit Das, Surojit Dalui, Bum-Hoon Lee, Yi-Fu Cai<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th, nlin.CD<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages, 16 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04804v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with MUSE</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alessandro Veutro, Irene Di Palma, Marco Drago, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Robin van der Laag, Melissa López, Fulvio Ricci<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life can give rise to one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe. Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope. Among the three detector geometries considered here, the 2L with a relative inclination of $45^\circ$ is the one achieving the best results, thus being able to detect a Kuroda2016-like waveform with an efficiency above $90\%$ at 50 kpc.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04803v1" target="_blank"><h2>287,872 Supermassive Black Holes Masses: Deep Learning Approaching Reverberation Mapping Accuracy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuhao Lu, HengJian SiTu, Jie Li, Yixuan Li, Yang Liu, Wenbin Lin, Yu Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 9 figures.

We present ALMA QUARKS/ATOMS 1.3 mm/3 mm observations (the highest resolution $\sim0.01$ pc) of a deeply embedded HC H II region (diameter $\sim0.015$ pc, electron density $\sim2\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) exhibiting a striking $\gtrsim20$ km s$^{-1}$ global redshift seen in optically thin H30$α$/H40$α$ recombination lines relative to its parental hot molecular core within a hub-filament system. The 1.3 mm continuum data reveal a distinct 0.1-pc arc and a perpendicular 0.04-pc tail. We propose that this morphology arises from a dynamic champagne flow: the slow expansion of HC H II region into a pre-existing filament forms the arc and associated low-velocity (few km s$^{-1}$) SiO shocks. Meanwhile, in the opposite direction ionized gas escapes along a steep density gradient traced by the tail and high-velocity (20 km s$^{-1}$) SiO emission. We reject the bow shock scenario in which ionized gas co-moves with a runaway high-mass star because shocked gas in the arc aligns with the hub velocity, contradicting the bow shock prediction. Non-LTE radiative transfer modeling further rules out infall of ionized gas as the velocity shift origin. We conclude that this exceptional HC H II region is undergoing a few-thousand-year transition phase of "hatching out of the egg": the ionized gas of HC H II region has just broken out of its parental hot core and now is flowing outward supersonically. This work highlights how anisotropic density distributions induce supersonically anisotropic ionized flows that govern HC H II region evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04689v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Chandra view of SPT-CL J0217-5014: a massive galaxy cluster at a cosmic intersection at z=0.53</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dan Hu, Shida Fan, Zhongsheng Yuan, Junjie Mao, Norbert Werner, Yuanyuan Su, François Mernier, Yuanyuan Zhao, Liyi Gu, Haiguang Xu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted for publication in A&A; 11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables; abstract shortened due to arXiv character limit<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxy clusters trace the densest regions of the cosmic web and are crucial laboratories for studying the thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM). We present a Chandra study of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0217-5014 ($z \sim 0.53$; $M_{\rm 500} \sim 3 \times 10^{14}~\rm M_{\odot}$), previously reported as a Swift serendipitous clusters with the highest Fe abundance ($\sim 1.3\pm 0.4$ $\rm Z_{\odot}$ within $\sim 1'.7$) and a potentially disturbed morphology. The X-ray morphology reveals a disturbed ICM with a surface brightness edge at $\sim 0'.26$ ($\sim 100$ kpc) to the west and a tail-like feature extending towards the east. The best-fit metal abundance within 1'.5 ($\sim 0.7\rm R_{500}$) is $0.61_{-0.23}^{+0.26}~\rm Z_{\odot}$. The derived central electron number density, entropy, and cooling time classify this system as a non-cool-core cluster, suggesting that merger activity has likely disrupted the possible pre-existing cool core. At larger radii ($\sim 1' - 2'$), we detect excess X-ray emission to the south, spatially aligned with a filamentary distribution of red galaxies, indicating ongoing accretion along an intracluster filament. Based on the DESI DR9 cross-matched optical clusters and photometric redshifts, we identify three nearby, lower-mass clusters that likely trace the large-scale structures, suggesting that SPT-CL~J0217-5014 is the primary node of a dynamically active environment where past mergers and anisotropic accretion along cosmic filaments have shaped the present-day ICM.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04661v1" target="_blank"><h2>Velocity Dispersion Functions of Pressure-supported Galaxies in EAGLE Simulations with Varying AGN Feedback</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jungwon Choi, Jubee Sohn<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 13 figures, A&A accepted<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> feedback (title, abstract), AGN (title, abstract), AGN feedback (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the stellar velocity dispersion functions (VDFs) of pressure-supported galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulations. The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one "standard", two "enhanced", one "reduced", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($σ_{*}$ > 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 < $σ_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) < 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04582v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the H i mass-size relation using the Simba cosmological simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Omphile Rabyang, Ed Elson<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages , 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observational studies have established a remarkably tight power-law relationship between the H I masses and sizes of late-type galaxies, known as the H I mass-size relation. This relation has been shown to persist across various models of a galaxy's H I surface density profile. Using the Simba cosmological simulations, we investigate the robustness of this relation under different feedback prescriptions, including cases where specific feedback mechanisms are absent. While the global properties of galaxies are significantly affected by changes in feedback, the H I mass-size relation remains intact. Moreover, its parameters consistently align with the best available empirical measurements. We analyze the H I mass distributions of galaxies and demonstrate that, regardless of the feedback scenario, galaxies within a given H I mass bin exhibit outer H I radial profiles well approximated by an exponential function. Furthermore, the exponential decline rate remains remarkably similar across different physical prescriptions. We attribute the persistence of the H I mass-size relation to this inherent self-similarity in the H I mass distributions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04548v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining regular primordial black holes with isocurvature gravitational waves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ngo Phuc Duc Loc<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We find the constraint on the population of ultra-light regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) by using isocurvature gravitational waves (GW). If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $ΔN_{\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04508v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chlorine and Potassium Enrichment in the Cassiopeia A Supernova Remnant</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> XRISM collaboration<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$σ$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04473v1" target="_blank"><h2>On angular dependent response to gravitational-wave signals for time-delay interferometry combinations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pan-Pan Wang, Hao-Kang Chen, Wei-Liang Qian, Rui Luo, Jing Zhou, Wei-Sheng Huang, Yu-Jie Tan, Cheng-Gang Shao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are designed for wave sources in the millihertz band with different locations and orientations.
  Time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique is an indispensable ingredient in space-borne GW detection that effectively suppresses the laser phase noise.
  The abundant TDI solutions derived in the literature also feature distinct angular-dependent sensitivities.
  Because a GW source's angular location is unknown prior to the signals' detection, a solid-angle average is often performed when analyzing the sensitivity function of a given TDI combination.
  The present study explores the angular dependence of the detector's sensitivity.
  This detail is relevant, because once the initial detection is achieved, the source's location can be extracted and used to provide information on a refined TDI combination tailored for the specific GW source.
  As the TDI technique is a post-processing algorithm, such a procedure can be implemented in practice.
  We evaluate the angular dependence of the detector's response function to the GW signals for different TDI combinations as a function of the orientation angles.
  Moreover, we classify the response functions into seven categories at the low-frequency limit, leveraging the characteristics of the underlying geometrical TDI combinations.
  By further averaging out the azimuthal angle $φ_D$ in the detector's plane, the main features of the resulting response functions and their zenithal dependence with respect to the GW source are scrutinized.
  The findings presented in this work provide pertinent insights for ongoing space-borne detector programs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04362v1" target="_blank"><h2>ELG$\times$LRG distribution through dark matter halo dynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ginevra Favole, Francisco-Shu Kitaura, Boryana Hadzhiyska, Daniel J.

This integrates intra-halo dynamics, halo exclusion, and quenching, bridging insights from hydrodynamical, HOD, abundance-matching, and semi-analytic studies. Leveraging full phase-space information from the Uchuu N-body simulation, and sampling satellites from dark-matter particle positions via physically motivated prescriptions, HOMe reproduces the anisotropic clustering down to $s=200\,h^{-1}$kpc with unprecedented accuracy. Model parameters are inferred solely from two-point statistics using a two-level Bayesian framework, yielding high-fidelity ELG, LRG and cross-reference catalogs. We find that satellite ELGs behave as incoherent flows within their parent halos, dominating the clustering below $4\,h^{-1}$Mpc. The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\rm vir}\sim6.6\times10^{11}\,(1.2\times10^{13})\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans. HOMe high sensitivity precisely captures the dynamics of satellites in different host environments, opening a promising avenue for understanding systematics, the dynamical nature of dark matter, potentially distinguishing gravity models.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 27 papers (27 new, 0 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
