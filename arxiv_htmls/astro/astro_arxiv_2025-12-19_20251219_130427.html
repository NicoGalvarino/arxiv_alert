(..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16844v1" target="_blank"><h2>Connecting current and future dual AGN searches to LISA and PTA gravitational wave detections</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nianyi Chen, Yihao Zhou, Ekaterine Dadiani, Tiziana Di Matteo, Cici Wang, Antonella Palmese, Yue Shen, Junyao Li, Adi Foord, Simeon Bird, Yueying Ni, Yanhui Yang, Rupert Croft<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 16 figures; comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN) mark an observable stage of massive black hole (MBH) pairing in galaxy mergers and are precursors to the MBH binaries that generate low-frequency gravitational waves. Using the large-volume ASTRID cosmological simulation, we construct DAGN catalogs matched to current (COSMOS-Web, DESI) and forthcoming (AXIS, Roman) searches. With realistic selection functions applied, ASTRID reproduces observed dual fractions, separations, and host-galaxy properties across redshifts. We predict a substantial population of small-separation (<5 kpc) duals that current surveys fail to capture, indicating that the apparent paucity of sub-kpc systems in COSMOS-Web is driven primarily by selection effects rather than a physical deficit. By following each simulated dual forward in time, we show that dual AGN are robust tracers of MBH mergers: ~30-70% coalesce within $\lesssim 1$ Gyr, and 20-60% of these mergers produce gravitational-wave signals detectable by LISA. Duals accessible to AXIS and Roman are the progenitors of ~10% of low-redshift LISA events and ~30% of the PTA-band stochastic background. Massive green-valley galaxies with moderate-luminosity AGN, together with massive star-forming hosts containing bright quasars at $z>1$, emerge as the most likely environments for imminent MBH binaries. These results provide a unified cosmological framework linking dual AGN demographics, MBH binary formation, and gravitational-wave emission, and they identify concrete, high-priority targets for coordinated electromagnetic and GW searches in upcoming multi-messenger surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16837v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multiple Axions in Laboratory Experiments</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Arturo de Giorgi, Joerg Jaeckel, Sebastian Monath, Volodymyr Takhistov<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, hep-ex<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30+10 pages, 8 Figures, 1 Table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Axions and axion-like particles generically appear in extensions of the Standard Model. While many searches assume only a single axion species, there may exist a whole spectrum of multiple such fields. We develop general formulas for axion-photon oscillations in the presence of multiple axions and analyze the implications for experimental searches, including light-shining-through-a-wall experiments, helioscopes and haloscopes. We demonstrate that axion multiplicity can qualitatively alter observational signatures, particularly through coherence and interference effects. Multiple axions can not only enhance signals compared to single axion scenarios, but also suppress them. We show that variations of experimental parameters and searches allow identifying contributions of multiple axions and obtaining information about their properties.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16821v1" target="_blank"><h2>Delayed Scaling of Multi-Type Cosmic F- and D-strings in VOS Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kazuto Nakamura, Masaki Yamada<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 50 pages, 20 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory. We analytically calculate the scaling string density as a function of the reconnection probabilities, and confirm our results with numerical calculations. We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16815v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exponential plateaus and inflation in metric-affine gravity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Antonio Racioppi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, extends the results ofarXiv:2411.08031to a larger class of models<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a new mechanism for inflationary model building in the framework of metric-affine gravity.

In this work, we employ a model-independent approach to jointly reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_ν$, adopting the PCHIP method with seven fixed nodes in which we allow the two parameters to vary. We employ CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Supernovae Ia data to constrain the values of $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and $\sum m_ν$ at each node. We conduct three different analyses in which we reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$: one with fixed $\sum m_ν=0.06~\mathrm{eV}$; one in which we allow $\sum m_ν$ to vary, and one in which we also reconstruct $\sum m_ν$ using the PCHIP method. We find the dark energy equation of state to be consistent with the cosmological constant scenario, except when including DESI data and allowing for phantom crossing, where we find a $95\%$ CL deviation from $w_\mathrm{DE}=-1$ around $z\sim1.2$. For neutrino masses, we obtain looser constraints when focusing on phantom dark energy, that show further early and late relaxation when reconstructing the mass via the PCHIP method.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16728v1" target="_blank"><h2>A faint M$_{\rm UV} = -14.5$ Lyman continuum leaker in the reionization epoch: unprecedented Ly$α$ properties at z=5.725</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

A prominent, narrow, and nearly-symmetric Ly$α$ emission line is detected at the systemic redshift (the latter traced by H$β$, from JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy), with rest-frame $EW=150\pm10$ Å, $\rm FWHM=58\pm1$ km s$^{-1}$, and a slight asymmetry, resulting in a $\rm \sim10\%$ flux excess in the red wing of the line. The negligible velocity offset from systemic ($dv = 4\pm67$ km s$^{-1}$, $3σ$ uncertainty), together with the sharpness and symmetry of the profile, indicates minimal radiative transfer effects implying a neutral hydrogen column density consistent with an optically thin medium, compatible with a non-zero ionizing photon escape fraction. If indirect spectral diagnostics calibrated at $z<4.5$ remain the only viable tools to identify LyC leakers during reionization, then based on its strongest indicator (Ly$α$), AMORE6 stands out as one of the most compelling LyC-leaking candidates yet discovered in the reionization epoch.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16630v1" target="_blank"><h2>Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sergei Bulanov, Stepan Bulanov, Timur Esirkepov, Gianluca Gregori, Gabriele Grittani, Brandon Russell, Alec Thomas, Petr Valenta<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> physics.plasm-ph, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 27 pages, 8 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16621v1" target="_blank"><h2>The high-redshift radio galaxy 3C 294 at low frequencies: radio detection of the X-ray Ghost</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vijay H.

Using International Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) data at 144 MHz and Chandra data at 0.3-6 keV, we find that the co-spatial diffuse radio and X-ray emission is well described by synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes by the same electron population. Through modelling of this rare low-energy plasma, we find that the most defining property of the electrons up-scattering CMB photons at this redshift is very low electron Lorentz factors ($γ_{\text{max}}\ll 10^{4}$ and $γ_{\text{break}}\lesssim 10^{3}$) in the lobe: deep low frequency (<150 MHz) observations are critical to the detection of radio lobes at high redshift. The physical conditions imply a total energy in the diffuse emission significantly greater than that implied by the temperature of the protocluster gas: 3C 294 is one of the most powerful known radio-loud systems in a dense protocluster environment. Through resolved spectral analysis of archival radio data up to 15 GHz, we find evidence that the inner hotspots are due to restarted activity, while the outer hotspots remain energetic, suggesting a rapid duty cycle while the jet precesses. This allowed the low-energy aged plasma driving the X-rays to remain spatially distinct from the high-energy plasma. Together, our results promise a revelation of AGN-related radio emission at high redshift using future low-frequency arrays such as SKA-LOW.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16589v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST MIRI color classification of mid-infrared selected galaxies: MIRI color classification toward cosmic noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ece Kilerci, Tomotsugu Goto, Matthew A.

We used the largest Spitzer MIR spectral database to obtain synthetic photometry in the JWST/MIRI filters.

During the first week, the larger spherical shell, the S-shell, forms the photosphere. As the shell expands and becomes increasingly transparent, the photosphere moves inward along the mass coordinate, although it grows in size. When the photosphere reaches the long axis of the elongated inner shell, the E-shell begins to contribute to the photosphere, ultimately comprising the entire photosphere. The simple toy model explains the transition of Rph(t) from being concave (decreasing slope) to convex (increasing slope). A single-shell model predicts only concave behavior. The structure of a spherical shell with an inner elongated shell is motivated by the morphologies of several CCSN remnants whose structures have been attributed to multiple pairs of jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The deduced multiple-shell ejecta of SN 2024ggi in this study, and of SN 2023ixf in an earlier study, as well as studies of the polarization of SN 2024ggi, are better compatible with the JJEM than with the neutrino-driven mechanism. Our study supports the growing evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16551v1" target="_blank"><h2>Decoupling perturbations from background in $f(Q)$ gravity: the square-root correction and the alleviation of the $σ_8$ tension</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chunyu Li, Xin Ren, Yuhang Yang, Emmanuel N.

The square-root term leaves the background expansion unchanged while modifying the effective gravitational coupling, providing a pure decoupling between background cosmology and structure-growth evolution. Using the latest redshift-space distortion data, including DESI DR2 Full-Shape measurements, we constrain $M$ and $σ_8$ across three representative backgrounds: $Λ$CDM, an $H_0$-tension-reducing model, and a DESI-motivated dynamical dark energy scenario. In all cases, the square-root correction suppresses growth and can reconcile $σ_8$ with Planck at the $1σ$ level, with the strongest improvement occurring in the $H_0$-tension-oriented background. A residual degeneracy between $M$ and $σ_8$ remains, indicating that future multi-probe analyses combining lensing and full-shape clustering will be required to determine whether the $\sqrt{Q}$ term represents a genuine signal of modified gravity.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16549v1" target="_blank"><h2>N-emitters as possible sign-posts of GC formation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> D.

A recent statistical study of the N-emitter population has quantified the frequency $f_N$ of these rare objects and their redshift evolution (Morel et al. 2025). Using these results we here test if N-emitters trace the formation of GCs and use the observed cosmic star-formation rate density evolution to predict the cosmological evolution of the GC population with time, their age distribution, and the total present-day stellar mass density formed in globulars. The predicted age distribution of GCs strongly resembles the typical asymmetric observed distributions in the Galaxy and ellipiticals, with a peak at $\sim 11.5-12$ Gyr and a longer tail extending to younger ages. We derive a total stellar mass density formed in N-emitters down to redshift zero of $(2-7) \times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which matches within a factor $\sim 2$ the observed fraction of stellar mass found in the GC population at $z=0$. These results provide additional indirect arguments supporting the hypothesis that N-emitters could represent sign-posts of a short phase of GC formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16542v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy evolution in compact groups - III.

A subset - non-isolated CGs - are embedded within major structures. Using multi-band S-PLUS data, we analyse galaxies in 122 non-isolated CGs within more massive systems such as larger groups and clusters. We compare them to galaxies in the host structures, hereafter surrounding group galaxies. Structural parameters were obtained with MorphoPLUS, a pipeline for multi-wavelength Sérsic profile fitting. Dividing galaxies into early (ETG), transition, or late types (LTG), we find: (1) Non-isolated CGs host higher quenched fractions and more ETGs, especially for stellar masses $\log(M/M_\odot) > 10.2$, than surrounding groups. (2) Sérsic indices increase with wavelength for all morphological types in both environments, whereas effective radii show a stronger morphology-dependent behaviour - ETGs become more compact towards redder bands, while LTGs exhibit flatter $Re(λ)$ trends. Environmental differences remain weak, with only a modest enhancement of the gradients for ETGs in non-isolated CGs. (3) Transition galaxies in CGs show a concentrated $R_e$-$n$ distribution and faint-end bimodality, consistent with ongoing morphological transformation absent in surrounding groups. (4) Phase-space analysis indicates that some CGs in clusters are projection artefacts, while others are genuine dense systems at various infall stages, from recent arrivals to ancient remnants. These results show that galaxies in non-isolated CGs follow distinct evolutionary paths compared to their surrounding groups galaxies, suggesting that the compact configuration plays a unique role beyond the influence of the larger-scale environment.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16537v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chiral magnetic effect amplified baryogenesis at first-order phase transitions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hui Liu, Ligong Bian<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 4 figures, comments welcome!<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this study, we show that, in the background of the primordial magnetic field, the CME effect can significantly amplify the chiral chemical potential sourced by the CP violation near the bubble walls during the first-order electroweak phase transition.

We aim at understanding the properties of ULX winds and their link with the source spectral and temporal behavior. We performed high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the variable source NGC 55 ULX-1 to resolve emission and absorption lines as observed with XMM-Newton at different epochs. Optically-thin plasma models are used to characterise the wind. We confirmed and thoroughly strengthened previous evidence of outflows in NGC 55 ULX-1. The presence of radiative recombination signatures and the ratios between the fluxes of the emission lines favours photoionisation balance and low-to-moderate densities, which confirm that the lines originate from classical XRB disc winds. An in-depth parameter space exploration shows line emission from a slowly moving, cool, and variable plasma perhaps associated with a thermal wind. Mildly-relativistic Doppler shifts (about -0.15c) associated with the absorption lines confirm, at higher confidence, the presence of powerful, radiatively-driven, winds. The comparison between results obtained at different epochs revealed that the wind responds to the variability of the underlying continuum and these variations may be used to understand the actual accretion regime and the nature of the source.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16517v1" target="_blank"><h2>How massive neutrinos reshape the cosmic web</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Leonor N.

We find that increasing the neutrino mass shifts the volume-weighted density distribution towards higher densities and leads to a more narrow density distribution, which we interpret as neutrinos delaying structure formation. We construct the minimum spanning tree (MST) graph from the subhaloes, adopting a number density chosen to match that expected for DESI-like observations. We show that most MST edges lie in filaments, approximately 70% throughout different simulations, which we link to its sensitivity to neutrino mass. We also link the MST's edge length signal at different scales to different cosmic web environments, with clusters dominating the signal at small scales, voids at longer scales, and filaments at intermediate scales. The strong correlation between MST edges and cosmic web environments reinforces the MST's potential to be used as a classifier for large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. We compare the effects of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos and find that each produces distinct signatures in MST edge lengths. This analysis is performed in 3D space, using the true positions of subhaloes and not accounting for redshift space distortions. Nevertheless, these results emphasise the MST's capability to go beyond two-point statistics, motivating future applications to real observational data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16478v1" target="_blank"><h2>Uniform Rolling: An LSST Observing Cadence Offering Sufficient Survey Uniformity for Comprehensive Cosmological Analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Boris Leistedt, Matthew R.

Rubin Observatory promises to be the defining survey of the next decade, supplying unprecedented access to the night sky to static science- and time-domain science-focused researchers alike. Maximizing the output of the broad remit of Rubin Observatory science requires a non-trivial survey strategy. For time-domain science, the most promising strategy designed so far is a rolling survey strategy, whereby a subset of the full LSST survey area is observed at higher rate compared with the nominal rate dictated by weather conditions and the observatory's technical constraints. This strategy is now the baseline approach for the LSST as a whole. Focusing on static science (galaxy clustering and weak lensing), we study how these time-domain-optimized rolling strategies affect the depth uniformity at intermediate years of the survey. We characterize the amount of survey area at high risk of being lost in static-science analyses of a baseline rolling LSST dataset due to an insufficient combination of survey contiguity and uniformity. At intermediate data releases, nearly half of the survey could be lost for static science, decreasing the Dark Energy figure of merit by approximately 40\%. We describe additional metrics focused on key analysis tasks, such as photometric redshifts and galaxy clustering. We propose a new strategy that returns the survey to uniformity at key release years, enabling use of the full survey area and restoring our metrics to the values they would have in a non-rolling cadence without loss of time domain data relative to a rolling survey with the same number of rolling cycles. This work has informed the third round of optimization of the survey strategy, and the new uniform rolling strategies have been incorporated into the baseline strategy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16422v1" target="_blank"><h2>MUSE Analysis of Gas around Galaxies (MAGG) - VII.

Selecting SBLAs as spectral regions with transmitted flux $-0.05<F<0.25$ over $\approx138\text{ km s}^{-1}$ bins, we find a strong correlation with LAEs within a projected distance of $R\le300\rm\,kpc$ and line-of-sight velocity separation of $|Δv|\le300 \text{ km s}^{-1}$. The association rate increases significantly with decreasing flux, a trend that persists also at smaller separations ($R<100$ kpc). A two-dimensional cross-correlation analysis confirms significant clustering of LAEs around SBLAs, while no such clustering is seen for spectral regions with $F>0.25$. The correlation appears to also depend on the width of the spectral window used to identify SBLAs, with a larger window yielding a stronger signal. Our analysis confirms that SBLAs serve as probes of the CGM at the interface between the Ly$α$ forest and the optically-thick Lyman limit systems. The significant dependence of the LAE-SBLA cross-correlation on the spectral binning used to select these absorbers motivates future tests of the current SBLA framework as a tracer of halos.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16365v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AGN nature of strong CIII emitters in the Early Universe with JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

We present a study of CIII] emission in galaxies at z=5-7, using publicly available JWST/NIRSpec prism data from programs including CEERS, JADES, RUBIES and CAPERS. We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII $λ$1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII $λ$1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] $λ$5007, H$β$, [NeIII] $λ$3869, and [OII] $λλ$3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG. We find that half of the sources in our sample (29 out of 61 galaxies) exhibit at least one secure indication of AGN activity while 13 are potential AGNs based on the CIII] diagnostic. Physical properties, including stellar mass and star formation rate, are derived through spectral energy distribution modeling with Bagpipes. Our analysis reveals that JWST is uncovering a population of strong CIII] emitters at high redshift (5<z<7) with a median EW of 22.8 A. This EW is higher than that of a control sample of CIII] emitters at redshift 3<z<4 with a median EW of 4.7 A. We find that for the same range of Muv, the CIII] EW increases by $\sim$0.67 dex from 3<z<4 to 5<z<7, indicating strong redshift evolution in the line's strength.

Depending on the lens mass and the lens-source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16337v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modified light-cylinder and centrifugal acceleration in Schwarzschild geometry</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nikoloz Kurtskhalia, Nikoloz Maltsev, Zaza N.

While the majority of those applications require the knowledge of PSF of mid-mass and heavy nuclei, there is now renewed interest in $E1$ strength distributions of light nuclei in the framework of the PANDORA project, which aims at an understanding of the mass distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic radiation (UHECR).UHECR is of extragalactic origin and its interaction along the travel path is dominated by photoabsorption of cosmic background radiation boosted to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) energy region in the center-of-mass system. Thus, systematic knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections in light nuclei and of their subsequent particle decay is required. The purpose of this work is to enhance the database of available theoretical evaluations of PSF of light nuclei that are necessary in the studies of UHECR propagation. We employ the Configuration Interaction Shell Model (CI-SM) approach to provide predictions of $E1$ dipole response for $p$ and $sd$-shell nuclei, with mass number $A$ between 7 and 40. Theoretical predictions are compared to available data and to existing predictions from phenomenological and microscopic models.

Two decades ago, the concept of halo quenching was introduced as a dominant mechanism, positing that massive central galaxy quenching is governed by the thermodynamics of gas predominantly influenced by dark matter halos. However, a vastly increasing body of observational evidence consistently indicates that quenching correlates predominantly with central properties like velocity dispersion, bulge mass, and black hole mass. When these properties are controlled, halo mass appears to show weak influence, supporting AGN feedback as the primary mechanism. A recurring key issue, however, is that these studies rely on halo masses derived via abundance matching (AM). Direct observational measurements from weak lensing, satellite kinematics, and galactic dynamics reveal that AM systematically overestimates halo masses of star-forming centrals while underestimating those of passive ones. To accurately assess the true role of halo mass. we re-estimated halo masses for SDSS groups; the resulting halo mass function and stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for both populations match theoretical predictions and weak lensing measurements. Using these improved masses, we find direct observational evidence that halo mass is the dominant factor in quenching central galaxies, with a clear threshold at $M_{h}\sim 10^{12.1}M_\odot; $. By applying a simple correction to AM data using weak lensing-derived SHMRs, we demonstrate that previous claims regarding the dominance of central properties stem primarily from systematic biases in AM halo masses. Our results suggest that the significance of AGN feedback is primarily manifested in halos above this mass threshold, in galaxies already primed for quenching. In other words, AGN feedback appears to become effective in halos above this mass threshold.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16289v1" target="_blank"><h2>Astrophysical Implications of Eccentricity in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Isobel Romero-Shaw, Jakob Stegmann, Gonzalo Morras, Andris Dorozsmai, Michael Zevin<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 6 figures.

This raises the question of how an eccentric NSBH might form. Compact object binaries that form via isolated binary star evolution should radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}=0.003$; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher-order modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from eccentric binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\odot$ and a range of total masses from $3\,{\rm M_\odot} \leq M \leq50\,\rm M_\odot$, we find $0.008\leq e_{\mathrm{min},10}\leq0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular templated search to a population of NSBHs from field triples, finding that we recover only 27% of our simulated population. Finally, we show that if ~1/3 of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then all of them are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16215v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA and JWST Identification of Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies up to z~8</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jorge A.

Here, we present an effective empirical selection criterion based on a newly defined parameter: I_star = log(M_star) x log(SFR). Incorporating the F277W-F444W color as a second parameter further improves the purity of the selection. We then apply this method to the COSMOS2025 catalog to search for fainter dusty galaxy candidates below the ALMA CHAMPS detection limit and, through a stacking technique, identify a population of high-redshift (z=6-8) DSFGs with an average flux density of$S_1.2mm = 0.15uJy and a space density of ~6E-6 Mpc^-3. This faint population seems to have been missed by most of the previous submillimeter/millimeter surveys, and ground- and space-based UV-to-NIR surveys. Finally, we discuss the possibility of an evolutionary connection between the z > 10 UV-bright galaxies recently discovered by JWST, the faint dusty z=6-8 galaxies identified here, and the population of z=3-5 massive quiescent galaxies, potentially linked as progenitor-descendant populations based on their abundance, redshifts, and stellar masses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16208v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the properties and origin of massive quenched galaxies at $z\ge2$ in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ángel Chandro-Gómez, Claudia del P.

In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We report number densities and stellar mass functions in broad agreement with the latest observations. The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and $\rm H_{2}$ fractions more than $1$ dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local ($\rm 0.3\,cMpc$) to intermediate scales ($\rm 1.0\,cMpc$) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about $55\%$ of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies when they are selected at $z=3$, although up to $55\%$ experience rejuvenation episodes. Our results provide robust predictions for MQGs, show that tensions with observations are reduced when an effective observational uncertainty is forward-modelled, and clarify the mechanisms behind their origin.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16204v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16160v1" target="_blank"><h2>Understanding Pulsar Wind Nebulae with the SKA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Joseph D.

Measurements of magnetic structures of the Milky Way are still sparse in far regions of the Galactic disk and halo.

In this article, we give an overview of Galactic magnetic field investigation using pulsars. The sensitive SKA1 design baseline (AA4) will increase the number of known pulsars by a factor of around three, and the initial staged delivery array (AA*) will probably double the total number of the current pulsar population.

Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of neutron stars and discuss how the SKAO telescopes will aid in our understanding of the neutron star population.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16155v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic Centre Pulsars with the SKAO</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

The relativistic effects expected in such a system could far exceed those currently observable in compact binaries such as double neutron stars and pulsar white dwarfs. In addition, pulsars offer the opportunity to study the magneto-ionic properties of Earth's nearest galactic nucleus in unprecedented detail. For these reasons, and more, a multitude of pulsar searches of the Galactic Centre have been undertaken, with the outcome of just seven pulsar detections within a projected distance of 100 pc from Sagittarius A*. It is currently understood that a larger underlying population likely exists, but it is not until observations with the SKA have started that this population can be revealed. In this paper, we look at important updates since the publication of the last SKAO science book and offer a focused view of observing strategies and likely outcomes with the updated SKAO design.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16122v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inferring the Intrinsic Energy Function of FRB 20220912A</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiaohui Liu, Wei-Yang Wang, Weicong Jing, Xuelei Chen, Jinlin Han<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 6 figures. ApJ accepted<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The statistical analysis of fast radio burst (FRB) samples from repeaters may suffer from a band-limited selection effect, which can bias the observed distribution. We investigated the impact of this selection bias on the energy function through simulations and then applied our analysis to the particular case of FRB 20220912A. Our simulations show that, in the sample of bursts observed by the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), assuming a unimodal intrinsic energy distribution, the band selection effect alone is insufficient to produce a bimodal energy distribution; only the bimodal central frequency distribution can achieve this. The bursts' energy of FRB 20220912A that primarily fell within the observing band showed no significant correlation with the central frequency. In contrast, bursts with higher central frequency tend to exhibit narrower bandwidth and longer duration. The distribution of the intrinsic energy can be modeled as a log-normal distribution with a characteristic energy of $8.13 \times 10^{37}$ erg, and a power-law function with the index of $1.011 \pm 0.028$. In contrast to the initial energy function reported by \cite{2023ApJ...955..142Z}, the low-energy peak vanishes, and the high-energy decline becomes steeper, which implies the low-energy peak is an observational effect. The bimodality of the energy distribution seems to originate from the intrinsic radiation mechanism.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16049v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas Accretion from a Neighbouring Galaxy Fuels the Low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jin-Long Xu, Nai-Ping Yu, Ming Zhu, Chuan-Peng Zhang, Xiao-Lan Liu, Mei Ai, Peng Jiang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> How a seemingly `dead' host galaxy provides fuel for its active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains an unresolved problem. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we present a new high-sensitivity atomic-hydrogen (HI) observation toward the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 4278 and its adjacent region. From the observation, we found that external gas accretion from a neighbouring galaxy fuels the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278 through tidal interactions. The accreted gas entering NGC 4278 exhibits a rotating gas disk. And the accreted galaxy has been gas-poor and has an HI to stellar mass ratio of about 0.02. Due to the process of gas accretion, it is likely that relativistic jets are generated in the AGN of NGC 4278. The emission of TeV gamma rays in NGC 4278 is likely to be associated with the newly accreted HI gas.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16010v1" target="_blank"><h2>LSTM-MDNz: Estimating Quasar Photometric Redshifts with an LSTM-Augmented Mixture Density Network</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jianzhen Chen, Zhijian Luo, Liping Fu, Zhu Chen, Hubing Xiao, Shaohua Zhang, Chenggang Shu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), Euclid (abstract), SDSS (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Quasar photometric redshifts are essential for studying cosmology and large-scale structures. However, their complex spectral energy distributions cause significant redshift-color degeneracy, limiting the accuracy of traditional methods. To overcome this, we introduce LSTM-MDNz, a novel end-to-end deep learning model combining long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with mixture density networks (MDN). The model directly uses multi-band photometric fluxes and associated errors as wavelength-ordered sequential inputs, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering while enabling simultaneous point estimation and probability distribution function (PDF) prediction of quasar redshifts. We integrate data from four major sky surveys-SDSS, DESI-LS, WISE, and GALEX-to assemble a sample of over 550,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ($0 \leq z_{\mathrm{spec}} \leq 5$) across 14 ultraviolet to infrared bands for model training and testing. Experimental results show that using all 14 bands yields optimal performance, with a normalized median absolute deviation ($σ_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$) of 0.037 and an outlier rate ($f_{\mathrm{out}}$) of 3.5\% on the test set. These values represent reductions of 29\% and 56\%, respectively, compared to the commonly adopted SDSS+WISE band set. Probability integral transform ($\mathrm{PIT}$) and continuous ranked probability score ($\mathrm{CRPS}$) analyses confirm that the predicted PDFs align closely with the true redshift distribution. Band-ablation experiments further highlight the essential role of ultraviolet and infrared data in alleviating color degeneracy and reducing systematic bias. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-band fusion in improving quasar photo-z accuracy and offers a ready-to-use estimation framework for future surveys like LSST, CSST, and Euclid.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15991v1" target="_blank"><h2>ASKAP discovery of a 30 kpc bipolar outflow from the edge-on disk of the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 130-G012</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Baerbel S.

Partially obscured by Galactic foreground stars and dust, this optically unremarkable, low-mass galaxy reveals one of the largest known hourglass-shaped outflows from the full extent of its bright stellar disk. The outflow was discovered in 944 MHz radio continuum images from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) obtained as part of the "Evolutionary Map of the Universe" (EMU) project. Its height is at least 3x that of the stellar disk diameter (~10 kpc), while its shape and size most resemble the large biconical, edge-brightened FUV and X-ray outflows in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 3079. The large-scale, hourglass-shaped outflow of ESO 130-G012 appears to be hollow and originates from the star-forming disk, expanding into the halo with speeds close to the escape velocity before likely returning to the disk. Given ESO 130-G012's modest star formation rate, the height of the outflow is surprising and unusual, likely made possible by the galaxy's relatively low gravitational potential. Follow-up observations are expected to detect hot gas inside the bipolar outflow cones and magnetic fields along the X-shaped outflow wings. Neutral gas may also be lifted above the inner disk by the outflow.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15983v1" target="_blank"><h2>MAGellanic Outflow and chemistry Survey (MAGOS): Hot cores in the LMC</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Takashi Shimonishi, Kei E.

We present the results of a hot core survey toward 30 massive protostellar objects in the LMC using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 350 GHz. Continuum imaging reveals 36 compact sources in total, among which line analyses identify 9 hot cores and 1 hot-core candidate, including two newly identified sources. We detect CO, HCO+, H13CO+, HC15N, HC3N, SiO, SO, SO+, NS, SO2, 34SO2, 33SO2, CH3OH, 13CH3OH, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, H2CCO (tentative), and hydrogen recombination lines from hot cores. CH3OCH3, a complex organic molecule larger than CH3OH, is detected for the first time in a hot core outside the LMC bar region. All hot cores show stronger emission in the high-excitation SO line compared to non-hot-core sources, suggesting that its strong detection will be useful for identifying hot-core candidates in the LMC. Chemical analysis reveals a spread of more than two orders of magnitude in CH3OH abundances, with some sources deficient in COMs. In contrast, SO2 is detected in all hot cores, and its abundance shows a good correlation with rotational temperature. The hot cores without CH3OH detections are all located outside the LMC bar region and are characterized by either high luminosity or active star formation in their surroundings. A combination of locally low metallicity, active star formation in the vicinity, and high protostellar luminosity may jointly trigger the COM-poor hot core chemistry observed in the LMC.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15964v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Power of DESI for Photometric Redshift Calibration: A Case Study with KiDS-1000</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Diana Blanco, Alexie Leauthaud, Johannes Ulf Lange, Angus Wright, Hendrik Hildebrandt, Sven Heydenreich, Darshika Ravulapalli, Joshua Ratajczak, Kyle Dawson, Jamie McCullough, Biprateep Dey, Chris Blake, Ni Putu Audita Placida Emas, Cristhian Garcia-Quintero, Shahab Joudaki, Alex Krolewski, Anna Porredon, Graziano Rossi, Christoph Saathoff, David Schlegel, Lily Schmassmann, Samantha Y.

In this paper, we study the potential to calibrate photometric redshift (photo-z) distributions for gravitational lensing using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Since beginning its science operations in 2021, DESI has collected more than 50 million redshifts, adding about one million monthly. In addition to its large-scale structure samples, DESI has also acquired over 256k high-quality spectroscopic redshifts (spec-zs) in the COSMOS and XMM and VVDS fields. This is already a factor of 3 larger than previous spec-z calibration compilations in these two regions. Here, we explore calibrating photo-zs for the subset of KiDS-1000 galaxies that fall into joint self-organizing map (SOM) cells overlapping the DESI COSMOS footprint using the DESI COSMOS observations. Estimating the redshift distribution in KiDS-1000 with the new DESI data, we find broad consistency with previously published results while also detecting differences in the mean redshift in some tomographic bins with an average shifts of Delta Mean(z) = -0.028 in the mean and Delta Median(z) = +0.011 in the median across tomographic bins. However, we also find that incompleteness per SOM cell, i.e., groups of galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes, can modify n(z) distributions. Finally, we comment on the fact that larger photometric catalogs, aligned with the DESI COSMOS and DESI XMM and VVDS footprints, would be needed to fully exploit the DESI dataset and would extend the coverage to nearly eight times the area of existing 9-band photometry.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15963v1" target="_blank"><h2>Clustering redshift distribution calibration of weak lensing surveys using the DESI-DR1 spectroscopic dataset</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

We cross-correlate the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) from DESI, within the redshift range $0.1 < z < 1.6$, with overlapping tomographic source samples from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. Using realistic mock catalogues, we test the stability of the clustering-redshift signal to fitting scale, reference-sample choice, and the evolution of source galaxy bias, and we explicitly model and marginalise over magnification contributions, which become non-negligible at $z \gtrsim 1$ due to the depth of the DESI ELG sample. We then compare the resulting bias-weighted redshift distributions to those calibrated using self-organising map (SOM) techniques, finding agreement within uncertainties for all surveys and tomographic bins. Our results demonstrate that clustering redshifts enabled by DESI's unprecedented spectroscopic sample provides a robust, complementary, and independent constraint capable of reducing one of the dominant systematic uncertainties in weak lensing cosmology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15962v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological Constraints from Full-Scale Clustering and Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing with DESI DR1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Johannes U.

We analyze four samples drawn from the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) target classes. Projected galaxy clustering measurements from DESI are supplemented with lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey around the same targets. Our method relies on a simulation-based modeling framework using the AbacusSummit simulations and a complex halo occupation distribution model that incorporates assembly bias. We analyze scales down to $0.4 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ for clustering and $2.5 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ for lensing, leading to stringent constraints on $S_8 = σ_8 \sqrt{Ω_\mathrm{m} / 0.3}$ and $Ω_\mathrm{m}$ when fixing other cosmological parameters to those preferred by the CMB. We find $S_8 = 0.794 \pm 0.023$ and $Ω_\mathrm{m} = 0.295 \pm 0.012$ when using lensing measurements from DES and KiDS. Similarly, for HSC, we find $S_8 = 0.793 \pm 0.017$ and $Ω_\mathrm{m} = 0.303 \pm 0.010$ when assuming the best-fit photometric redshift offset suggested by the HSC collaboration. Overall, our results are in good agreement with other results in the literature while continuing to highlight the constraining power of non-linear scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15961v1" target="_blank"><h2>Joint cosmological fits to DESI-DR1 full-shape clustering and weak gravitational lensing in configuration space</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

We perform our analysis in configuration space and, in addition to the cosmic shear correlation functions for each weak lensing dataset, we fit the tangential shear of the weak lensing source galaxies around DESI lens galaxies. Finally, we make use of the anisotropic BGS and LRG clustering information by fitting the full shape of the two-point correlation function multipoles measured over the full DESI-DR1 footprint, presenting the first full-shape analysis of DESI measurements in configuration space. We find that the addition of weak lensing information serves to improve, with respect to the clustering-only case, the measurements of the power spectrum amplitude parameters $\ln(10^{10}A_{\rm{s}})$ and $σ_{12}$ by $15\%$ and $36\%$, respectively. It also improves measurements of the linear bias of the lens galaxies by $15-20\%$, depending on the tracer. Our results show excellent consistency, regardless of the weak lensing survey considered, and are furthermore consistent with a companion analysis that fits $3\times2$-pt correlations including DESI projected clustering measurements, as well as the results published by the weak lensing collaborations themselves. Our measured values for weak lensing amplitude are $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times HSC}}=0.787\pm0.020$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times DES}}=0.791\pm0.016$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times KiDS}}=0.771\pm0.017$, which are $1.9σ-2.9σ$ below the $S_8$ value preferred by Planck.

This combination of large-scale structure probes allows us to measure a set of $3 \times 2$-pt correlation functions, breaking the degeneracies between parameters in cosmological fits to individual observables. We obtain mutually-consistent constraints on the parameter $S_8 = σ_8 \sqrt{Ω_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.786^{+0.022}_{-0.019}$ from the combination of DESI-DR1 and DES-Y3, $S_8 = 0.760^{+0.020}_{-0.018}$ from KiDS-1000, and $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.026}_{-0.027}$ from HSC-Y3. These parameter determinations are consistent with fits to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background dataset, albeit with $1.5-2σ$ lower values in the $S_8-Ω_{\rm m}$ plane. We perform our analysis with a unified pipeline tailored to the requirements of each cosmic shear survey, which self-consistently determines cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We generate an analytical covariance matrix for the correlation data including all cross-covariances between probes, and we design a new blinding procedure to safeguard our analysis against confirmation bias, whilst leaving goodness-of-fit statistics unchanged.

When current sheets evolve reaching a critical inverse aspect ratio, scaling as $S^{-1/3}$ with the plasma Lundquist number, the so-called \textit{ideal} tearing instability sets in, with modes growing, independently of $S$, extremely rapidly on timescales of only a few light-crossing times of the sheet length. We present the first set of fully 3D simulations of current-sheet disruption triggered by the ideal tearing instability within the resistive relativistic MHD approximation, as appropriate in situations where the Alfvén velocity approaches the speed of light. We compare 3D setups with different initial conditions with their 2D counterparts, and we assess the impact of dimensionality and of the magnetic field topology on the onset, evolution, and efficiency of reconnection. In force-free configurations, 3D runs develop ideal tearing, secondary instabilities, and a thick, turbulent current layer, sustaining dissipation of magnetic energy longer than in 2D. In pressure-balanced current sheets with a null guide field, 2D reference runs show the familiar reconnection dynamics, whereas in 3D tearing dynamics is quenched after the linear phase, as pressure-driven modes growing on forming plasmoids outcompete plasmoid coalescence and suppress fast dissipation of magnetic energy. Taken together, these results suggest that the evolution and efficiency of reconnection depend sensitively on the local plasma conditions and current-sheet configuration, and can be properly captured only in fully 3D simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15911v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Era of Binary Supermassive Black Holes: Coordination of Nanohertz-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Follow-up</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sarah Burke-Spolaor, Tamara Bogdanović, Daniel J.

This paper presents a novel self-consistent implementation of dust formation by stars, destruction by supernova shocks and hot gas, and growth within the dense interstellar medium (ISM) in the GAEA state-of-the-art galaxy formation model. Our new model, DUSTY-GAEA, reproduces well the dust buildup as a function of stellar mass out to z $\sim$ 6, the scaling relations between the dust-to-gas/dust-to-metal ratios and stellar mass/metallicty in the local Universe, and the dust mass function in the local Universe and out to z $\sim$ 1. In the framework of our model, dust growth dominates the cosmic dust budget out to z $\sim$ 8, and we find that observational constraints beyond the local Universe can be reproduced only assuming such efficient dust growth in the dense ISM. Yet, reproducing the estimated number densities of dust-rich galaxies at higher redshifts remains challenging, as found also in independent theoretical work. We discuss our model predictions in comparison with both observational data and independent theoretical efforts, and highlight how further observational constraints at high redshifts would help constrain dust models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15895v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Next Generation Fornax Survey (NGFS).VIII.

Scalable, automated classification is therefore essential to convert the forthcoming data from facilities such as the Vera C. Rubin/LSST, the Roman and Euclid into robust constraints on galaxy assembly. We introduce a supervised classification method to separate GCs, stars, and galaxies based on their locations in color-color diagrams. The main objective is to recover a clean GC sample for future scientific analysis. The method exploits broad spectral energy distribution coverage, deep photometry, and is optimized for next-generation survey volumes. We use the central 3deg2 of the Next Generation Fornax Survey (NGFS), which images the Fornax cluster in u'g'i'JKs. We build a Support Vector Machine (SVM; svm.SVC, scikit-learn) using 15 features: all color combinations and basic morphological parameters. Spectroscopically confirmed sources define the training classes. Color pairs connecting near-UV/optical/near-IR. The full 15 feature model achieves 97.3% accuracy and a pruned 7 feature model built from the most informative, least correlated features achieves 96.6% accuracy. Misclassifications amount 8.4% and 10.4%, respectively. Omitting the u' or/and near-IR bands degrades performance. Emulating LSST filters with NGFS u'g'i' and DES r'z'Y shows that u' and Y bands are crucial, but models lacking NIR remain suboptimal. Combining broad SED coverage with simple morphological parameters enables precise, scalable separation of unresolved sources. Including NIR bands significantly improves GC classification, and joining LSST with forthcoming Euclid and Roman data will further enhance machine-learning frameworks.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15893v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fifty shades of grayness: parameterizations of spectral distortions and applications in cosmology</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gabriela Barenboim, Julien Froustey, Cyril Pitrou, Héctor Sanchis<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 14 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Thermal distribution functions can only be of the Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein types, whereas distorted spectra encompass any possible deviations from these shapes. It is fruitful to devise parameterizations of these distortions with only a few parameters which depend on the physical system considered. A method proposed by Stebbins consists in describing a distorted spectrum as a sum of thermalized spectra with a distribution of temperatures, the moments of which are the parameters of interest. After revisiting and extending this approach by working at the level of the number density distribution instead of the standard spectrum, we build another method which consists in describing the distorted spectrum by a polynomial modulating a reference thermalized spectrum. The distortion parameters are then the coefficients of a decomposition on a suitable orthonormal polynomial basis. We advocate that the latter is computationally easier and allows to describe a wide range of distortions. With this formalism, we efficiently describe the standard distortions of the cosmological backgrounds of neutrinos and photons, and we obtain model-independent constraints on nonstandard distortions of these cosmological relics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15886v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cored galaxies in cuspy dark matter halos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fernando Valenciano, Jorge Martin Camalich, Arianna Di Cintio, Julio F.

Our aim is to clarify under what conditions cored stellar profiles require dark matter halos that are also cored, deviating from the cuspy profiles expected for cold dark matter halos. We consider a variety of spherically symmetric stellar profiles, which we classify as "strong" or "weak" cores and cusps according to the behavior of the slope ($b_0$) and logarithmic slope ($γ_0$) at their centers. We explore which profiles lead to unphysical negative distribution functions when embedded in a cuspy halo, treating isotropic and anisotropic kinematics separately. We find that weakly-cored stellar profiles in 3D (i.e., $b_0 \neq 0$, $γ_0=0$) can be consistent with cuspy dark matter profiles, but strong 3D cores ($b_0=γ_0=0$) are not. However, both weak and strong 3D cores yield nearly indistinguishable inner profiles in projection, which implies that ruling out a dark matter cusp from photometric data alone is highly challenging. As an example, we study the profiles of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and find that they are consistent with both weak and strong 3D cores. This is not just a result of the limited numbers of stars in these systems, since we reach the same conclusion even for Fornax, one of the most luminous and best-studied dwarf spheroidal companions of the Milky Way. We conclude that, based on current data and analysis techniques, cored surface density profiles in nearby dwarf galaxies cannot be taken as strong evidence against the presence of cuspy dark matter halos.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15883v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AIDA-TNG project: abundance, radial distribution, and clustering properties of halos in alternative dark matter models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Massimiliano Romanello, Giulia Despali, Federico Marulli, Carlo Giocoli, Lauro Moscardini<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A.

In this paper, we use the dark matter-only runs of the \textsc{aida-tng} project, a set of cosmological simulations of different sizes and resolutions, to analyze the macroscopic impact of alternative dark matter models on the abundance, the radial distribution and the clustering properties of halos. We adopt the halo occupation distribution formalism to characterize the evolution of its parameters $M_1$ and $α$ with the mass and redshift selection of our sample. By dividing the halo population into central and satellites, we are able to study their spatial density profile, finding that a Navarro-Frenk-White model is not accurate enough to describe the radial distribution of subhalos, and that a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White model is required instead. Warm dark matter models, in particular, present a cuspier distribution of satellites, whereas self-interacting dark matter exhibits a shallower density profile. Moreover, we find that the small-scale clustering of dark matter halos provides a powerful tool to discriminate between alternative dark matter scenarios, in preparation for a more detailed study that fully incorporates baryonic effects, and for a comparison with observational data from galaxy clustering.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15881v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shedding the envelope: JWST reveals a kiloparsec-scale [OIII]-weak Balmer shell around a z=7.64 quasar</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Julien Wolf, Eduardo Bañados, Xiaohui Fan, Antoine Dumont, James E.

Fully characterizing the symbiotic evolution of SMBHs and hosts requires rest-frame optical observations that span spatial scales from the broad-line region to the ISM and CGM. JWST now provides the necessary spatially resolved spectroscopy to do so. But the physical conditions that regulate the interplay between SMBHs and their hosts at the highest redshifts, especially the nature of early feedback phases, remain unclear. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of J0313$-$1806 at z=7.64, the most distant luminous quasar known.
  From the restframe optical spectrum of the unresolved quasar, we derive a black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=(1.63 \pm 0.10)\times10^9 M_\odot$ based on H$β$ and an Eddington rate of $λ=L/L_\mathrm{Edd}=0.80\pm 0.05$, consistent with previous MgII-based estimates. J0313-1806 exhibits no detectable [O III] emission on nuclear scales. Most remarkably, we detect an ionized gas shell extending out to $\sim 1.8$ kpc traced by H$β$ emission that also lacks any significant [O III], with a $3σ$ upper limit on the [O III]$ λ$5007 to H$β$ flux ratio of $\log_{10} \left( F(\mathrm{[OIII]})/F(\mathrm{H}β)\right)=-1.15$.
  Through photoionization modelling, we demonstrate that the extended emission is consistent with a thin, clumpy outflowing shell where [OIII] is collisionally de-excited by dense gas. We interpret this structure as a fossil remnant of a recent blowout phase, providing evidence for episodic feedback cycles in one of the earliest quasars. These findings suggest that dense ISM phases may play a crucial role in shaping the spectral properties of quasars accross cosmic time.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15877v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling the frequency-domain ringdown amplitude of comparable-mass mergers with greybody factors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Romeo Felice Rosato, Sophia Yi, Emanuele Berti, Paolo Pani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It was recently shown that, in a binary coalescence, the greybody factor of the remnant black hole modulates the post-merger ringdown signal.

The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations (2025a, arXiv:2508.18083) report that the spin-orbit tilt distribution of mergers in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 exhibits a global peak at near-perpendicular directions $\cosθ_{1(2)}\approx0$. Here, we recover this feature using hierarchical Bayesian inference with parametric models that are tailored to enhance the diagnostic power about astrophysical formation channels. We find that the spin distribution of the low-mass bulk of the binary black hole merger population $(m_1\lesssim 44.3^{+8.7}_{-4.6}\,\rm M_\odot)$ can be well-modelled by a dominant Gaussian component that peaks at $\cosθ_{1(2)}\approx0$, possibly mixed with a subdominant isotropic component. Models that include a component with spins preferentially aligned with the orbit are disfavoured by current data (with Bayes factors $|Δ\ln\mathcal{B}|\approx1$ to $3$) and constrain its contribution to be small ($ξ\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\,\%$). If these findings are reinforced by more detections, they would challenge any major contribution from the traditional isolated-binary formation scenario yielding closely aligned spins. Instead, the dominant component with near-perpendicular spins qualitatively matches expectations from the evolution of isolated massive stellar triples in the galactic field, where the Lidov-Kozai effect naturally produces a unique overabundance of mergers with $\cosθ_{1(2)}\approx0$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15870v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Acoustic Oscillations as an Early-Universe Explanation of the DESI Anomaly</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mathias Garny, Florian Niedermann, Martin S.

Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD). The presence of a DAO feature close to the BAO peak can be scrutinized with future full-shape galaxy clustering data from DESI and Euclid.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15869v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AIDA-TNG project: dark matter profiles and concentrations in alternative dark matter models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Giulia Despali, Carlo Giocoli, Lauro Moscardini, Annalisa Pillepich, Mark Vogelsberger, Massimo Meneghetti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 12 figures, submitted to A&A.

Alternative scenarios, such as warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), modify the inner structure of haloes and predict different profile shapes and central slopes. We employ the AIDA-TNG simulations to investigate how alternative dark matter physics and baryonic processes jointly shape the internal structure of haloes. Using dark-matter-only and full-physics runs, we measure the dark matter density profiles of haloes spanning six orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^9.5 Msun to 10^14.5 Msub, and characterise them with multiple analytical models. We provide the distribution of the best-fitting parameters, as well as the concentration-mass relation in WDM and SIDM. The Einasto profile well reproduces the inner flattening produced in WDM models, both in the collisionless and in the full-physics runs. In SIDM dark-matter-only runs, haloes are better described by explicitly cored profiles, with core sizes that depend on mass and on the self-interaction model. When baryons are included, the differences between CDM and SIDM decrease, and such large dark-matter cores no longer form because adiabatic contraction in the baryon-dominated region counteracts self-interactions. Nevertheless, the coupling between baryons and self-interactions induces a broader range of inner slopes, including cases that are steeper than CDM at Milky Way masses. Alternative dark matter physics thus leaves clear signatures in the inner halo structure, even if baryons significantly reshape these differences. Our results are useful for future studies that need to predict the properties of haloes in multiple dark matter models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15856v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AIDA-TNG project: 3D halo shapes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> C.

The shapes of dark matter halos can be used to constrain the fundamental properties of dark matter. In standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies, halos are typically triaxial, with a preference for prolate configurations, particularly at low masses and high redshift. Aims. We focus on the characterization of total matter 3D shape in alternative dark matter models, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). These scenarios predict different structural properties due to collisional effects or the suppression of small-scale power. Methods. We measure the different halo component shapes - dark matter, stars and gas - at various radii from the center in the AIDA-TNG (Alternative Interacting Dark Matter and Astrophysics - TNG), which is a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations built upon the IllustrisTNG framework. The intent is to systematically study how different dark matter models - specifically, SIDM and WDM - affect galaxy formation and the structure of dark matter halos, when realistic baryonic physics is also included. Results. SIDM models tend to produce rounder and more isotropic halos, especially in the inner regions, as a result of momentum exchange between dark matter particles. WDM halos are also slightly more spherical than their CDM counterparts, and are typically less concentrated. In all cases, the inclusion of self-consistent baryonic physics makes the central regions of all halos rounder, while still revealing clear distinctions among the various dark matter models. Conclusions. The general framework presented in this work, based on the 3D halo shape, can be useful to interpret multi-wavelength data analyses of galaxies and clusters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15853v1" target="_blank"><h2>From "The Cliff" to "Virgil": Mapping the Spectral Diversity of Little Red Dots with JWST/NIRSpec</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guillermo Barro, Pablo G.

Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population-wide analysis of their UV--optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9\,$μ$m]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes ($β_{ν,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 0.3$) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes ($β_{ν,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 1.1$). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, $\sim$60% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H$_α$/H$_β$ and low [OIII]$\lambda5007$/H$_β$ in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15846v1" target="_blank"><h2>GRHayL: a modern, infrastructure-agnostic, extensible library for GRMHD simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Samuel Cupp, Leonardo R.

We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable pointwise and stencil-wise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and CarpetX) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron-star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15847v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-confinement of relativistic pair beams in magnetized interstellar plasmas: the case of pulsar X-ray filaments</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Luca Orusa, Lorenzo Sironi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, physics.plasm-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 6 figures.

The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven -- via the non-resonant streaming instability -- by electron--positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron--proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15849v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological Neutron Stars Produce Diffuse Axion X-Ray Signatures</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Orion Ning, Kailash Raman, Benjamin R.

If they are ultralight ($m_a \lesssim 10^{-4}$ eV), then they can efficiently convert to detectable photons in the external NS magnetospheres, and if they are heavy ($m_a \gtrsim 1$ eV), then they can decay into photons before reaching Earth. In this work, we search for the resulting X-ray signatures from both of these channels summing over the $\textit{cosmological}$ NS population. We compare the predicted axion-induced X-ray signal to the cosmic X-ray background today as measured by a number of instruments such as NuSTAR, HEAO, Swift, and INTEGRAL. We model the axion-induced signal using NS cooling simulations and magnetic field evolution models. We find no evidence for axions and derive strong constraints for both ultralight and heavy axion scenarios, covering new parameter space for the axion-photon and axion-nucleon couplings. Our results rule out the axion-explanation of the Magnificent Seven X-ray excess from nearby isolated NSs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15704v1" target="_blank"><h2>Physical Effects of Gravitational Waves at Second Order <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guillem Domènech, Shi Pi, Ao Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 1 figure<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15841v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxies as stochastic systems: why the next breakthrough in galaxy evolution requires one hundred million spectra</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sandro Tacchella, Vasily Belokurov, Harry T.

To move beyond descriptive scaling relations toward physical regulation mechanisms of star formation, quenching, chemical enrichment and black hole growth, galaxies must be treated as realizations of a stochastic process whose hyper-parameters (e.g., correlation timescales, burstiness, duty cycles) are inferred hierarchically. This demands both depth and scale: continuum S/N sufficient for absorption-line ages and chemistry, and samples far larger than those in SDSS, DESI, 4MOST or MOONS, which provide either depth or size but not both across $0<z<3$. Once the relevant axes of mass, redshift, environment, structure and evolutionary phase are populated, the requirement naturally rises from $10^7$ to $\sim10^8$ galaxies. This is the regime where stochastic hyper-parameters can be well constrained and where comparisons to simulations and cosmological forward models become limited by theory rather than observations. We outline the science enabled by such a programme and the corresponding requirements for a future ESO wide-field spectroscopic facility capable of delivering tens to hundreds of millions of rest-UV-optical spectra over $0\lesssim z\lesssim3$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15836v1" target="_blank"><h2>What Builds and Quenches the Most Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mengyuan Xiao, Longji Bing, Guilaine Lagache, Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky, Olivier Ilbert, Benjamin Magnelli, Pascal A.

Current surveys lack the wide-field, rest-frame FIR sensitivity needed to obtain a complete census of massive systems and to trace their cold gas, dust, and diffuse emission on galactic and circumgalactic scales. A next-generation facility with a very large aperture, wide field of view, and high mapping speed is essential to carry out deep, degree-scale rest-frame FIR surveys. Such capabilities are required to determine how common massive galaxies are, how they assemble their baryons, and what physical processes drive their early transformation and quenching.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15660v1" target="_blank"><h2>The longest known tails of ram-pressure stripped star-forming galaxies are caused by an ICM shock in Abell 1367</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> H.

We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073 and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyze LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817 and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We find that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths $\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($α\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall which propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15832v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accretion and Ejection Physics at High Time Resolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

Along with this, accretion has also a key impact on the evolution of the Universe, through the launch of powerful outflows that affect the surrounding medium. In the last years sub-second optical-infrared observations of accreting X-ray binaries have opened a new window in the study of inflow-outflow connection, discovering a wide range of previously unkown phenomena. Here we review the key open questions in accretion and ejection physics and discuss how a dedicated facility, equipped with photon-counting detectors and high spectral resolution from the UV to the mid-infrared, can enable transformative advances in our understanding of accretion processes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15637v1" target="_blank"><h2>The impact of bars on the properties of HII regions in the TIMER survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Laura Sánchez-Menguiano, Dimitri A.

Based on integral field spectroscopy data for 17 barred galaxies covering approximately the central 6x6 kpc, we detect a total of 2200 HII regions, of which 331 are located within the nuclear disc (also known as circumnuclear regions), 661 in the bar region, and 1208 in the disc. Among the physical properties of the HII regions, we explore the O/H and N/O abundances, H$α$ luminosity, dust extinction, electron density, and H$α$ equivalent width. We find clear differences in the properties of the HII regions between the nuclear disc, the bar and the disc, that could be explained by an enhancement in the molecular gas concentration in the central parts driven by bar-induced gas flows. As this gas is channelled towards the galaxy centre, the most extreme values in the analysed properties are found for the circumnuclear HII regions. Unlike the bar strength, galaxy mass does seem to affect the properties of the HII regions, with massive galaxies presenting higher values in most of the properties, possibly due to the increased amount of gas in these systems. This study provides evidence that the bar-driven redistribution of material within the galaxy inner parts causes significant differences in the HII region properties depending on their location within the galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 67 papers (66 new, 1 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
