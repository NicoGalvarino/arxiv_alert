Comparatively, nebulae associated with obscured AGN are less studied. Here, we
simulate the Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and HeII nebulae around the two types of
AGN at $z=2-3$ with ten massive systems from the FIRE simulations based on the
unified model to show their differences and to test if they can be used to
constrain the AGN model. We post-process the data with the CLOUDY and the
Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer code, RASCAS. Overall, we find that the
Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around the unobscured AGN (type-I nebulae) and obscured AGN
(type-II nebulae) do not exhibit significant differences in the luminosity,
area, and HeII/Ly$\alpha$ when the simulated cutout is set to the halo virial
radius. Whereas, the type-II nebulae exhibit less symmetric morphologies,
flatter surface brightness profiles, and larger emission line widths (at $R\geq
10$ kpc) than those of the type-I nebulae. These nebulae properties exhibit
complicated correlations with the AGN, indicating that nebulae observations can
be applied to constrain the AGN engine. However, independent observations on
nebulae in the mentioned emissions are insufficient to test the unified model
as a priori in observations is not possible to know the direction and opening
angle of the ionization cone. We prompt that the joint observations of
Ly$\alpha$ nebulae and radio jets can help to reveal the ionization cone to
probe the unified model. Our calculations suggest that this method requires
$\geq 75$ type-II Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with current instruments to reach a
confidence level of $\geq 95\%$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19581v1" target="_blank"><h2>Efficient semi-analytic modelling of Pop III star formation from Cosmic

from hopes to identify their signatures in their heyday at cosmic dawn to deep
searches for their remnants in our local neighborhood. Such work crucially
relies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect
pristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we
introduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently
trace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first
billion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out
of pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest
theoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular
cooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal
models for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the
processes - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while
remaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap
between numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we
self-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo
era through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical
conditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence
of Pop II star formation down to $z\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive
halos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics
underpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this
uncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently
bracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we
leverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating
forecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm
global signal.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20687v1" target="_blank"><h2>Do Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Follow the Globular Cluster-Halo Mass
  Relation?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Duncan A. Forbes, Jonah S.

mass relation are two scaling relations that relate fundamental properties of
normal galaxies. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), some of which, have rich GC
systems and relatively low stellar masses can not follow the mean trend of both
relations simultaneously; it is thus important to understand which relationship
is followed by UDGs. Using independent halo masses determined from kinematic
fitting to large radii, we identify three UDGs and two UDG-like galaxies from
the literature and examine which scaling relation they follow. We find that the
galaxies follow the GC number-halo mass relation but deviate in a systematic
way from the stellar mass-halo mass relation, which depends on their GC count.
This scatter off the relation is towards higher halo masses, or equivalently
lower stellar masses. The galaxies exhibiting the largest offsets may represent
`failed galaxies' that have experienced quenched star formation with later
assembly.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20684v1" target="_blank"><h2>A deep dive down the broad-line region: permitted OI, CaII and FeII

(AGN) selected as little red dot at $z = 5.3$ behind the Bullet cluster
(Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII,
OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer
lines, provides unambiguous evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an
accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of
the $\lambda1304$ bump (i.e., blend of OI$\lambda$1304 and SiII) at high
redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the
early Universe. The OI$\lambda$1304/$\lambda8446$ photon ratio is highly
suppressed (0.1-0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with
estimated dust attenuation $A_V \sim 0.4$-$1.0$. We identify Ly$\beta$
fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines,
with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OI$\lambda$8446
equivalent width and weak OI$\lambda$7774 support this interpretation. The
detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden
lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in
local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OI$\lambda$8446 and CaII further
suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and
ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a
rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20989v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the Neutral Fraction of the Warm Ionized Medium via [NI] 5200</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S.

Kausch, Soumyadeep Bhattacharjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages; 18 figures; 3 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Most of the ionized mass in the Milky Way is in the Warm Ionized Medium (WIM)
and not in the bright H~II regions. The WIM is traced by dispersion measure and
has been extensively studied in recombination lines (primarily, H$\alpha$) and
optical nebular lines (primarily, S+ and N+). The observations can be well
explained by a photo-ionized nebula with a low ionization parameter. It is
generally thought that the source of ionization (and heating) of the WIM is due
to Lyman continuum leaking from HII regions which are concentrated in the
Galactic plane. The rays of the diffuse Galactic Lyman-continuum radiation
field incident on the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) are absorbed, forming an
ionized skin. In nebulae with low-ionization parameter the transition from
ionized gas to neutral gas is gradual, unlike the case for HII regions with
their sharp Stromgren spheres. The transition region is warm enough to excite
oxygen and nitrogen atoms to emit [OI] 6300,6363 and [NI] 5198,5200. Domgorgen
& Mathis (1994) recognized the value of [OI] 6300 as a diagnostic of the
fraction of the diffuse continuum that is absorbed by the WNM and therefore
constrains the fraction of the diffuse Lyman continuum that escapes to the
halo. Unfortunately, observations of Galactic [OI] 6300 have been stymied by
bright [OI] 6300 airglow emission. [NI] 5200,5198 has been a historically less
popular probe because this doublet is less luminous than the oxygen doublet.
However, we point out that the [NI] airglow is two orders of magnitude smaller
than that of [OI]. Furthermore, even in the presence of comparable airglow, the
WIM [NI] emission can be inferred using the doublet intensity ratio for which a
medium-resolution spectrometer such as the Local Volume Mapper will suffice.
Separately, we note, in extragalactic systems, that [OI]6300/[NI]5200 is a
robust measure of the O/N abundance ratio.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20305v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> stellar mass function (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images
separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of
$2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such
micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast
radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time
delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens
populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed
(macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of
stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second
(dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range
reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum
macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar
population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${>}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas
the secondary population leads to peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to
differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar
density introduces new peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the
inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we
also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the
autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function,
allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB
microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing
to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed
studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only
discussed qualitatively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20190v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interpreting nebular emission lines in the high-redshift Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aswin P.

UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe ($z
\geq 5$), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer
conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we evaluate the
reliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star
formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the
gas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from
idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to
assess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying
stellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy
nature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age,
metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these
diagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be
underestimated by as much as $30 \%$ compared to the true values. Similarly,
the true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost
constant with stellar mass, while estimates using H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ can
underestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end ($>10^{9.5}$
M$_{\odot}$), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES
mass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a
flat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong
positive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of
understanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry
and heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines
at high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy
spectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic
star-dust geometry and population variations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20744v1" target="_blank"><h2>Temperature based radial metallicity gradients in nearby galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  K.

gradients and 2D metallicity distributions tracking how metals build up and
redistribute within galaxy disks over cosmic time. We use a catalog of 22,958
HII regions across 19 nearby spiral galaxies to examine how precisely the
radial abundance gradients can be traced using only the [NII]5755 electron
temperature as a proxy for `direct method' metallicities. Using 534 direct
detections of the temperature sensitive [NII]5755 auroral line, we measure
gradients in 15 of the galaxies. Leveraging our large catalog of individual HII
regions, we stack in bins of HII region [NII]6583 luminosity and radius to
recover stacked radial gradients. We find good agreement between the
metallicity gradients from the stacked spectra, those gradients from individual
regions and those from strong line methods. In addition, particularly in the
stacked Te([NII]) measurements, some galaxies show very low (<0.05 dex) scatter
in metallicities, indicative of a well-mixed ISM. We examine individual high
confidence (S/N > 5) outliers and identify 13 regions across 9 galaxies with
anomalously low metallicity, although this is not strongly reflected in the
strong line method metallicities. By stacking arm and interarm regions, we find
no systematic evidence for offsets in metallicity between these environments,
suggesting enrichment within spiral arms is due to very localized processes.
This work demonstrates the potential to systematically exploit the single
[NII]5755 auroral line for detailed gas-phase abundance studies of galaxies. It
provides strong validation of previous results, based on the strong line
calibrations, of a well-mixed ISM across typical star-forming spiral galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20606v1" target="_blank"><h2>Beyond Extreme Burstiness: Evolving Star Formation Efficiency as the Key

Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at $z
\geq 9$, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within
standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a
semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV
luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation
efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint
Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined
HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information
criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift
evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\alpha(z)$ while maintaining
other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent
agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\sigma_{\rm UV}
= 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by
previous studies for $z > 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated
by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\alpha$ increasing toward
higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during
cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important
observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift
range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\sim
20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be
reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest
stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme
burstiness or exotic mechanisms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19573v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observed Timescales of Stellar Feedback in Star-Forming, Low-Mass

formation histories (SFHs) -- derived from color-magnitude diagrams -- with
kinematic data of the atomic and ionized hydrogen in a large sample of nearby,
star-forming, low-mass galaxies. To best understand the timescales involved,
SFHs and gas kinematics were analyzed in 400$\times$400 parsec regions to
capture the local impacts of star formation. No strong correlation was found
between the ionized gas velocity dispersion and the star formation activity
over the past 5-500 Myr. In contrast, a consistent and significant correlation
between the atomic hydrogen turbulence measures and the star formation activity
t$\geq$100 Myr ago was identified. This correlation suggests the star formation
activity and atomic gas are coupled on this timescale. This connection between
star-formation activity $>$100 Myr ago, and the HI turbulence properties, may
be related to the time scales over which turbulence decays in the ISM.
Additionally, the results demonstrate a possible difference in the global and
local turbulence properties of low-mass galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19651v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological observational tests in the JWST Era I: angular size -

driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance
star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish
observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies
with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we
cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan
Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as
well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN
activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies
are 10.3$\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\pm$5.0
times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a
mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes,
galaxies with \textit{arm} features are 1.4$\pm$0.2 times more likely to be
starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell}
features are 2.7$\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a
similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and
find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without
tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an
important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and
provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect
has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the

a quiescent state (quenching) is paramount to our understanding of galaxy
evolution. One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a
galaxy's interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or
environmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in
action, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite
galaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local
Universe is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining
environments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new
environmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible
Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at
intermediate redshift (0.3$<$z$<$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And
Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$<$z$<$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy
properties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an
identical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite
galaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to
isolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\sim$0.5dex in
log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in
higher mass dark matter halos (up to $\sim$1dex in
log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that
at fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with
satellite passive fractions increasing by $\sim$10-15\% over the last

galactic nucleus (AGN) wind in elliptical galaxies based on our two-dimensional
axisymmetric hydrodynamic $\textit{MACER}$ numerical simulations. Using these
simulation data, we calculate the synchrotron radiation produced by nonthermal
electrons accelerated at shocks, adopting reasonable assumptions for the
magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution (derived from diffusive
shock acceleration theory), and predict the resulting observational signatures.
In our fiducial model, shocks driven by AGN winds produce synchrotron emission
with luminosities of approximately $10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}$ in
the radio band (0.5-5 GHz), with spectral indices of $\alpha \approx -0.4$ to
$-0.6$ during the strongest shock phases, gradually steepening to about $-0.8$
to $-1.4$ as the electron population ages. Spatially, the emission is initially
concentrated in regions of strong shocks, later expanding into more extended,
diffuse structures. We also apply our model to the dwarf elliptical galaxy
Messier 32 (M32), and find remarkable consistency between our simulated
emission and the observed nuclear radio source, suggesting that this radio
component likely originates from hot-wind-driven shocks. Our results indicate
that AGN winds not only influence galaxy gas dynamics through mechanical energy

crucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep
knowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such
as those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable
only in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\mathrm{e}$ over
large areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical
models. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace
$f_\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this
study, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the
ionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense
and translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the
far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the
ionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and
$10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to
$G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume
density ($f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\mathrm{e} \propto
n^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas,
differing line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of
electron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the
CN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and
C$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments,
CCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in
translucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense
gas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20780v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along

(synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient
plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting
at ~GHz frequencies to t<100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz
factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed
of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$)
Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed,
$v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting
electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the
underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a
few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another
form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments
with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg
v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without
re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments,
electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their
velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal
plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure
gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break
frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as
$P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized.
While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and
narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective
appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still
providing channels for electrons' propagation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19706v1" target="_blank"><h2>MINERVA: A NIRCam Medium Band and MIRI Imaging Survey to Unlock the

  Power- and Bispectra</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jonas Frugte, P. Daniel Meerburg</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 39 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid,
are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power
spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data,
non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional
cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of
future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing
power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their
cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum
m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In
the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found
to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one
based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization
anisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior,
the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking
degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for
the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the
bispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also
find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads
to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found
that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation,
so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions
remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing
statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian
covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20232v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Systematic Search for AGN Flares in ZTF Data Release 23</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lei He, Zheng-Yan Liu, Rui Niu, Ming-Shen Zhou, Pu-Run Zou, Bing-Zhou Gao, Run-Duo Liang, Liang-Gui Zhu, Jian-Min Wang, Ning Jiang, Zhen-Yi Cai, Ji-an Jiang, Zi-Gao Dai, Ye-Fei Yuan, Yong-Jie Chen, Wen Zhao</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 18 figures, comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability

of these candidates as SNRs based on evidence of linear polarization or through
the calculation of nonthermal spectral indices. Additionally, we identify
possible radio counterparts for seven SNR candidates that were previously only
identified in X-rays (four) or optical (three). We also present six new SNRs

former catalog provides more accurate mass estimation, while the Yang21 makes
under-estimation of halo mass for those sharing the central galaxy with

application of classical methods for estimating galaxy properties challenging
and time-consuming. This challenge can be significantly alleviated by employing
automatic machine and deep learning techniques. We propose an implementation of
the ULISSE algorithm aimed at determining physical parameters of galaxies, in
particular star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$), using
only composite-color images. ULISSE is able to rapidly and efficiently identify
candidates from a single image based on photometric and morphological
similarities to a given reference object with known properties. This approach
leverages features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform similarity
searches among all objects in the sample, eliminating the need for extensive
neural network training. Our experiments, performed on the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, demonstrate that we are able to predict the joint star formation rate
and stellar mass of the target galaxies within 1 dex in 60% to 80% of cases,
depending on the investigated subsample (quiescent/star-forming galaxies,
early-/late-type, etc.), and within 0.5 dex if we consider these parameters
separately. This is approximately twice the fraction obtained from a random
guess extracted from the parent population. Additionally, we find ULISSE is
more effective for galaxies with active star formation compared to elliptical
galaxies with quenched star formation. Additionally, ULISSE performs more
efficiently for galaxies with bright nuclei such as AGN. Our results suggest
that ULISSE is a promising tool for a preliminary estimation of star-formation
rates and stellar masses for galaxies based only on single images in current
and future wide-field surveys (e.g., Euclid, LSST), which target millions of

consistent with zero. Based on recent advancements in the measurement of the

between these two independent mass inference techniques for 46 galaxy clusters
between $0.05 \le z \le 0.3$ and over an order of magnitude in mass, $14.4 \le

the two mass measurements consistent with zero (0.02 $\pm$ 0.02 dex). The
observed scatter between these direct mass estimates is 0.17 dex and is

indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy at a significance level above
$2.5 \sigma$, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) combined with cosmic
microwave background (CMB) data and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data, favoring a
time dependent equation of state $w(z)$ rather than the cosmological constant
($w = -1$). We introduce the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, in which dark
energy arises from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge group,
developing dynamically through non perturbative interactions. Governed by an
inverse power law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE
features no dark energy free parameters: one less than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$)
and three less than the $ w_{0}w_{a} $CDM ($ w_{0}, w_{a},\Lambda $) models. By
integrating DESI BAO measurements, CMB data and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia
distance data collected during the fifth year, BDE demonstrates a reduction of
$42$ and $37$ percent in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ as well as lower AIC and
BIC values compared to the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models,
respectively, while maintaining a comparable fit for both type Ia supernovae
and the cosmic microwave background data. Although the ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour
in BDE is 10,000 times smaller than that found in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model,
the BDE model suggests a dynamical dark energy scenario with precise values of
$w_{0}=$-0.9301 $\pm$ 0.0004 and $w_{a}=$ -0.8085 $\pm$ 0.0053 while providing
a consistency on the six Planck and derived parameters at the 1$\sigma$ level

this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the

investigate the effects of a parametrized model of the convective process,

the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of

Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models

future observations such as XRISM will provide further details on less
constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosion. Future
comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further
shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological

observables in physics, can paradoxically lead to large deviations in the
inferred parameters of interest -- a bias known as volume projection effects --
when marginalising over many nuisance parameters. For posterior distributions
that admit a Laplace expansion, we show that this artefact of Bayesian
inference can be mitigated by defining expectation values with respect to a
non-flat volume measure, such that the posterior mean becomes unbiased on
average. We begin by finding a measure that ensures the mean is an unbiased
estimator of the mode. Although the mode itself, as we rediscover, is biased
under sample averaging, this choice yields the least biased estimator due to a
cancellation we clarify. We further explain why bias in marginal posteriors can
appear relatively large, yet remains correctable, when the number of nuisances
is large. To demonstrate our approach, we present mock analyses in large-scale
structure (LSS) wherein cosmological parameters are subject to large projection
effects (at the 1-2$\sigma$ level) under a flat measure, that are however
recovered at high fidelity ($<0.1\sigma$) when estimated using non-flat

the cosmic dipole inferred from galaxy number counts and that derived from the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a potential deviation from the
cosmological principle. This work investigates whether superhorizon
isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this
discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at
leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB
dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining
the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum
cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law
spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the
axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the
resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current
CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated
potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} < \lambda < 4 \times 10^{-9}$.

positional and velocity information of member galaxies to predict residual

  model-independent emulation of one-loop galaxy power spectra</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alexander Reeves, Pierre Zhang, Henry Zheng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 + 14 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ code is available atthis https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a differentiable, $\texttt{JAX}$-based
implementation of $\texttt{PyBird}$, using internal neural network emulators to
accelerate computationally costly operations for rapid large-scale structure
(LSS) analysis. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ computes one-loop EFTofLSS predictions
for redshift-space galaxy power spectrum multipoles in 1.2 ms on a CPU and 0.2
ms on a GPU, achieving 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-up over $\texttt{PyBird}$.
The emulators take a compact spline-based representation of the input linear
power spectrum $P(k)$ as feature vectors, making the approach applicable to a
wide range of cosmological models. We rigorously validate its accuracy against
large-volume simulations and on BOSS data, including cosmologies not explicitly
represented in the training set. Leveraging automatic differentiation,
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ supports Fisher forecasting, Taylor expansion of model
predictions, gradient-based searches, and vectorised ensemble sampling.
Interfaced with a variety of samplers and Boltzmann solvers,
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ provides a high-performance, end-to-end inference
pipeline. Combined with a symbolic-$P(k)$ generator, a typical Stage-4 LSS MCMC
converges in minutes on a GPU. Our results demonstrate that
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ delivers the precision and speed required for upcoming
LSS surveys, opening the door to accelerated cosmological inference with
minimal accuracy loss and no pretraining. In a companion paper [1], we put
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ to use in achieving LSS marginalised constraints free
from volume projection effects through non-flat measures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18946v1" target="_blank"><h2>Refined Constraints on the Hubble Constant from Localized FRBs with

A cross-listing to astro-ph.CO is kindly requested due to the relevance to cosmological parameter constraints</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The dispersion measure-redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides
a valuable cosmological probe for constraining the Hubble constant, offering an
independent measurement that could help resolve the ongoing Hubble tension. In
this paper, we begin with a sample of 117 localized FRBs and use 95 of them to
constrain $H_0$ to $71.28^{+1.90}_{-2.08}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ within the
standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The resulting
statistical uncertainty is below 2.8\%, improving previous FRB-based
measurements and highlighting the promise of larger future samples. Beyond
statistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been
adopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To
address this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling
uncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic
electron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such
as FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter
selections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of
uncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as
reliable cosmological tools.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20012v1" target="_blank"><h2>Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity and the Mass-Dimension Field
  Equation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gabriele U. Varieschi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, including 6 figures. Seventh paper on NFDG</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We resume our analysis of Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity (NFDG), an
alternative gravitational model which does not require the Dark Matter (DM)
paradigm. We add three more galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 3198, NGC 2841) to the
catalog of those studied with NFDG methods. Once again, NFDG can successfully
reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension
$D\left (R\right )$, as was done for nine other galaxies previously studied
with these methods.
  In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model,
which is capable of deriving the fractional mass-dimension $D_{m}\left( R
\right)$ from first principles, as opposed to the previous $D\left (R\right )$
which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data
for each galaxy. While the NFDG predictions computed with this new
$D_{m}\left(R\right)$ dimension are not as accurate as those based on the
original $D\left (R\right )$, they nevertheless confirm the validity of our
fractional-dimension approach. Three previously studied galaxies (NGC 7814, NGC
6503, NGC 3741) were analyzed again with these new methods and their structure
was confirmed to be free from any dark matter components.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20659v1" target="_blank"><h2>Maximal parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton
  asymmetries</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kensuke Akita, Koichi Hamaguchi, Maksym Ovchynnikov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5+25 pages, 1+10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large lepton flavor asymmetries with zero total lepton asymmetry could be
generated in the Early Universe. They are loosely constrained by current
observations, being washed out at MeV temperatures by neutrino oscillations. We
show that such lepton flavor asymmetries open up a new parameter space for
sterile neutrino dark matter, consistent with all observational bounds. To this
end, we construct the semi-classical Boltzmann equation for sterile neutrinos
applicable in the case of arbitrarily large lepton asymmetries, and confirm its
validity by quantum kinetic equations. This way, we derive the maximal
parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries. The
allowed range of sterile neutrinos' squared couplings extends by up to two
orders of magnitude across a 5-70 keV mass range, and may be testable by X-ray,
structure formation, and upcoming CMB observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20323v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ke Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 3 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM)
solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the
Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$.
Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational
waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate
its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of
GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very
small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge
$\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently,
this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small
antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background,
even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing
arrays today.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21041v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on

Submitted to Astrophysical Journal on Jun 12 2025, accepted on Jul 25 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), LLS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark
matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the
variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls
into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to
trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH
orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by
the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing
thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as
the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study
the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and
nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves
which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our
models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without
involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.</p></br></body>
