surveys could represent a key co-evolutionary phase from nuclear to
circum-galactic (CG) scales in the formation of massive galaxies. In this
context, Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) at z ~2-4 provide a unique
opportunity to study the link between cosmic mass assembly and nuclear
accretion in high-z luminous QSOs/galaxies. W0410-0913 (hereafter W0410-09) is
a luminous ($\rm ~L_{\rm bol} \sim 6.4 \times10^{47} \rm erg\ s^{-1}$) obscured
QSO at z = 3.631, with a 30 kpc CG Ly$\alpha$ nebula (CGLAN), smaller than the
~ 100 kpc nebulae around unobscured Type-I QSOs, and an exceptional overdense
environment of ~ 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) within 300 kpc and $\pm$ 200
$\rm km ~s^{-1}$ of the Hot DOG. We aim to detect and characterize nuclear
accretion in W0410-09 and its environment. Exploiting a deep proprietary ~280
ks Chandra observation, using empirical and physically motivated models for
obscured sources, we show that W0410-09 exhibits Compton-thick obscuration
($\rm~ N_H > 10^{24} \rm cm^{-2}$) and high intrinsic luminosity ($\rm
~L_{2-10} > 10^{45} \rm erg ~s^{-1}$), making it one of the most luminous
obscured QSOs at z $>$ 3.5. With the exclusion of W0410-09 we do not detect
X-ray emission from any of the 19 LAEs, except for a 3$\sigma$ signal in the
6-7 keV rest-frame band, interpreted as Fe K$\alpha$ emission, suggesting the
presence of heavily obscured yet undetected AGN emission in several LAEs.
Including W0410-09, the estimated AGN fraction is $f_{\rm AGN}^{\rm LAE} =
5^{+12}_{-4}$%, potentially up to ~35% if unresolved obscured AGN are
considered as suggested by the Fe K$\alpha$ line detection. We conclude that
W0410-09 is in a critical transitional blow-out phase, during which powerful
QSO-driven outflows are clearing the nuclear obscuration, ultimately leading to
an unobscured luminous quasar.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04435v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. X:

exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted
by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of
cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies
with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$
at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo,
Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the
convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of
high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively
low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The
subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to
resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in
the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key
galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences
(e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are
highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive
halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$)
succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV
luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics,
but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that
varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated
galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future
work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the
formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03937v1" target="_blank"><h2>Origin and Evolution of the $Ω$ Structure in the Head-Tail Radio

nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of
head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of
shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and
cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail
galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega"
structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy
using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be
brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be
attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data
suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation
direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic
rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of
the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the
origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the
jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the
early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail
galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin
vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05029v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of an X-ray Luminous Radio-Loud Quasar at $z=3.4$: A Possible

ID830), a quasar at $z=3.4351$, identified as the most X-ray luminous
radio-loud quasar in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field.
ID830 shows a rest-frame 0.5-2 keV luminosity of $\log
(L_\mathrm{0.5-2\,keV}/\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 46.20 \pm 0.12$, with a
steep X-ray photon index ($\Gamma =2.43 \pm 0.21$), and a significant radio
counterpart detected with VLA/FIRST 1.4 GHz and VLASS 3 GHz bands. The
rest-frame UV to optical spectra from SDSS and Subaru/MOIRCS $J$-band show a
dust reddened quasar feature with $A_\mathrm{V} = 0.39 \pm 0.08$ mag and the
expected bolometric AGN luminosity from the dust-extinction-corrected UV
luminosity reaches $L_\mathrm{bol,3000}= (7.62 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{46}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. We estimate the black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH} = (4.40 \pm 0.72)
\times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ based on the MgII$\lambda$2800 emission line width,
and an Eddington ratio from the dust-extinction-corrected UV continuum
luminosity reaches $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd,UV}=1.44 \pm 0.24$ and
$\lambda_{\mathrm{Edd,X}} = 12.8 \pm 3.9$ from the X-ray luminosity, both
indicating the super-Eddington accretion. ID830 shows a high ratio of
UV-to-X-ray luminosities, $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.20 \pm 0.07$ (or
$\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.42 \pm 0.07$ after correcting for jet-linked X-ray
excess), higher than quasars and little red dots in super-Eddington phase with
similar UV luminosities, with $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}<-1.8$. Such a high
$\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ suggests the coexistence of a prominent radio jet and
X-ray corona, in this high Eddington accretion phase. We propose that ID830 may
be in a transitional phase after an accretion burst, evolving from a
super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington state, which could naturally describe the
high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04365v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Apache Point Observatory extra-Galactic Evolution Experiment

the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) project observed seven
dwarf spheroidal satellites (dSphs) of the Milky Way: Carina, Sextans,
Sculptor, Draco, Ursa Minor, Bootes 1, and Fornax. APOGEE radial velocities,
stellar parameters, and Gaia EDR3 proper motions are used to identify member
stars in the vicinity of each dwarf. To properly analyze the abundance patterns
of these galaxies, a novel procedure was developed to determine the measurable
upper limits of the APOGEE chemical abundances as a function of the effective
temperature and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the APOGEE
abundance patterns of these galaxies (limited to [Fe/H] $>$ -2.5) agree with
those found in high-resolution optical studies after abundance offsets are
applied. Most of the galaxies studied have abundance patterns that are
distinctly different from the majority of stars found in the MW halo,
suggesting that these galaxies contributed little to the MW halo above [Fe/H]
$>$ -2.0. From these abundance patterns, we find that these dSphs tend to
follow two types of chemical evolution paths: episodic and continuous star
formation, a result that is consistent with previous photometric studies of
their star formation histories. We explore whether mass and/or environment have
an impact on whether a galaxy has an episodic or continuous star formation
history, finding evidence that, in addition to the galaxy's mass, proximity to
a larger galaxy and the cessation of star formation may drive the overall shape
of the chemical evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04780v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synthetic JWST galaxy images in the TNG50 simulation - I. Model

8.5 $, tailored to match the depth and resolution of current deep JWST surveys
(NGDEEP and JADES). We analyse the performance of spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting on the simulated sample, focusing on the recovery of photometric
redshift and stellar mass. At $ z \leq 5 $, we find that 90 per cent of
redshifts are recovered within $ \pm0.2 $, but performance declines at $ z = 6
$. Stellar masses are generally well-recovered within a factor of 2, but are
systematically underestimated regardless of redshift, a trend that is more
pronounced at the high-mass end $ ( \log_{10}(M_\ast/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \geq 10
) $. In addition, we study the observer-frame colours of galaxies in this
redshift range as well as the SED-inferred $UVJ$ diagram. We find that TNG50
galaxies broadly follow the tendencies marked by observations, but tend to be
slightly redder at lower masses and bluer at higher masses, regardless of
redshift. Finally, using a colour-based definition of quiescence, we determine
the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass at $ 3 \leq z

galaxies and its dependence on morphology in 10 redshift bins at $0.2<z<5.5$
using the COSMOS2025 catalog built from $0.54 \, {\rm deg}^2$ JWST imaging from
COSMOS-Web. Galaxies are selected by type using the $NUVrJ$ rest-frame color
diagram and classified morphologically by bulge-to-total light ratio ($B/T$).
The quiescent SMF shows rapid early build-up, with the most massive systems
(${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})\gtrsim11$) assembled by $z\sim1$ and
evolving little since. The star-forming SMF evolves more slowly, following a
mass-evolution scenario where galaxies grow via star formation and quench at
the characteristic mass $\log(M^{*}/{\rm M}_{\odot})\sim10.6$. Bulge systems
($B/T>0.6$) dominate the quiescent SMF at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm
M_{\odot}})>10$ at all redshifts, while disks ($B/T<0.2$) dominate at ${\rm
log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})<9$. However, most bulge-dominated galaxies are
star-forming, with their fraction increasing with redshift and decreasing mass,
consistent with being progenitors of quiescent bulges. We find evidence for
environmental quenching onset at $z\sim3$ from the upturn in the quiescent SMF
at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})<9.5$, contributed by disk-dominated
galaxies consistent with satellite quenching that retains disk morphologies.
Number densities of ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})>10$ quiescent
galaxies are lower than recent literature by $0.1-0.7$ dex, but agree well with
simulations at $2<z<3$. At $z>3$, simulations increasingly underpredict
observations. Finally, we build an empirical model describing galaxy number
density evolution by parametrizing quenching rates, baryon conversion
efficiency, and bulge formation. Our model supports a scenario where
star-forming galaxies grow central bulges before quenching in massive halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05068v1" target="_blank"><h2>NGC 6860, Mrk 915, and MCG -01-24-012. II. Inflowing and outflowing cold

kpc (projected sizes) of three nearby Seyfert galaxies, with AGN luminosities
of ~ 10$^{44}$ erg/s, using observations of the CO(2-1) emission line, obtained
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at ~
0.5-0.8$^{\prime\prime}$ (~ 150-400 pc) spatial resolutions. After modeling the
CO profiles with multiple Gaussian components, we detected regions with
double-peak profiles that exhibit kinematics distinct from the dominant
rotational motion. In NGC 6860, a molecular outflow surrounding the bipolar
emission of the [O III] ionized gas is observed extending up to $R_{out}$ ~ 560
pc from the nucleus. There is evidence of molecular inflows along the stellar
bar, although an alternative scenario, involving a decoupled rotation in a
circumnuclear disk (CND) can also explain the observed kinematics. Mrk 915
shows double-peak CO profiles along one of its spiral arms. Due to its
ambiguous disk orientation, part of the CO emission can be interpreted as a
molecular gas inflow or an outflow reaching $R_{out}$ ~ 2.8 kpc. MCG -01-24-012
has double-peak profiles associated with a CND, perpendicular to the [O III]
bipolar emission. The CO in the CND is rotating while outflowing within
$R_{out}$ ~ 3 kpc, with the disturbances possibly being caused by the passage
of the ionized gas outflow. Overall, the mass inflow rates are larger than the
accretion rate needed to produce the observed luminosities, suggesting that
only a fraction of the inflowing gas ends up feeding the central black holes.
Although we found signatures of AGN feedback on the cold molecular phase, the
mass outflow rates of ~ 0.09-3 M$_\odot$/yr indicate an overall weak impact at
these AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, we may be witnessing the start of the
depletion and ejection of the molecular gas reservoir that has accumulated over
time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04736v1" target="_blank"><h2>Heavy black hole seed survivors in dwarf galaxies: a case study of Leo I</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Matthew T.

progenitors of these SMBHs having birth masses up to ${\sim} 10^5~{\rm

I, harbors a heavy-seed descendant. Using Monte-Carlo merger trees to generate
the merger histories of 1,000 dark matter halos similar to the Milky Way (MW;
with a mass of ${\sim} 10^{12}~{\rm M_\odot}$ at redshift $z{=}0$). We search
for Leo-like satellite halos among these merger trees, and investigate the
probability that the progenitors of some of these satellites formed a heavy
seed. We derive the likelihood of such "heavy seed survivors" (HSSs) across
various formation and survival criteria as well as Leo-similarity criteria. We
find that the virial temperature for the onset of atomic cooling and rapid gas
infall that yields heavy seeds, $T_{\rm act}$, has the largest impact on the
number of HSSs. We find HSSs in a fraction $0.7\%$, $18.1\%$, and $96.5\%$ of
MW-like halos when $T_{\rm act}$ is set to $9,000$K, $7,000$K, and $5,000$K
respectively. This suggests that Leo I could be hosting a heavy seed and could
provide an opportunity to disentangle heavy seeds from other SMBH formation
mechanisms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04843v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST provides a new view of cosmic dawn: latest developments in studies

recently suggested as promising probes of small-scale ($\lesssim10^9
M_{\odot}$) dark matter substructure. Populations of cold dark matter (CDM)
subhalos, predicted in hierarchical structure formation theory, can break the
symmetry of arcs near the critical curve, leading to positional shifts in the
observed images. We present a novel statistical method to constrain the average
subhalo mass fraction ($f_{\rm sub}$) in clusters that takes advantage of this
induced positional asymmetry. Focusing on CDM, we extend a recent semi-analytic
model of subhalo tidal evolution to accurately simulate realistic subhalos
within a cluster-scale host. We simulate the asymmetry of lensed arcs from
these subhalo populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Using mock
data, we demonstrate that our method can reliably recover the simulated $f_{\rm
sub}$ to within 68\% CI in 73\% of cases, regardless of the lens model,
astrometric precision, and image morphology. We show that the constraining
power of our method is optimized for larger samples of well observed arcs,
ideal for recent JWST observations of cluster lenses. As a preliminary test, we
apply our method to the MACSJ0416 Warhol arc and AS1063 System 1. For Warhol we
constrain the upper limit on $\log f_{\rm sub} < -3.40^{+1.06}_{-0.97}$, while
for AS1063 System 1 we constrain $\log f_{\rm sub} = -2.36^{+0.56}_{-0.89}$
(both at 68\% CI), consistent with CDM predictions. We elaborate on our
method's limitations and its future potential to place stringent constraints on
dark matter properties in cluster environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05056v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quokka-based understanding of outflows (QED) - IV. Limitations of

Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title, abstract), outflow (title, abstract), AGN (title, abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The presence of broad wings in the H$\alpha$} line is commonly used as a
diagnostic of the presence and properties of galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies. However, the accuracy of this approach has not been subjected to
extensive testing. In this paper, we use high-resolution simulations of
galactic wind launching to calibrate the extent to which broad H$\alpha$} wings
can be used to infer the properties of galactic outflows. For this purpose, we
analyse a series of high-resolution wind simulations from the QED suite
spanning two orders of magnitude in star formation surface density
($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$). We show that the broad component of H$\alpha$}
emission correlates well with the wind mass flux at heights $\sim1$ kpc above
the galactic plane, but that the correlation is poor at larger distances from
the plane, and that even at 1 kpc the relationship between mass flux and
surface brightness of broad H$\alpha$} is significantly sub-linear. The
sub-linear scaling suggests that the electron column density in the wind
increases systematically with outflow strength, and that the conventional
assumption of constant electron density in the wind leads to a systematic
overestimate of how steeply mass loading factors depend on
$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$. We provide empirical scaling relations that observers

performs significantly worse than the empirical correlation we provide.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05342v1" target="_blank"><h2>Intensive X-ray/UVOIR continuum reverberation mapping of the Seyfert AGN

optical monitoring of the bright Seyfert active galactic nucleus (AGN)
MCG+08-11-11 with Swift, supported by optical-infrared ground-based monitoring.
The 12 resultant, well-sampled, lightcurves are highly correlated; in
particular, the X-ray to UV correlation r_max = 0.85 is, as far as we know, the
highest yet recorded in a Seyfert galaxy. The lags increase with wavelength, as
expected from reprocessing of central high-energy emission by surrounding
material. Our lag spectrum is much shallower than that obtained from an optical
monitoring campaign conducted a year earlier when MCG+08-11-11 was
approximately 4 times brighter. After filtering out long-term trends in the
earlier optical lightcurves we recover shorter lags consistent with our own -
demonstrating concurrent reverberation signals from different spatial scales
and the luminosity dependence of the measured lags. We use our lag spectrum to
test several physical models, finding that disc reprocessing models cannot
account for the observed 'excess' lags in the u and r-i-bands that are highly
indicative of the Balmer and Paschen continua produced by reprocessing in the
broad line region (BLR) gas. The structure seen in both the variable (rms) and
lag spectra, and the large time delay between X-ray and UV variations
(approximately 2 days) all suggest that the BLR is the dominant reprocessor.
The hard X-ray spectrum (Gamma approximately 1.7) and faint, red, UV-optical
spectrum both indicate that the Eddington accretion ratio is low: approximately
0.03. The bolometric luminosity then requires that the black hole mass is
substantially greater than current reverberation mapping derived estimates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05113v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially-resolved PAH_3.3 emission and stellar ages in ram pressure

in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the
interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3
micrometres PAH emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the
Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl = 0.306, tracing the effects of
environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam
and HST photometry, we perform spatially-resolved UV to mid-infrared spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting, characterising stellar populations in both
galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detect PAH_3.3
mission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5 sigma, with morphologies revealing
disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies,
PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped
tails up to a distance of 40 kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3
emission agree with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100
Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4 dex, but the relation appears to be age
dependent. The spatial correlation between PAH strength, stellar age, and SFR -
consistent across disks and tails - demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules
can survive and be stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by
the SED fitting provide the first observational evidence outside the Local
Universe for the fireball model of star formation in stripped clumps. This work
represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies,
offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme

Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs)
exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that
surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of
this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs
whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and
successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic
model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV
$\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron
and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons
in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission
resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring
within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a
hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff
energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius.
Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are
likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within
ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump
in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although
the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would
necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared
to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the
observed TeV excess.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04750v1" target="_blank"><h2>The essential elements of dust evolution: a-C(:H) nanoparticle

aims to characterise semi-conducting a-C(:H) nanoparticle structures and, in
particular, their property-characterising aromatic domain size distribution and
so predict how they will behave in intense UV radiation fields that can
fragment them through dissociative and charge effects as a result of
carbon-carbon bond-breaking. Using a statistical approach we determine the
typical sizes of the aromatic domains, their size distribution, how they are
network-bonded, and where they are to be found within the structure. We
consider the effects of thermal excitation, photo-dissociation and charging of
a-C(:H) nanoparticles, and the products of their fragmentation. The derived UV
photon-induced fragmentation lifetimes for nanometre-sized a-C(:H)
nanoparticles, with radii ~0.4-0.5nm radius and containing ~40-60 carbon atoms,
are of the order of 10^6-10^7yr in the diffuse interstellar medium and likely
10^2-10^4 times shorter in photodissociation regions, depending on the local
radiation field intensity. Grains larger than this are stable against
photodissociation. In H{\footnotesize II} regions only a-C(:H) nanoparticles
with radii greater than 0.7nm (> 150 carbon atoms) are likely to survive. The
photon-driven fragmentation of sub-nanometre a-C(:H) particles was determined
to be important in the diffuse interstellar medium and also in high excitation

a sample of 8,960 galaxies from the MaNGA survey to track the position of the

the stellar mass of the galaxies and their current position in both the SFMS

strongly affecting variability in SFR. While most of the fluctuations are
compatible with stochasticity, there is a very weak but statistically
significant preference for $\sim135-150$ Myr time-scales. These results support
a strong self-regulation of SFR within galaxies, establishing characteristic
intensities and time-scales for bursts of star formation and quenching
episodes. We also find that short-term variability cannot account for the

into the role of mergers in galaxy evolution. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's
upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will allow for an unprecedented
study of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use mock images of
galaxies at $z\sim0$ ($z\sim0.2$ for \textsc{NewHorizon}) from
\textsc{NewHorizon}, \textsc{eagle}, \textsc{IllustrisTNG}, and
\textsc{Magneticum Pathfinder} simulations to predict the properties of tidal
features in LSST-like images. We find that tidal features are more prevalent
around blue galaxies with intrinsic colours $(g-i)\leq0.5$, compared to redder
ones, at fixed stellar mass. This trend correlates with elevated specific star
formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}>10^{-10}\mathrm{\:yr}^{-1}$), suggesting that
merger-induced star formation contributes to the bluer colours. Tidal feature
hosts in the red sequence appear to exhibit colour profiles offset to bluer
colours for galaxies with stellar masses
$10^{10}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$, similarly
blue cloud tidal feature host galaxies appear to have their colour profiles
offset to bluer colours for
$10^{9.5}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{10.5}$. However,
the differences in colour profiles in either the red sequence or the blue cloud
are not statistically robust and larger samples are needed to test if these
differences are real. The predictions across the simulations are quantitatively
distinct; therefore, LSST observations will allow us to further constrain the

of merger events. Cosmological simulations can represent this series of mergers
as a graph-like ``tree'' structure. Previous work has shown these merger trees
are sensitive to cosmology simulation parameters, but as DM structures, the
outstanding question of their sensitivity to DM models remains unanswered. In
this work, we investigate the feasibility of deep learning methods trained on
merger trees to infer Warm Dark Matter (WDM) particles masses from the DREAMS
simulation suite. We organize the merger trees from 1,024 zoom-in simulations
into graphs with nodes representing the merger history of galaxies and edges
denoting hereditary links. We vary the complexity of the node features included
in the graphs ranging from a single node feature up through an array of several
galactic properties (e.g., halo mass, star formation rate, etc.). We train a
Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the WDM mass using the graph
representation of the merger tree as input. We find that the GNN can predict
the mass of the WDM particle ($R^2$ from 0.07 to 0.95), with success depending
on the graph complexity and node features. We extend the same methods to
supernovae and active galactic nuclei feedback parameters $A_\text{SN1}$,
$A_\text{SN2}$, and $A_\text{AGN}$, successfully inferring the supernovae
parameters. The GNN can even infer the WDM mass from merger tree histories
without any node features, indicating that the structure of merger trees alone

the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated
with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a
GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from
post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial
parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary
merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General
Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of

accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the
leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial
rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values
of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of
large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen
gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle
trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements
in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We
find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with
mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE
mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass
ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning
black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and

radio data at X-band of the radio relic: MACS J0717.5+3745. Radio relics trace
shock waves in the intracluster medium (ICM) produced during mergers.
Understanding the physical characteristics of relics is important for
determining their nature, whether for example they are thermal ICM electrons
that are accelerated, or whether they are fossil electrons re-accelerated by a
merger event. Radio spectropolarimetric analysis, such as the Stokes
QU-fitting, provides a diagnostic of the nature and structure of the magnetized
plasma internal or external to the source, with important implications for
theoretical models. The high-frequency polarisation analysis presented here
shows, for the first time, a change in the magneto-ionic structure compared to
the low-frequency data available in the literature. These high-frequency,
polarised data could be interpreted also with an internal depolarisation
behaviour and this new finding may be used to investigate possible particle
acceleration mechanism. If that is true, the change in the behaviour of the
polarised signal could be tracing physical properties of a population of
non-thermal particles that are undergoing to a re-acceleration of particles in
the relic by large-scale internal shocks of Active Galactic Nuclei jet fossil
particles ejected from the central Narrow Angle Tail radio galaxy. New upcoming
broad-band VLA X- and Ku-bands data will clarify this. Finally, we conclude
that high-frequency, high-sensitive, spectropolarimetric radio data should be
explored further, as they can effectively trace shock fronts and thereby
provide insights into the intrinsic magneto-ionic properties of radio
components.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05268v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Mass-Independent Damping Timescale in Black Hole Accretion Systems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Haoyang Zhang, Shenbang Yang, Li Zhang, Benzhong Dai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by
astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion
systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales
(CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the
underlying physical structure of accretion disks. We investigate, for the first
time, the long-term hard X-ray variability of black hole and neutron star
accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert
Telescope 157-month catalog. Applying a damped random walk model, we measure
CDTs for 39 Seyfert galaxies, 17 blazars, 82 X-ray binaries, and one tidal
disruption event. Unexpectedly, these CDTs span months to years but with a
mass-independent feature, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This
puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from
disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes
characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in
blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving
hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the

to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with spectroscopically measured dynamical
masses. For each observed UDG, we identify the simulated dark matter halo that
best matches its dynamical mass. In general, observed UDGs are matched to
simulated galaxies with lower stellar masses than they are observed to have.
These simulated galaxies also have halo masses much less than would be expected
given the observed UDG's stellar mass and the stellar mass -- halo mass
relationship. We use the recently established relation between globular cluster
(GC) number and halo mass, which has been shown to be applicable to UDGs, to
better constrain their observed halo masses. This method indicates that
observed UDGs reside in relatively massive dark matter halos. This creates a
striking discrepancy: the simulated UDGs are matched to the dynamical masses of
observed ones, but not their total halo masses. In other words, simulations can
produce UDGs in halos with the correct inner dynamics, but not with the massive
halos implied by GC counts. We explore several possible explanations for this
tension, from both the observational and theoretical sides. We propose that the
most likely resolution is that observed UDGs may have fundamentally different
dark matter halo profiles than those produced in NIHAO and HESTIA. This
highlights the need for a simulation that self-consistently produces galaxies
of a stellar mass of $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$ in dark matter halos that exhibit the

10.55 ms pulsar and a companion star with mass $1-1.6\,M_{\sun}$ in a 0.15-day
orbit. Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron
star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common
envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant
envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE
phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for
accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes
involved in CE evolution.In this study, we investigate the influence of Roche
lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the
spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process
affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution
code \texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \texttt{BSE} to
model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the
distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic
field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO
accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods
through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies

simulations, exploring a wide range of $\delta B / B_0$ and scale separations
between the turbulence driving scale, $L$, and kinetic scales, $c/\omega_{\rm
p}$. The steady-state collisionless turbulence in our simulations broadly
resembles that of MHD, but the development of pressure anisotropy steepens the
scaling between magnetic field strength, $B$, and scalar field-line curvature,
$K_\parallel$ -- yielding $B \propto K_\parallel^{-3/4}$ -- and consequently
modifies the power-law slope of the probability density function of
$K_\parallel$; this slope hardens from $K_\parallel^{-2.5}$ to
$K_\parallel^{-2.0}$ as $\delta B / B_0$ increases from 4 to 140. Pressure
anisotropy also triggers mirror and firehose instabilities, with the
volume-filling fractions of these fluctuations increasing with $\delta B /
B_0$; for our largest $\delta B / B_0$, $20\%$ of the volume is mirror-unstable
and $6\%$ is firehose-unstable. Both the curvature and the Larmor-scale
fluctuations in collisionless large-amplitude turbulence are expected to
significantly influence cosmic ray transport and acceleration in the
interstellar medium of our Galaxy and the intracluster medium of galaxy
clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05015v1" target="_blank"><h2>LHAASO Detection of Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission toward the

in the very-high-energy (VHE) domain from the five nearby GMCs with a stacking
analysis based on a 4.5-year $\gamma$-ray observation with the Large High
Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) experiment. The spectral energy
distributions derived from the GMCs are consistent with the expected
$\gamma$-ray flux produced via CR interacting with the ISM in the energy
interval 1 - 100 $~\rm$ TeV. In addition, we investigate the presence of the CR
spectral `knee' by introducing a spectral break in the $\gamma$-ray data. While
no significant evidence for the CR knee is found, the current KM2A measurements
from GMCs strongly favor a proton CR knee located above 0.9$~\rm$ PeV, which is
consistent with the latest measurement of the CR spectrum by ground-based
experiments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04099v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring Cosmological Constraints of the Void-Lensing Cross-Correlation

construct a mock galaxy catalog to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, which
incorporates the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST. We divide
the galaxy sample into seven photometric-redshift (photo-$z$) tomographic bins
and identify 2D voids within each bin using the Voronoi tessellation and
watershed algorithm. We measure the angular cross-power spectrum between the
void distribution and the weak lensing signal, and estimate the covariance
matrix via jackknife resampling combined with pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ approach to
account for the partial sky correction. We employ the Halo Void Dust Model
(HVDM) to model the void-matter cross-power spectrum and adopt the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological
and void parameters. We find that our method can accurately extract the
cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological
parameters from the void-lensing analysis are comparable or even tighter than
the weak lensing only case. This demonstrates that the void-lensing serves as
an effective cosmological probe and a valuable complement to galaxy photometric
surveys, particularly for the Stage-IV surveys targeting the high-redshift

astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star
formation, heat conduction, and cosmic-ray scattering. MHD turbulence can be
decomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfv\'en-each
contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing
and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the
limited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we
use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode
energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find
that the Alfv\'en and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and
together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the
fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions,
multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We
further introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional
Residual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic
data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct
morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing
anisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of
isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We
further demonstrate that our machine learning model can robustly recover the
mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean absolute errors
of approximately 0.05 for seen data and 0.1 for unseen data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05484v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-Gaussian Galaxy Stochasticity and the Noise-Field Formulation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Henrique Rubira, Fabian Schmidt</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 33 pages, 2 figures; comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We revisit the stochastic, or noise, contributions to the galaxy density

In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network
(FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize
dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data
taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to
identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's
NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real
data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates
recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and
reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo
have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The
main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte

\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach
introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster
than the traditional method used in
\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN

relativistic jets arising from explosive events at cosmological distances. The
nature of the jet and the configuration of the local magnetic fields are still
unclear, with the distinction between different models possibly provided by the
detection of early-time polarisation. Past observations do not agree on a
universal scenario describing early-time polarisation in GRB afterglows, and
new studies are necessary to investigate this open question. We present here
the discovery of GRB\,240419A, its redshift determination of $z=5.178$, its
early-time optical polarimetry observations, and the multi-wavelength
monitoring of its afterglow. We analysed three epochs of polarimetric data to
derive the early-time evolution of the polarisation. The multi-wavelength light
curve from the X-rays to the near-infrared band was also investigated to give a
broader perspective on the whole event. We find a high level of polarisation,
$P=6.97^{+1.84}_{-1.52}$\,\%, at 1740~s after the GRB trigger, followed by a
slight decrease up to $P=4.81^{+1.87}_{-1.53}$\,\% at 3059~s. On the same
timescale, the polarisation position angle is nearly constant. The multi-band
afterglow at the time of the polarisation measurements is consistent with a
forward shock (FS), while the earlier evolution at $t-t_0\lesssim700$ s can be
associated with the interplay between the forward and the reverse shocks or
with energy injection. The detected polarised radiation when the afterglow is
FS-dominated and the stable position angle are consistent with an ordered
magnetic field plus a turbulent component driven by large-scale
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. The lack of a jet break in the light curve
prevents a comparison of the polarisation temporal evolution with theoretical
expectations from magnetic fields amplified by microscopic-scale turbulence,

(VHE) gamma-ray emission from the prototypical radio quasar 3C273. The temporal
and the spectral properties of this component do not appear compatible with the
extrapolation of the beamed blazar-like emission of the inner, pc-scale jet. We
explore the possibility that the VHE component is produced in the jet at kpc
scale through the inverse Compton emission of a population of ultra-high energy
electrons (with Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 10^8$). In the model these electrons
are accelerated through the shear acceleration mechanism, and they also account
for the still puzzling X-ray emission of knots detected by {\it Chandra} in the
large-scale jets of several powerful quasars (including 3C273). In our scenario
the VHE component can be interpreted as the integrated emission from the two
brightest knots of the 3C273 jet. We speculate that the decay of the emission
on the timescale of $\sim 3$ years could be accounted for by the scenario if
the VHE radiation is produced in some compact regions in the downstream flow of
a recollimation shock.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04282v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of a 9.67-s pulsar in an ultraluminous X-ray source in NGC

pulsations at P= 9.6652 +/- 0.0002 s in a new ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX)
in the galaxy NGC 4631. This source, dubbed as X-8, shows one of the largest
spin-up rates ever observed, dP/dt = (-9.6 +/- 0.5)*1E-8 s/s. These findings
indicate that the compact object is a neutron star, and X-8 is a new member of
the pulsating ULX class. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity of X-8 is ~3.4E39 erg/s, and
its X-ray spectrum can be described by an absorbed disk blackbody or a cut-off
power law, similar to what is observed in other pulsating ULXs. We discuss two
possible causes for the large spin-up rate: Doppler shift from orbital motion
of the neutron star and intrinsic spin-up due to accretion torque. This new ULX
pulsar adds a key source to the small known population, and will enable future
studies to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for their
super-Eddington luminosities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04121v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. I.

impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation

Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive ($M\sim 10^6
\Msun$) and shine as bright as a galaxy ($L\sim 10^8 \Msun)$. Using a simple
$\chi^2$ minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e.
\JADESeleven, \JADEStwelve, and \JADESzthirteen) were identified by
\cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the
identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available
high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving
this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network
(FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep
Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms
JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared
goodness of fit test, yet they are $\sim10^4$ times faster than the
Neadler-Mead $\chi^2$ minimization method used in \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. We
further identify six {\it new photometric} Dark Star candidates across
redshifts $z \sim 9$ to $z \sim 14$. These findings underscore the power of
neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing

modified gravity (MG) as the driver of the late-time cosmic acceleration. The
decay rate ($DR$) of cosmological gravitational potential, being sensitive to
gravity and being immune to various astrophysical uncertainties, enables GR
tests independent to other structure growth probes. Recently we have measured
$DR$ at $0.2\leq z\leq 1.4$, combining the DR9 galaxy catalog from the DESI
imaging surveys and Planck cosmic microwave background maps
\citep{arXiv:2411.12594}. Here we use this measurement to test gravity, and
restrict the analysis to one-parameter extensions to the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. We consider four one-parameter MG parameterizations. One is
$f(a)=\Omega_m^\gamma(a)$. The other three adopt the gravitational slip
parameter $\eta=1$ and consider variations in the effective gravitational
constant $G_{\rm eff}/G$ with the parameterization $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_\Lambda
\Omega_\Lambda(a)/\Omega_\Lambda$, $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_1 a$ or
$\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_2 a^2$. We find $\gamma=0.47^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, consistent
with the GR prediction $\gamma\simeq 0.55$. We also find
$\Sigma_\Lambda=0.018^{+0.052}_{-0.053}$, $\Sigma_1=0.020^{+0.065}_{-0.062}$,

signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental
effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to
$\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where
$\ell_{\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the
frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We
investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity
distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\#
sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope
(ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \gtrsim
0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 -
n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be
detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect
amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET,
our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail
of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation
channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and
phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries
merge in AGN migration traps.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05409v1" target="_blank"><h2>Charge-dependent spectral softenings of primary cosmic-rays from proton

rays can achieve is charge dependent. However, the observational verification
of such a fundamental relation is still lack due to the difficulty of measuring
the spectra of individual particles from one (kind of) source(s) up to very
high energies. This work reports direct measurements of the carbon, oxygen, and
iron spectra from ~ 20 gigavolts to ~ 100 teravolts (~ 60 teravolts for iron)
with 9 years of on-orbit data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer
(DAMPE). Distinct spectral softenings have been directly detected in these
spectra for the first time. Combined with the updated proton and helium
spectra, the spectral softening appears universally at a rigidity of ~ 15
teravolts. A nuclei mass dependent softening is rejected at a confidence level
of > 99.999%. Taking into account the correlated structures at similar energies
in the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays, one of the most natural
interpretations of the spectral structures is the presence of a nearby cosmic
ray source. In this case, the softening energies correspond to the acceleration
upper limits of such a source, forming the so-called Peters cycle of the
spectra. The results thus offer observational verification of the long-standing
prediction of the charge-dependent energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05279v1" target="_blank"><h2>Focus Point on Tensions in Cosmology from Early to Late Universe: Part

the high precision testing of the frame-dragging effect predicted by General
Relativity are presented. The data on the S-stars monitoring in the Galactic
center obtained by GRAVITY collaboration were analysed within the
Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach. The results enabled to probe
the role of the cosmological constant, of the dark matter, the star cluster in
the core of the Galaxy obtaining an upper limit for the star density. The
topics include the conversion of high-frequency relic gravitational waves into
photons in cosmological magnetic field, cosmological gravitational waves
stochastic background generation through the spontaneous breaking of a global
baryon number symmetry, observational predictions of the Starobinsky inflation
model and other studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04459v1" target="_blank"><h2>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB
  polarization rotation angle</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hua Zhai, Si-Yu Li, Yang Liu, Yiwei Zhong, Hong Li, Yaqiong Li, Congzhan Liu, Mingzhe Li, Xinmin Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages,10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support
the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the
dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom
scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical
nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters,
specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this
interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We
forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT)
experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from
Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of
observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance
$\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the
polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a
scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With
$50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to
reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement
over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial
fluctuations in the dark energy field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04163v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observational Constrains on the Sgr A$^*$ Black Hole Immersed in a Dark
  Matter Halo: Shadow and S2 Star Orbit</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhen Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It is widely believed that Sgr A$^*$, located at the center of our Galaxy, is
a supermassive black hole. Recent observations of its shadow and long-term
monitoring of the S2 star have provided compelling evidence supporting this
hypothesis. These observational advancements also offer valuable opportunities
to explore the physical properties of the black hole and its surrounding
environment. Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and
around Sgr A$^*$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole
embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both
black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black
hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo,
and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how
the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star.
Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data
of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters.
The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological
insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in
our Galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04546v1" target="_blank"><h2>Parameterizing Noise Covariance in Maximum-Likelihood Component
  Separation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Goureesankar Sathyanathan, Josquin Errard, Soumen Basak</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce a noise-aware extension to the parametric maximum-likelihood
framework for component separation by modeling correlated $1/f^\alpha$ noise as
a harmonic-space power law. This approach addresses a key limitation of
existing implementations, for which a mismodelling of the statistical
properties of the noise can lead to biases in the characterization of the
spectral laws, and consequently biases in the recovered CMB maps. We propose a
novel framework based on a modified ridge likelihood embedded in an
ensemble-average pipeline and derive an analytic bias correction to control
noise-induced foreground residuals. We discuss the practical applications of
this approach in the absence of true noise information, leading to the choice
of white noise as a realistic assumption. As a proof of concept, we apply this
methodology to a set of simplified, idealized simulations inspired by the
specifications of the proposed ECHO (CMB-Bh$\overline{a}$rat) mission, which
features multi-frequency, large-format focal planes. We forecast the $95 \%$
upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{95}$, under a suite of realistic
noise scenarios. Our results show that for an optimistic full sky observation,
ECHO can achieve $r_{95}\leq 10^{-4}$ even in the presence of significant
correlated noise, demonstrating the mission's capability to probe primordial
gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity. Without degrading the
statistical performance of the traditional component separation, this
methodology offers a robust path toward next-generation B-mode searches and
informs instrument design by quantifying the impact of noise correlations on
cosmological parameter recovery.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04033v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low redshift observational constraints on dark energy models using ANN -

techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale
structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)
pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic
Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for
a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model
based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one
million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.
Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural
networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn
low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with
target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation
of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter
space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias
parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear
bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference
pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic
contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.
Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter
constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m -
S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and
effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These
results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for
upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</p></br></body>
