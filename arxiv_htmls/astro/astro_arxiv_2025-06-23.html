processes intersect, remains poorly characterized despite its critical role in
regulating galaxy evolution. We present results from Project AMIGA Insider,
mapping Andromeda's (M31) inner CGM within 0.25 R_vir (~75 kpc) using 11 QSO
sightlines, bringing our total sample to 54 sightlines from the disk to 2
R_vir. We detect a clear transition between M31's thick disk and CGM at R < 30
kpc, where low/intermediate ions show thick-disk corotating components with
higher column densities than the CGM ones, while high ions exhibit similar
column densities in both the CGM and thick disk. Beyond this region, all ion
column densities decrease with impact parameter, with steeper gradients for low
ions than high ions. The inner CGM (R < 100 kpc) shows more complex gas phases
and multi-component absorption compared to the predominantly single-component
outer CGM. We find no significant azimuthal dependence for any observed ions,
suggesting M31's CGM is shaped by radial processes (e.g., cooling flows,
precipitation) rather than disk-aligned outflows. We estimate the total metal
mass in M31's cool (SiII, SiIII, SiIV) CGM within R_vir to be
(1.9+/-0.3_stat+/-0.7_sys)x10^7 M_sun, leading to a cool gas mass of
approximately 6x10^9 (Z/0.3 Z_sun)^-1 M_sun. The warmer OVI gas may contain at
least 10 times more metal and gas mass. Compared to the COS-Halos L* galaxies,
M31's cool CGM shows lower Si column densities at R < 0.4 R_200 and lower cool
CGM masses, possibly resulting from M31's higher halo mass or different
environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17222v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of the large-scale cosmic web on the X-ray emitting

central role in understanding gas flows that drive a galaxy's evolution. While
CGM properties have been widely studied, the influence of a galaxy's
large-scale cosmic environment on the hot gas content remains less explored. We
investigate how the large-scale cosmic web affects the X-ray surface brightness
(XSB) profiles of galaxies in the context of cosmological simulations. We use
our novel IllustrisTNG-based lightcone, spanning $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.3$, first
developed in our previous work, and generate self-consistent mock X-ray
observations, using intrinsic gas cell information. We apply the filament
finder DisPerSE on the galaxy distributions to identify the cosmic filaments
within the lightcone. We classify central galaxies into five distinct
large-scale environment (LSE) categories: clusters and massive groups, cluster
outskirts, filaments, filament-void transition regions, and voids/walls. We
find that the X-ray surface brightness profiles (XSB) of central galaxies of
dark matter halos in filaments with $M_{\rm 200m} >10^{12}\ M_\odot$ are X-ray
brighter than those in voids and walls, with $20-45%$ deviations in the radial
range of $\sim (0.3-0.5) R_{\rm 200m}$. We investigate the source of this
enhancement and find that the filament galaxies show higher average gas
densities, temperatures, and metallicities compared to voids/walls galaxies.
Our results demonstrate that the impact of the large-scale cosmic environment
is imprinted on the hot CGM's X-ray emission. Future theoretical work on
studying the effect of assembly history, connectivity, and gas accretion on
galaxies in filaments and voids would help to further our understanding of the
impact of the environment on X-ray observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16544v1" target="_blank"><h2>Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through
  quasi-periodic lensed starlight</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hanxi Wang, Miguel Zumalacárregui, Bence Kocsis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), time-domain (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of
galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and
growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of
galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc
have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed.
Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final
parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show
that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and
characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located
behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where
sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral --
leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing
magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in
the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH
binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by
pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance
warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections.
SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm
pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with
comparable masses and $z<0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density.
Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of
single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature
can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain
photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic
lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate
outstanding questions around them.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15999v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detailed analysis of multi-line molecular distributions in the Seyfert

of 13 molecular lines of the nearby type-2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 obtained by
Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to objectively visualize
the features of its center, (1) within a radius of about 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5;
hereafter the "overall region") and (2) the ring shaped starburst region
between 750 pc ($\sim$ 10") and 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5) of the galaxy (hereafter
the "SB ring region"). PCA is a powerful unsupervised machine learning
technique that extracts key information through dimensionality reduction. The
PCA results for the overall region have a possibility to reconstruct a map
representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and difference of volume
density and/or chemical composition between the circumnuclear disk (CND) and
the starburst ring (SB ring). Additionally, the PCA results for the SB ring
region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate
H$_2$ column density and distinction between starburst dominated region and
shock dominated region. Furthermore, the PCA results for the SB ring region
indicate a possible interaction between the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)
outflow and gas in the SB ring. Although further investigation is required, we
suggest that the AGN outflow interacts with gas in the SB ring, as this feature
is consistent with the direction of the AGN outflow and is contributed by CN,
C$_2$H and HCN, which are known to be enhanced by the AGN outflow. These
results demonstrate that PCA can effectively extract features even for galaxies
with complex structures, such as AGN + SB ring. This study also implies that
PCA has the potential to uncover previously unrecognized phenomena by
visualizing latent structures in multi-line data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16843v1" target="_blank"><h2>CosmoGLINT: Cosmological Generative Model for Line Intensity Mapping

large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and
line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative
model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based
generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark
matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences
of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the
halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo --
conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation,
the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including
the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and
redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations
of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock
LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast
DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can
be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy
lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population.
The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to
develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16034v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing Light Unaffiliated Mass Clumps in MACS 0416 on galaxy and galaxy
  cluster scales using JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Marceau Limousin, Derek Perera, Liliya L. R. Williams, Jori Liesenborgs, Gregor Rihtarsic</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to A&A, abstract abridged</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Light unaffiliated mass clumps (LUMCs), i.e. dark matter (DM) components
without any stellar counterparts, have been reported in strong lensing mass
reconstructions of MACS 0416, both on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales. On
galaxy cluster scale, the most recent parametric study based on 303 multiple
images features a LUMC, in the south of the cluster. On galaxy scale, the most
recent GRALE non-parametric study based on 237 multiple images features two
LUMCs, M1 and M2. Given the implications of these findings in the context of
structure formation and evolution, we test these features parametrically, using
LENSTOOL. First, we show that a mass model where each large scale DM component
introduced in the modelling is associated with a stellar counterpart can
reproduce the 303 multiple images, removing the need for any cluster scale LUMC
in \lens. We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding
that one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2
remains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We
find that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but
mildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2.
Besides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by
the adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric
approach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and
non-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface
mass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps.
The difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL
favors a more diffuse mass distribution. We have been able to propose a
parametric mass model without including any LUMCs, providing further evidences
for DM being associated with light in clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16624v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shockingly Effective: Cluster Winds as Engines of Feedback in Starburst

spectroscopy of VV 114, a local infrared-luminous merger undergoing a vigorous
starburst and showing evidence of galactic-scale feedback. The high-resolution
data allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a
broad emission line component ($\sigma_{\rm{broad}} \sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$)
with line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by
stars and radiative shocks. The shock fraction (percent ionization due to
shocks) in the high velocity gas is anticorrelated with projected surface
number density of resolved star clusters, and we find radial density profiles
around clusters are well fit by models of adiabatically expanding cluster winds
driven by massive stellar winds and supernovae (SNe). The total kinetic power
estimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy
deposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that
at least 70\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star
clusters. \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging
reveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of
the shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there
is a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \emph{Chandra}
soft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind. The
energy budget of the superwind is in close agreement with the total kinetic
power of the cluster winds, confirming the superwind is driven by the
starburst.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16280v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing Dark Matter in the Central Regions of Galaxy Clusters Using

a dark matter tracer. Moreover, the ICL co-evolves with the brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG) and the host cluster, making it a valuable tool for understanding
cluster dynamics. In this study, we utilize 426 galaxy clusters (with total
mass $M_{\rm tot}>10^{14} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$) simulated in the cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation Illustris TNG300 to compare the spatial distributions
of dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and ICL and assess their effectiveness as
dark matter tracers in the central regions of clusters at $R_{\rm vir}<0.3$. We
apply the Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC), a methodology for quantifying the
similarity of two-dimensional spatial distributions, to various components of
the galaxy clusters at different dynamical stages. Our findings reveal that the
spatial distributions of both ICL combined with the BCG and gas closely
resemble the dark matter distribution, with higher fidelity observed in more
relaxed galaxy clusters with earlier half-mass epochs. These results
demonstrate that the BCG+ICL component serves as an effective tracer of dark
matter, consistent with previous observational studies linking cluster light to
mass. Moreover, the degree of spatial similarity between the BCG+ICL and dark
matter distributions appears to reflect the dynamical state of the cluster.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16915v1" target="_blank"><h2>Infalling Ultra Faint Dwarfs as Emissaries of the Axiverse?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

Milky Way, namely Leo K \& M at $r \simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the
case that UFG's constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller,
fainter and metal poor compared to the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This
distinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses
formed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark matter model. Here we
show that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of
multiple light bosons representing the 'Axiverse' proposal of String Theory,
where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many
decades in mass. In this context, the
  observed UFG class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of
$3\times 10^{-21}$eV, including Leo K \& M, whereas a lighter axion of
$10^{-22}$eV comprises the bulk of dark matter in all larger galaxies including
the dSph's. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its
velocity dispersion to be smaller $\simeq 1.7$km/s, compared to $\simeq
4.5$km/s for Leo K, since soliton cores are required by the Uncertainty
Principle to be wider at lower momentum. This scenario can be definitively
tested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the
Compton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing
residuals that may be detected by SKA on timescales of approximately 1 week and
4 months, respectively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16028v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Modeling Landscape of Extragalactic CO in CMB Surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yogesh Mehta, Anirban Roy, Simon Foreman, Alexander van Engelen, Nick Battaglia</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) line emission will likely be an important
signal in current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys on small
scales. However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO
emission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB
surveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we
generate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the
broadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power
spectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150,
and 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to
two orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be
detectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will
be a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on
CMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum
analysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on
CMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal
and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times
greater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we
assess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\times$CIB spectra we obtain is
captured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component
analysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like
survey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to
account for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB
experiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16510v1" target="_blank"><h2>Taking a Break at Cosmic Noon: Continuum-selected Low-mass Galaxies

Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in local
populations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant phase of the burst cycle
has not been well studied beyond the local Universe due to observational
limitations. We present a unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass
galaxies ($M_\star < 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$) at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$), uniformly
selected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric redshifts enabled by
20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. The spectra
reveal numerous strong Balmer breaks, which are negatively correlated with the
galaxies' H$\alpha$ equivalent width. By comparing these observations to
synthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple parametrization of bursty
star formation histories, we show that star formation in low-mass galaxies at
cosmic noon is likely dominated by burst cycles with long timescales ($\gtrsim
100$ Myr) and large deviations below the star-forming main sequence ($\gtrsim
0.8$ dex). Our results suggest that galaxies in this population--at least those
within our detection limits--should not be classified solely by their current
star formation rates, but instead viewed as a unified population undergoing
dynamic movement above and below the star-forming main sequence. The derived
constraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations are important for this
class of galaxies, indicating that galaxy-scale gas cycles--rather than
molecular-cloud-scale stochasticity--are the primary regulators of star
formation variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16583v1" target="_blank"><h2>Analysis of shape and angular orientation parameters of

characterize the shape of the J-factor emission signal on the sky. We find
that, at a fixed dJ/d{\Omega} contour,the shape is well-fit by an ellipse, with
semi-major axis Rmajor and semi-minor axis Rminor measured in degrees on the
sky. We use least squares fitting to fit ellipses to the J-factor emission,
viewed from the solar location. The ratio of minor to major axes
(Rminor/Rmajor) allows us to characterize the shape of each contour, with ratio
1.0 corresponding to circular/spherical emission. These results provide new
expectations for the shape of dark matter annihilation emission signals we
might expect to see if dark matter is annihilating with its own anti-particle.
We find that both the shape and angular orientation of the emission signal is
different than results predict from dark matter only simulations. In terms of
shape, we find that the ratios of semi-minor to semi-major axis is always
consistently at 0.8, revealing a consistent circular emission shape, whereas
with dark matter only emission signals the range of ratios from halo to halo is
broader, and often closer to 0.5, showing a much more elliptical shape in
general. In terms of angular orientation, we find that the major axis of the
J-factor emission signal maps for FIRE halos are consistently aligned with the
galactic plane within a few degrees, meaning that excess emission out of the
plane would be hard to explain with a dark matter annihilation signal. However,
we also find that the expected emission signal would be consistent with
Fermi-LAT measurements showing a galactic center excess in full hydrodynamical
simulations with stars and gas included, while dark-matter-only simulations do
not produce the expected signal.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16927v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shadow in the Galactic Center: Theoretical Concept -- Prediction --

To be published in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use global MHD galaxy simulations to investigate the effects of spiral
arms on the evolution of magnetic fields and star formation within a
self-regulated interstellar medium (ISM). The same galaxy is simulated twice:
once with self-consistent stellar spiral arms and once more with the stellar
spirals suppressed via a novel numerical approach, using the Ramses AMR code.
Spiral arms continually promote star formation, with 2.6 times higher rates in
the spiral galaxy. The higher rate is due to high gas columns gathered along
the spiral arms, rather than increasing the star formation efficiency at a
given gas column. In both cases, the magnetic field is initially amplified via
a small-scale dynamo driven by turbulence due to supernova feedback. Only the
spiral galaxy exhibits late-time, consistent field growth due to a large-scale
dynamo (e-folding time $\sim600$ Myr). This results in volume-averaged field
strengths of $\sim 1$ $\mu$G after 1 Gyr of evolution. The mean-fields tend to
align themselves with the spiral arms and are coherent up to 10 kpc scales. We
demonstrate a novel large-scale dynamo mechanism, whereby spiral-driven radial
flows enable the mean-field amplification.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16090v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identifying Ring Galaxies in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Using Machine

understanding the nature and distribution of dark matter, galactic
interactions, and the internal secular evolution of galaxies. However, the
limited number of existing ring galaxy catalogs has constrained deeper
exploration in this field. To address this gap, we introduce a two-stage binary
classification model based on the Swin Transformer architecture to identify
ring galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This model first selects
potential candidates and then refines them in a second stage to improve
classification accuracy. During model training, we investigated the impact of
imbalanced datasets on the performance of the two-stage model. We experimented
with various model combinations applied to the datasets of the DESI Legacy
Imaging Surveys DR9, processing a total of 573,668 images with redshifts
ranging from z_spec = 0.01-0.20 and magr <17.5. After applying the two-stage
filtering and conducting visual inspections, the overall Precision of the
models exceeded 64.87%, successfully identifying a total of 8052 newly
discovered ring galaxies. With our catalog, the forthcoming spectroscopic data
from DESI will facilitate a more comprehensive investigation into the formation
and evolution of ring galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16197v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray and Radio Analysis of Abell 1644: Constraints on Cluster Dynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Humaira Bashir, R.

Radio Telescope) observations of the bimodal galaxy cluster Abell 1644 (z =
0.0471), complemented by Chandra X-ray data. While weak lensing measurements
reveal a third substructure in Abell 1644, our radio analysis reveals only two
compact sources coinciding with the respective brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) of the northern (A1644N) and southern (A1644S) substructures, seen in
the X-ray observations. Radio analysis yields compact active galactic nuclei
(AGN) powered sources with radio power $P_{A1644S} = 1.1\times 10^{23} W/Hz$
and $P_{A1644N} = 7.3\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ at 200MHz. We find no evidence of
non-thermal diffuse radio emission, such as halos or relics, within the
sensitivity of our band-2 image. We measured the flux density of each radio
source and performed spectral analysis. A1644N exhibits a synchrotron power law
spectrum while A1644S shows spectral turnover suggestive of synchrotron
self-absorption. X-ray analysis reveals two shock fronts at the southern
substructure with a Mach number $M= 3.21 \pm 0.51$ and $M= 2.22 \pm 0.07$,
indicating an ongoing merger. Our findings reinforce the complex dynamical
nature of Abell 1644 and contribute to a deeper understanding of the cluster's

Accepted in AJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> None found</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore how the correlation between host star metallicity and giant
planets shapes hot Jupiter occurrence as a function of Galactic birth radius
(\rbirth) and phase-space density in the Milky Way disk. Using the GALAH and
APOGEE surveys and a galaxy from the NIHAO simulation suite, we inject hot
Jupiters around stars based on metallicity power laws, reflecting the trend
that giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. For \rbirth\
$\geq 5$ kpc, hot Jupiter occurrence decreases with \rbirth\ by $\sim -0.1%$
per kpc; this is driven by the Galaxy's chemical evolution, where the inner
regions of the disk are more metal-rich. Differences in GALAH occurrence rates
versus APOGEE's and the simulation's at \rbirth\ $< 5$ kpc arise from survey
selection effects. APOGEE and the NIHAO simulation have more high-$\alpha$
sequence stars than GALAH, resulting in average differences in metallicity
(0.2--0.4 dex), $\alpha$-process element enrichment (0.2 dex), and vertical
velocities (7--14 km/s) at each \rbirth\ bin. Additionally, we replicate the
result of \cite{Winter20}, which showed that over 92% of hot Jupiters are
associated with stars in phase-space overdensities, or "clustered
environments." However, our findings suggest that this clustering effect is
primarily driven by chemical and kinematic differences between low and
high-$\alpha$ sequence star properties. Our results support stellar
characteristics, particularly metallicity, being the primary drivers of hot
Jupiter formation, which serves as the "null hypothesis" for interpreting
planet demographics. This underscores the need to disentangle planetary and
stellar properties from Galactic-scale effects in future planet demographics
studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16275v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Radio Spectral Energy Distribution and Star Formation Calibration in

essential for understanding their assembly and evolution over cosmic time. We
present rest-frame radio SEDs of a sample of 160 starburst galaxies at
redshifts 1.5 to 3.5 in the COSMOS field, as part of the MeerKAT International
GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) project. MeerKAT observations,
combined with archival VLA and GMRT data, allow us to determine the integrated
mid-radio (1-10 GHz) continuum (MRC) luminosity and magnetic field strength. A
Bayesian method is used to model the SEDs and separate free-free and
synchrotron emission. We calibrate the star formation rate (SFR) in radio both
directly through SED analysis and indirectly via the infrared-radio correlation
(IRRC). With a mean synchrotron spectral index of approximately 0.7, we find
that the index flattens with redshift and specific SFR, suggesting that cosmic
rays are more energetic in the early universe due to higher star formation
activity. The magnetic field strength increases with redshift (B is
proportional to (1 + z)^0.7) and with star formation rate (B is proportional to
SFR^0.3), indicating a small-scale dynamo as the dominant amplification
mechanism. Accounting for SED evolution, the IRRC remains redshift-invariant
and does not vary with stellar mass at 1.5 < z < 3.5, though the correlation
deviates from linearity. Similarly, we show that SFR estimates based on
integrated MRC luminosity are also redshift-invariant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16645v1" target="_blank"><h2>Coevolution of Intracluster Light and Brightest Cluster Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rebecca J.

groups and clusters bound to the cluster potential, and making up a significant
fraction of the cluster mass. ICL formation and evolution is strongly linked to
the Brightest Cluster Galaxies of clusters. Aims. To compare the properties and
progenitor galaxies of the Intracluster Light (ICL) and Brightest Cluster
Galaxies (BCGs) of clusters and groups at redshift z = 0, and determine how
they coevolve. Methods. We select 127 clusters and groups in the hydrodynamic
Illustris-TNG100 simulation above a mass of $10^{13} M_\odot$. We divide the
ICL from the BCG by applying a surface brightness cut at the Holmberg radius of
26.5 mag/arcsec$^{-2}$, where star particles within this radius are defined as
being attached to the BCG, and outside, the ICL. We then study the properties
and formation history of the ICL and BCG. Results. We find the ICL is generally
composed of material from stripped or merged intermediate mass galaxies, with a
smaller in-situ component, while the BCG is composed of more massive merged
galaxies and has a larger in-situ fraction. The ICL mass fraction increases
weakly with cluster mass, declines with concentration and increases with time
since the BCGs most recent major merger. The ICL is bluer and more metal-poor
than the BCG, but there is no significant difference in the age of the
material. Universally, BCG+ICL systems have negative colour and metallicity
gradients. The ICL and BCG share a high fraction of progenitor galaxies, but
the most significant progenitor is frequently not shared. Conclusions. ICL
properties and formation are tied to the formation histories of the host
cluster and BCG, and thus their properties are individual to each system.
Although the ICL and BCG coevolve, they have distinct formation histories and
properties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16539v1" target="_blank"><h2>Realistic consecutive galaxy mergers form eccentric PTA sources</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Federica Fastidio, Elisa Bortolas, Alessia Gualandris, Alberto Sesana, Justin Read, Walter Dehnen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> None found</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence of a gravitational
wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive
black hole binaries (BHBs). The observed spectrum shows a flattening at lower
frequencies that can be explained by a population of eccentric BHBs. This study
aims to determine the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of the most
massive BHBs, which are potential sources of the GWB. We select successive
galactic major mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation and
re-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin, down to
binary separations of the order of a parsec. Coalescence timescales are
estimated using a semi-analytical model that incorporates gravitational wave
emission and stellar hardening. Throughout our investigation, we consider the
impact of prior mergers on the remnant galaxy in the form of core scouring and
anisotropy, which can influence the subsequent formation and evolution of BHBs.
We find that all the binaries in our sample enter the PTA band with an
eccentricity e>0.85: such a large eccentricity can impact the shape of the PTA
observed GWB spectrum, and it highlights the importance of including the
eccentricity of binaries when interpreting the PTA signal. Furthermore, we find
that: (i) starting from initial separations of a few tens of kpcs, the
dynamical friction phase lasts for a few hundred Myrs; (ii) the binary
formation time is not resolution dependent; (iii) the scatter on the
eccentricity at binary formation decreases with increasing resolution; (iv)
triple systems form whenever a third galaxy interacts with a binary which
hasn't yet reached coalescence.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16512v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic echoes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rimpei Chiba, Jupiter Ding, Chris Hamilton, Matthew W.

the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such
substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of
the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a
satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such
structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in
plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is
perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small
scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third
macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We
derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action
variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the
Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle
simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital
scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself
is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently
generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16135v1" target="_blank"><h2>CNN-Derived Elemental Abundances of LAMOST DR10 Giants: Implications for

($T_{\text{eff}}$), surface gravity (log $g$) and metallicity (both [Fe/H] and
[M/H]) as well as six $\alpha$-elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca) and [$\alpha$/M].
We selected giant stars with \( 3500 \, \text{K} < T_{\text{eff}} < 5500 \,
\text{K} \) and \( 0 \, \text{dex} < \log g < 3.6 \, \text{dex} \) from the

low-resolution spectra $>$ 10, which leaves 1,100,858 giant stars. The spectral
from LAMOST and the labels from APOGEE for 62,511 common stars were used as our
training set. The corresponding test set yields scatters 50 K, 0.06 dex and
0.13 dex for $T_{\text{eff}}$, [Fe/H] and log $g$, respectively. For $\alpha$
elements O, Mg, Si and Ca, the scatters are 0.05 dex, 0.04 dex, 0.03 and 0.04
dex, respectively. For C and N elements, the scatters are 0.07 dex and 0.05
dex. For [$\alpha$/M] and [M/H], the scatters are 0.03 dex and 0.06 dex. The
mean absolute error (MAE) of most elements are between 0.02 $-$ 0.04 dex. The

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), high redshift (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> SMBHs are theorised to undergo significant growth in the early Universe,
however, the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), used as a principal tracer of the
SMBH accretion density, lacks observational constraints at z>6, until now. We
present new measurements of the z=4-10 XLF at intermediate luminosities, taking
advantage of recent deep near-IR imaging from UltraVISTA that enables us to
identify galaxies and AGN at high redshifts within which we identify X-ray
sources using Chandra COSMOS data. We first performed a cross-match to a deep
Chandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately
quantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct
extraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies. With the
resulting z=4-10 X-ray AGN sample, comprised of 21 blind detections and 11
directly extracted detections, we have measured the early space density of AGN,
at moderate-luminosities where the majority of early SMBH growth occurred.
These measurements reveal higher space-densities than expected, based on the
extrapolation of XLF models from lower redshifts. Whilst our measured space
densities at z=4-5 are consistent with model predictions, at z=5-7 we find
space densities of the order of 10$\times$ the extrapolated model predictions
and could be as high as 220$\times$ the model extrapolations at z=7-10. In
addition, we find evidence that a large fraction of the early AGN population
are heavily obscured, with an obscured fraction of 0.982$^{+0.007}_{-0.008}$;
correcting for this obscuration further increases the measured space densities.
Comparing to recent JWST results, these measurements begin to bridge the gap
between the bright-end of the quasar luminosity function and the latest JWST
observations of very early, low-luminosity AGN, indicating a larger fraction of
the first galaxies play host to rapidly growing SMBH than previously thought.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16902v1" target="_blank"><h2>Navigating AGN variability with self-organizing maps</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ylenia Maruccia, Demetra De Cicco, Stefano Cavuoti, Giuseppe Riccio, Paula Sánchez-Sáez, Maurizio Paolillo, Noemi Lery Borrelli, Riccardo Crupi, Massimo Brescia</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), AGN variability (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context. The classification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a challenge
in astrophysics. Variability features extracted from light curves offer a
promising avenue for distinguishing AGNs and their subclasses. This approach
would be very valuable in sight of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST).
  Aims. Our goal is to utilize self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify AGNs
based on variability features and investigate how the use of different subsets
of features impacts the purity and completeness of the resulting
classifications.
  Methods. We derived a set of variability features from light curves, similar
to those employed in previous studies, and applied SOMs to explore the
distribution of AGNs subclasses. We conducted a comparative analysis of the
classifications obtained with different subsets of features, focusing on the
ability to identify different AGNs types.
  Results. Our analysis demonstrates that using SOMs with variability features
yields a relatively pure AGNs sample, though completeness remains a challenge.
In particular, Type 2 AGNs are the hardest to identify, as can be expected.
These results represent a promising step toward the development of tools that
may support AGNs selection in future large-scale surveys such as LSST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15952v1" target="_blank"><h2>Estimating Fe and Mg Abundances in the Milky Way Dwarf Galaxies Using

dataset, which includes broadband g and i filters and the narrowband NB515

gravity, enabling the identification of giant stars and foreground dwarfs. For
analysis, we selected a total of 6713 giant candidates using a Random Forest
regressor trained on medium-resolution (R ~ 6000) Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic
data. Our analysis reveals the extent of radial metallicity gradients in the
galaxies. Such trends, not detectable in earlier studies, are now captured
owing to the substantially enlarged sample size and areal coverage provided by
the HSC data. These results are also consistent with chemical abundance
patterns previously observed in the central regions through spectroscopic
studies. Furthermore, we infer that Fornax underwent extended star formation,
whereas Sculptor formed both metal-poor and metal-rich stars over a shorter
time. Ursa Minor and Draco appear to have experienced brief, intense star
formation episodes leading to nearly extinguished star formation. This study
underscores the critical role of the expanded HSC dataset in revealing chemical
gradients that were previously inaccessible. Future work incorporating
additional spectra of metal-poor stars and age-sensitive isochrone modeling
will enable more accurate maps of chemical abundance distributions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16664v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-resolution APEX/LAsMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (3-2) observation of

multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO
(3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to
identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have
significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios.
Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas
inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from
non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing
process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast
can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength
of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the
hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous
studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the
gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the
networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main
star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the
hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that
feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic
properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in
our previous studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16669v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observational Space Unveils Cosmic Expansion's Role in the Hubble

framework to extract the scale-dependent matter power spectrum $P(k, z)$ from
cosmic shear and CMB lensing measurements, parameterizing deviations from the
Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction as a free function $\alpha(k)$. Using public
data from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC Y3, and ACT DR6, we constrain $\alpha(k)$ with
fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference. Our results show a consistent 15-30\%
suppression in the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k \sim
0.1-1{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) in galaxy-lensing data relative to Planck, with combined
tensions reaching up to $4\sigma$ at fixed cosmology. In contrast, ACT CMB
lensing is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at ${k\lesssim 0.1 {\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$. We
validate our method using mock data, quantify consistency between datasets, and
demonstrate how the resulting $\alpha(k)$ likelihoods can be used to test
specific models for the power spectrum. All code, data products, and derived

linewidth of [C II] allow us to measure PDR expansion. Bubble-shaped regions
often exhibit expansion, while irregular-shaped ones are less likely to. Of the
35 HII regions, 12 (~34%) exhibit clear expansion in position-velocity (PV)

Blueshifted expansion is more common (eight ECs solely blueshifted; one
redshifted; three both), with mean velocities of ~10.9 km/s (blueshifted) and
~13.2 km/s (redshifted). A comparison of our observations to spherical

holds the promise of revealing the distribution of gas in the Universe,
characterizing the complex processes of galaxy formation and feedback, and
studying the epoch of reionization. Estimators for inhomogeneous screening,
including some recently proposed small-scale (stacked) estimators, are
quadratic or higher order in the CMB temperature or polarization fields and are
therefore subject to contamination from CMB lensing. We review the origin of
this lensing bias and show that, when stacking on unWISE galaxies, the expected
lensing bias dominates the signal if left unmitigated. Hardening techniques
that null the lensing bias have been proposed for standard quadratic
estimators, whereas only approximate methods have been proposed for stacked
estimators. We review these techniques and apply the former to stacked
estimators, presenting several strategies (including the optimal strategy) to
null lensing contamination when stacking on any large-scale structure (LSS)

shape, size, and color. Understanding how the outputs of galaxy model fitting
respond to weak-lensing shear distortions is crucial for accurate shear
estimation and mitigating shear-related systematics in weak lensing image
analyses. In this paper, we investigate how the fitted parameters -
specifically flux, size, and shape - respond to weak-lensing shear distortions
within the AnaCal framework. To achieve this, we introduce quintuple numbers, a
novel algebraic system inspired by dual numbers from automatic differentiation.
Quintuple numbers enable the propagation of shear response information
throughout the entire model-fitting process by linking analytical pixel shear
responses to those of the fitted parameters. We integrate quintuple numbers
into the AnaCal framework to derive the shear responses of shapes estimated
with model fitting and validate the pipeline using image simulations that
include realistic blending. Our results demonstrate that the multiplicative
bias remains below 0.003 for ground-based, oversampled images.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16517v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial magnetic fields and modified recombination histories</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jonathan Schiff, Tejaswi Venumadhav</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 39 pages, 14 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent cosmological data and astrophysical observations, such as the Hubble
tension and the increasing preference from galaxy surveys for dynamical dark
energy, have begun to challenge the standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter
cosmological model. Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to
alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These
fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up
recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last
scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the
radiative transport of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic
simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have
developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified
recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields
with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to
alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be
applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step
towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale
baryon clumping.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16408v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stabilizing simulation-based cosmological Fisher forecasts: a case study

from instability in derivative estimates, especially when the number of
simulations is limited. This instability reduces the reliability of Fisher
forecasts and machine learning based approaches that use derivatives. We
introduce a general framework that addresses this challenge by stabilizing the
input statistic and then systematically identifying the optimal subset of
summary statistics that maximizes cosmological information while simultaneously
minimizing the instability of predicted constraints. We demonstrate this
framework using the Voronoi volume function (VVF), a summary statistic that
captures beyond two-point clustering information. Applying our two-step
procedure -- random sub-sampling followed by optimization -- improves the
constraining power by up to a factor of 2, while also enhancing the stability
of the forecasts across realizations. As surveys like Euclid, DESI, and LSST
push toward tighter constraints, the ability to produce stable and accurate
theoretical predictions is essential. Our results suggest that new summary
statistics such as the VVF, combined with careful data curation and
stabilization strategies, can play a key role in next-generation precision
cosmology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16562v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PGPUC horizontal branch evolutionary tracks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A. A. R. Valcarce, M.

in understanding the life cycle of stars, particularly in the context of

chemical compositions, progenitor masses, and alpha-element distributions. The
aim is to provide a robust tool for interpreting HB stellar populations and
advancing our understanding of their diverse properties. The evolutionary
tracks are made publicly available through the PGPUC Online database for easy
access and interpolation. We computed over 19,000 HB evolutionary tracks
encompassing a wide range in terms of mass, metallicity, helium abundance, and
alpha-element enhancement, along with different progenitor masses. Using these

  Estimation: Reconciling DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon+ SNe Data Combination
  Results</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Seokcheon Lee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 3 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent cosmological parameter analyses combining DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) data with external probes, such as Pantheon+ Supernovae (SNe)
observations, have reported deviations of the dark energy equation-of-state
parameters ($\oo, \oa$) from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model predictions
($\oo=-1, \oa=0$). A notable aspect of these results is the role of $\Omo$
prior information from SNe, which is known to exhibit tension with BAO-only
constraints. In this study, we rigorously investigate this effect through a
statistical analysis using 100 mock DESI DR2 BAO data realizations. We
demonstrate that the strong degeneracy between $\oo$, $\oa$, and $\Omo$ causes
significant biases in the estimated dark energy parameters when the $\Omo$
prior mean deviates from its true underlying value. Specifically, applying an
$\Omo$ prior mean of 0.33 (consistent with some SNe-only constraints) to mock
data, assuming a true $\Lambda$CDM universe ($\Omo=0.30, \oo=-1, \oa=0$),
yields biased estimates such as $\oo \approx -0.82 \pm 0.06$ and $\oa \approx
-0.82 \pm 0.4$. This systematic shift, driven by the $\Omo$ prior, moves the
estimated parameters towards the non-$\Lambda$CDM region, offering a
qualitative resemblance to outcomes reported in current combined DESI DR2 BAO +
Pantheon+ SNe analyses (e.g., $\oo = -0.888^{+0.055}_{-0.064}$, $\oa = -0.17
\pm 0.46$). Our findings suggest that these observed non-$\Lambda$CDM
parameters may largely arise from statistical biases due to $\Omo$ prior
tensions between datasets. This study proposes a potential resolution to
current cosmological tensions without necessarily invoking new physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16462v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Bimodal Metallicity Distribution Function in the Ultra-Faint Dwarf

suppressed by reionization, but may not be completely quenched. The metallicity
distribution function (MDF) of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies could show
these signatures of reionization. However, past studies of UFD MDFs have been
limited, because there are only a few dozen red giant branch (RGB) stars in
such low-mass galaxies. We present low-resolution Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy
of 167 stars in the UFD Reticulum II ($M_* \approx 3000 M_\odot$), increasing
the number of stellar metallicities by 6.5 times and resulting in the most
populated spectroscopic metallicity distribution function of any UFD. This is
possible because we determined the first spectroscopic metallicities of main
sequence turn-off stars in any UFD. The MDF of Reticulum II is clearly a
bimodal distribution, displaying two peaks with about $80\%$ of the stars in
the metal-poor peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-3.0$ and $20\%$ of the stars in the more
metal-rich peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-2.1$. Such a large metallicity gap can be
explained by Type Ia supernova enrichment during a long quiescent period. This
supports the currently-favored two-burst star formation history for Reticulum
II and shows that such low-mass galaxies clearly can form stars after
reionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16071v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Massive Yellow Supergiant in the Far Outer Disk of M31: Evidence for

has long been assumed to require the high-density environments of inner
galactic disks. This paradigm is challenged by mounting evidence of young
massive stars in extended galaxy outskirts, yet direct confirmation of in situ
massive star formation in such extreme low-density environments remains scarce.
Here, we present the discovery of LAMOST J0048+4154, a massive yellow
supergiant situated at a deprojected galactocentric distance of ~34 kpc in M31,
making it the most distant massive star confirmed in this galaxy. Through
spectroscopic and photometric analyses, we classify J0048+4154 as an F5-F8I
supergiant with an effective temperature of $6357^{+121}_{-118}$ K and a
luminosity of $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to an
~18 $M_{\odot}$ progenitor and an age of ~10 Myr. FAST H I observations reveal
close spatial and kinematic alignment between the star and a faint H I external
arm, suggesting in situ formation in a region of low gas density. The presence
of other UV-bright, early-type stars in the vicinity further supports low-level
recent star formation in M31's very outer disk. These findings challenge the
prevailing assumption that massive star formation is confined to inner disks or
classical star-forming regions and underscore the need to re-examine the role
of spiral galaxy outskirts in fueling and sustaining star formation. J0048+4154
thereby expands our understanding of the extent of M31's young stellar
component and exemplifies how outer disks may harbor conditions conducive to
forming massive stars, despite low-density environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16154v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comprehensively Constraining Ultra-Light Primordial Black Holes Through

critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly
automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in
large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets
-- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for
rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a
conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for
augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains
visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate
that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to
the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables
generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and
advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML
pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting
completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object
detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (
$\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of
detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on
visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to
bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space
of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical

profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the
notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are
modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically
symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its
surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating
isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear
partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown
fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a
steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of
leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is
$\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the
centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our
dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those
found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our
previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid
element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre
are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or
transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow)
or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the
accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally,
under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with
$\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the
density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an
attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17105v1" target="_blank"><h2>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would
point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense
stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or
from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently
measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric
mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to
disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals.
Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a
relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its
gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no
indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular
binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies
found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical
differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger
event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We
present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of
GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field
triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if
GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field
triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active
galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a
viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of
eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for
constraining the disk geometry.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16569v1" target="_blank"><h2>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XVII: A Compact but

C$^{18}$O (2-1) molecular lines. The position-velocity diagrams of these lines
unveil a Keplerian-rotating disk with a radius of $\sim$21 au around a 1.3

red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au.
A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic
demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are
compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital
inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the
systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass
function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods,
eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a
pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of
1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios
follow a power-law distribution with slope -1.4; (f) tertiary orbits are
consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities,
subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a
publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations.
Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple
fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim
0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog

subsequently observed with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and one,

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that may otherwise remain undetected. Here, we
present an extended SMBH--Bulge mass scaling relationship using these lower
mass TDE black holes and their host galaxies. Bulge masses are derived using
Prospector fits to UV-MIR spectral energy distributions for the hosts of 40
TDEs that have a detected late-time UV/optical plateau emission, from which a
SMBH mass is derived. Overall, we find that TDE plateaus are a successful
method for probing BH scaling relations. We combine the observed TDE sample
with a higher mass SMBH sample and extend the known relationship, recovering a
steeper slope ($m = 1.34 \pm 0.03$) than current literature estimates, which
focus on the high mass regime. For the TDE only sample, we measure an equally
significant but shallower relationship with a power-law slope of $m = 1.17 \pm
0.10$ and significance $<0.001$. Forward modelling is used to determine whether
known selection effects can explain both the comparatively flatter TDE only
relation and the overall steepening across the full SMBH mass range. We find
that the flattening at TDE masses can be accounted for, however the steepening
can not. It appears that if a single slope extends for the whole BH mass range,
it must be steeper to include the TDE population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16896v1" target="_blank"><h2>COSMIC-L: A Photometric Catalog of Observed Stars in the Large

various evolutionary stages. In this work, we present an SDSS $gri$-bands
photometric analysis based on multiple images acquired with DECam, the Dark
Energy Camera, installed on the Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory (Chile). We performed a full image analysis and photometric
calibration, resulting in a photometric catalog named COSMIC-L, consisting of
57,997,665 stars, of which 18,676,294 contain estimates for all three $gri$
magnitudes, resulting in a completeness magnitude of $\simeq 21$ and a limiting
magnitude of $\simeq 22$ in all three bands.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16519v1" target="_blank"><h2>Insights gained from the Light Echo of Cepheus A HW2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bringfried Stecklum, Verena Wolf</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 3 pages, 5 figures, presented as ePoster at EAS 2025 annual meeting,this https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cepheus A HW2 is a well-studied massive young stellar object (MYSO) featuring
Class II methanol masers. Recently, certain maser components have been found to
flare every five years. This period went undetected in (NEO)WISE photometry due
to detector saturation. However, difference imaging revealed a light echo (LE),
representing a variability record. Its periodicity is similar to that of the
masers. Thereby, the mid-IR light curve since 2007 could be reconstructed.
Phase and period maps provide information on the circumstellar dust
distribution and viewing geometry. This is the first time an LE has been used
for reverberation mapping of a YSO environment and expanding its light curve
into the past.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16387v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial magnetogenesis from a supercooled dynamical electroweak phase
  transition</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Martin Arteaga Tupia, Anish Ghoshal, Alessandro Strumia</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 3 figures. Webinar presentation:this https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic
fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin.
Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical
electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended
by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new
scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter
candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating
temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics
also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial
black holes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17017v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmology of Cubic Poincaré Gauge gravity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sebastian Bahamonde, Rebecca Briffa, Konstantinos Dialektopoulos, Damianos Iosifidis, Jackson Levi Said</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 3 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> None found</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this paper, we study flat FLRW cosmology for a Poincar\'e gauge theory
containing cubic invariants that is free from ghosts in arbitrary backgrounds
in the axial and vector sectors of the torsion tensor. The new degrees of
freedom can be related to hypermomentum but continue to be dynamical even in
vacuum. These extra degrees of freedom open a more natural way in which to
construct potential gravitational models that provide possible ways to modify
astrophysical and cosmological physics. In this framework, we study two
particular branches of the theory where preliminary routes of exploring these
new variables are exposed. The first is the branch where the hypermomentum
vanishes, while the second branch involves the setting where the perfect fluid
and hypermomentum parts of the sources are independently conserved. In both
settings, we find generically faster expanding cosmologies with similar
estimates of the cosmic matter content as in the standard model of cosmology.
Cubic Poincar\'e Gauge gravity offers an interesting theoretical basis on which
to study cosmology, and indicates some preliminary positive constraints when
compared with observational constraints.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15965v1" target="_blank"><h2>Smooth hybrid inflation in light of ACT DR6 data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nobuchika Okada, Osamu Seto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> None found</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Smooth hybrid inflation is a hybrid inflation model which is free from
topological defects and predicts the density perturbation with the spectral
index of about $0.97$. We show that the prediction on the spectral index is
robust regardless the power of nonrenormalizable terms and meets with the
latest results reported by Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Viable scenarios for
baryogenesis and dark matter are also discussed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16922v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zi-Miao Huang, Zuowei Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 8 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> None found</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The extreme conditions within the supernova core, a high-temperature and
high-density environment, create an ideal laboratory for the search for new
physics beyond the Standard Model. Of particular interest are low-energy
supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong
constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We
compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and
axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass
above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are
dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the
low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in
the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to
$g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.</p></br></body>
