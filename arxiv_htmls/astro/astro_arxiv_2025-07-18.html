  morphology, and tangential anisotropy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Katrin Lehle, Mateusz Ruszkowski, Dylan Nelson, Marine Prunier, Annalisa Pillepich</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters
from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus
on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC)
clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field
strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and
redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces
reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters
spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work:
z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a
characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field
orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster
population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and
redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field
topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over
large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear
towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios
to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN
feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain
the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we
propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the
tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core
TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12702v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky
  Way</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Junichi Baba</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), kinematics (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its
mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational
potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$
kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear
stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies
remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling
and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics.
To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic
gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to
observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks,
dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate
synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity
method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed
terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature
arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity
method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$
kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner
gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass
concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not
require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming
motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear,
Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of
dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate
mass inference in the inner Milky Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12542v1" target="_blank"><h2>The halo magnetic field of a spiral galaxy at z=0.414</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Timea Orsolya Kovacs, Sui Ann Mao, Aritra Basu, Yik Ki Ma, B.

redshift evolution of galactic-scale magnetic fields is not well constrained
observationally. In this paper we aim to provide an observational constraint on
the time-scale of the mean-field dynamo, and derive the magnetic field in a
distant galaxy at $z=0.414$. We obtained broadband spectro-polarimetric $1-8$
GHz Very Large Array observation of the lensing system B1600+434, which is a
background quasar gravitationally lensed by a foreground spiral galaxy into two
images. We apply Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis and Stokes $QU$ fitting to
derive the RM of the two lensed images, which we use to estimate the lensing
galaxy's magnetic field. We measured the RM difference between the lensed
images, and detected Faraday dispersion caused by the magneto-ionic medium of
the lensing galaxy at $z=0.414$. Assuming that the RM difference is due to the
large-scale regular field of the galaxy's halo, we measure a coherent magnetic
field with a strength of $0.2 - 3.0\,\mu$G at 0.7 kpc, and $0.01 - 2.8 \,\mu$G
at 6.2 kpc vertical distance from the disk of the galaxy. We derive an upper
limit on the dynamo e-folding time: $\tau_{\rm dynamo} < 2.9~\times 10^8$~yr.
We find turbulence on scales below 50 pc, and a turbulent field strength of
$0.2 - 12.1 \, \mu$G. We measure the magnetic field in the halo of a spiral
galaxy, and find turbulence on scales of $ < 50$ pc. If the RM difference is due
to large-scale fields, our result follows the expectation from mean-field
dynamo theory, and shows that galaxies at $z \simeq 0.4$ already have magnetic
field strengths similar to present-day galaxies. However, we note the caveat of
the possibility of the turbulent field of the lensing galaxy contributing to
the observed RM difference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12520v1" target="_blank"><h2>MUSEing on the host galaxies of Tidal Disruption Events</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate
the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar
populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected
in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at
z < 0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher
redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at
z < 0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong
relation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs.
Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the
central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and
BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical
ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can
produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass
stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light
curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass
stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars
derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can
enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that
low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution,
unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13232v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unraveling the Feedback-Regulated Star Formation Activities around the

[HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is
located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images
(250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the
velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc,
distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a
centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an
enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR
images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an
arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust
condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of
12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the
periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm
the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO)
located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps
uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the
center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like
morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the
velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar
feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of
the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect
and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the
ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13160v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stochastic star formation activity of galaxies within the first billion

that exhibits a softer evolution than expected. In this work, we aim at
characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its
evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum
densities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at
6 < z < 12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce
the SEDs of z>6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when
applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed
stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies'
physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming
different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each
6 < z < 12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are
classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding
physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log
Mstar/Msun> 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to
0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only < 20% of
low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in
low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator
of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of
galaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to
0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9. We include additional constraints from
observations on sigmaUV and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and
0.06+/-0.01, for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither
alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z>10. Our results
add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely
responsible for the high-z UVLF.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12896v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fine-structure Line Atlas for Multi-wavelength Extragalactic Study

in the study of interstellar medium (ISM), leveraging comprehensive catalogs
and physical insights presented in our previous papers. We focus on key
questions of far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs): their origins,
diagnostic value, and implications of correlations. Our analysis reveals a
strong dependence on elemental abundance, so that FSL/H$\alpha$ traces
metallicity, [N II]/[C II] traces N/O, and $\sim$80% of [C II] emission arises
from neutral gas without systematic variations. We conclude a coherence exists
between the emissions from ionized and neutral gases regarding energy sources
and distribution. We argue that [C II] is physically a metallicity-dependent
star formation rate (SFR) tracer, while its correlations with atomic or
molecular gas masses are secondary. Crucially, the [C II] ``deficit'' is only
part of a universal ``deficit'' problem that shows in all neutral and ionized
gas lines including extinction-corrected H$\alpha$, caused by infrared (IR)
luminosities and characterized by a dichotomy in gas and dust behaviors. This
universal ``deficit'' marks a breakdown of the obscuration-corrected
star-formation rate (SFR) calibration and imperils SFR estimates. We argue that
it is caused by either IR ``excess'' or ionized gas ``deficit'', and present
possible scenarios. A renewed picture of ISM structure is needed to reconcile
with ionized--neutral gas coherence, metallicity dependence, and gas--dust
dichotomy. We also discuss differences of FIR FSL at high redshifts: the offset
in ``deficit'' trends, the similar [O III]/[C II] in metal-poor galaxies, and
elevated [O III]/[C II] in dusty galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13317v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing halo models for constraining astrophysical feedback with

with unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for
cosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies
in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution,
which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio
bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal
properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly
modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary
information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we
present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in
their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the
distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum
hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D
auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin
the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at
sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and
number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties,
such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo
mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require
further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength
datasets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12170v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measuring the IGM correlation length at 5 < z < 6.1: a fast change at the

late stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), particularly through the
presence of Gunn-Peterson troughs. These troughs span a broad range of lengths
(up to $\sim 100$ Mpc), suggesting large-scale coherent structures in the
intergalactic medium. We aim to gain insight into the presence, extent, and
magnitude of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $5 < z < 6.1$, and to
quantify the scales over which correlations are significant to inform on the
necessary volume for simulating the EoR. Using the extended XQR-30 dataset and
accounting for the relevant systematics, we compute the flux correlation matrix
and perform an MCMC analysis to quantify the extent and strength of the
correlation. To interpret our results, we compare to $1.5^3,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$
lightcones of Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission fluxes from several reionization
scenarios, including a fiducial box employing SCRIPT. We detect strong
correlations at $z > 5.3$, extending at least tens of Mpc and strongly
increasing with redshift. Our results suggest a redshift-dependent correlation
length, from $L \leq 26.53\, (68.47)$ Mpc at 1-$\sigma$ (2-$\sigma$) limit at
$z = 5.0$ to $L = 252.72^{+272.61}_{-41.61}$ Mpc at $z = 6.1$. In contrast, all
simulation models predict shorter correlation lengths ($< 60$ Mpc) and a slower
redshift evolution. The presence and redshift-dependence of correlations in the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest on $>200$ Mpc scales at $z=6$ indicates that cosmological
simulations should be larger than this scale to adequately sample the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Despite implementing a fluctuating UVB and numerous
neutral islands at $z < 6$, our fiducial SCRIPT-based simulation fails to
reproduce the large-scale correlations. It may be that those ingredients are
necessary, but not sufficient, to understanding the unfolding of the EoR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12530v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstruction of Dark Matter and Baryon Density From Galaxies: A

distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or baryons, from
observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use
the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered
around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine
learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved
field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether
machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or
the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different
approaches to reconstruct dark matter and baryons from galaxy data using the
CAMELS simulations. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach.
We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of
matter, baryons, halos and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our
results.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11829v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fine-structure Line Atlas for Multi-wavelength Extragalactic Study

Building on empirical relations established in our previous work, we use
photoionization models to systematically investigate the emission from both
ionized and neutral gas phases in a coherent structure. By applying power-law
fits to model parameters, we quantitatively capture how key FIR FSL ratios
scale with physical properties such as density, radiation field strength and
hardness, and elemental abundances. Our analysis confirms the primary
dependencies behind most observed empirical trends and establishes certain FIR
FSL ratios as tracers of physical parameters, while revealing that parameter
marginalization-particularly in density and the O/H-$U$-$Q_1/Q_0$
relation-plays a crucial role in shaping tight correlations seen in galaxies.
We also identify persistent challenges, including degeneracies between
ionization parameter and radiation field hardness, uncertainties in neutral gas
density, and difficulties in modeling dusty H II regions. We outline the
fundamental observational and theoretical limitations of current FIR FSL
diagnostics, and highlight prospects for advancing the field through
comprehensive, multi-wavelength studies of diverse galaxy populations.</p></br></body>
