Over a time span of between 0.6 to 5 rest-frame years, the Mg II trough outflowing at 12,000 km/s decreased in equivalent width by a factor of two and the Fe II troughs at the same velocity disappeared. The most likely explanation for the variability is that a structure in the BAL outflow moved out of our line of sight to the ultraviolet continuum emitting region of the quasar's accretion disk. Given the size of that region, this structure must have a transverse velocity of between 2600 km/s and 22,000 km/s. In the context of a simple outflow model, we show that this BAL structure is located between approximately 5800 and 46,000 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. That distance corresponds to 1.7 to 14 pc, 11 to 88 times farther from the black hole than the H-beta broad-line region. The high velocities and the parsec-scale distance for at least this one FeLoBAL outflow mean that not all FeLoBAL outflows can be associated with galaxy-scale outflows in ultraluminous infrared galaxies transitioning to unobscured quasars. The change of FBQS J1408+3054 from an FeLoBAL to a LoBAL quasar also means that if (some) FeLoBAL quasars have multiwavelength properties which distinguish them from HiBAL quasars, then some LoBAL quasars will share those properties. Finally, we extend previous work on how multiple-epoch spectroscopy of BAL and non-BAL quasars can be used to constrain the average lifetime of BAL episodes (currently >60 rest-frame years at 90% confidence).</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.6215v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JHU-SDSS metal absorption line catalog: redshift evolution and properties of Mg II absorbers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Guangtun Zhu, Brice Ménard</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title), quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a generic and fully-automatic method aimed at detecting absorption lines in the spectra of astronomical objects. The algorithm estimates the source continuum flux using a dimensionality reduction technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, and then detects and identifies metal absorption lines. We apply it to a sample of ~100,000 quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and compile a sample of ~40,000 Mg II & Fe II absorber systems, spanning the redshift range 0.4< z < 2.3. The corresponding catalog is publicly available. We study the statistical properties of these absorber systems and find that the rest equivalent width distribution of strong Mg II absorbers follows an exponential distribution at all redshifts, confirming previous studies. Combining our results with recent near-infrared observations of Mg II absorbers we introduce a new parametrization that fully describes the incidence rate of these systems up to z~5. We find the redshift evolution of strong Mg II absorbers to be remarkably similar to the cosmic star formation history over 0.4<z<5.5 (the entire redshift range covered by observations), suggesting a physical link between these two quantities.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00134v1" target="_blank"><h2>Broad Balmer Absorption Line Variability: Evidence of Gas Transverse Motion in the QSO SDSS J125942.80+121312.6</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xiheng Shi, Hongyan Zhou, Xinwen Shu, Shaohua Zhang, Tuo Ji, Xiang Pan, Luming Sun, Wen Zhao, Lei Hao</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title, abstract), outflow (abstract), QSO (title, abstract), BAL QSO (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report on the discovery of broad Balmer absorption lines variability in the QSO SDSS J125942.80+121312.6, based on the optical and near-infrared spectra taken from the SDSS-I, SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and TripleSpec observations over a timescale of 5.8 years in the QSO's rest-frame. The blueshifted absorption profile of H$β$ shows a variation of more than 5$σ$ at a high velocity portion ($>3000\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$) of the trough. We perform a detailed analysis for the physical conditions of the absorber using Balmer lines as well as metastable He I and optical Fe II absorptions ($λ4233$ from b$^4$P$_{5/2}$ level and $λ5169$ from a$^6$S$_{5/2}$) at the same velocity. These Fe II lines are identified in the QSO spectra for the first time. According to the photoionization simulations, we estimate a gas density of $n(\mathrm{H})\approx 10^{9.1}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and a column density of $N_{\mathrm{col}}(\mathrm{H})\approx 10^{23}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for the BOSS data, but the model fails to predict the variations of ionic column densities between the SDSS and BOSS observations if changes in ionizing flux are assumed. We thus propose transverse motion of the absorbing gas being the cause of the observed broad Balmer absorption line variability. In fact, we find that the changes in covering factors of the absorber can well-reproduce all of the observed variations. The absorber is estimated $\sim 0.94$ pc away from the central engine, which is where the outflow likely experiences deceleration due to the collision with the surrounding medium. This scheme is consistent with the argument that LoBAL QSOs may represent the transition from obscured star-forming galaxies to classic QSOs.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.15816v3" target="_blank"><h2>The XQR-30 Metal Absorber Catalog: 778 Absorption Systems Spanning 2 < z < 6.5</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rebecca L.

Large absorber samples are required to robustly measure typical absorber properties and to refine models of the synthesis, transport, and ionization of metals in the early Universe. The "Ultimate XSHOOTER legacy survey of quasars at z~5.8-6.6" (XQR-30) has obtained high signal-to-noise spectra of 30 luminous quasars, nearly quadrupling the existing sample of 12 high quality z~6 quasar spectra. We use this unprecedented sample to construct a catalog of 778 systems showing absorption in one or more of MgII (360 systems), FeII (184), CII (46), CIV (479), SiIV (127), and NV (13) which span 2 < z < 6.5. This catalog significantly expands on existing samples of z > 5 absorbers, especially for CIV and SiIV which are important probes of the ionizing photon background at high redshift. The sample is 50% (90%) complete for rest-frame equivalent widths W > 0.03AA (0.09AA). We publicly release the absorber catalog along with completeness statistics and a Python script to compute the absorption search path for different ions and redshift ranges. This dataset is a key legacy resource for studies of enriched gas from the era of galaxy assembly to cosmic noon, and paves the way for even higher redshift studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and 30m-class telescopes.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05131v2" target="_blank"><h2>Extent and structure of intervening absorbers from absorption lines redshifted on quasar emission lines</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jacqueline Bergeron, Patrick Boisse</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> molecular gas (abstract), quasar absorber (abstract), QSO (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We wish to study the extent and subparsec scale spatial structure of intervening quasar absorbers, mainly those involving neutral and molecular gas. We have selected quasar absorption systems with high spectral resolution and good S/N data, with some of their lines falling on quasar emission features. By investigating the consistency of absorption profiles seen for lines formed either against the quasar continuum source or on the much more extended emission line region (ELR), we can probe the extent and structure of the foreground absorber over the extent of the ELR (0.3-1 pc). The spatial covering analysis provides constraints on the transverse size of the absorber and thus is complementary to variability or photoionisation modelling studies. The methods we used to identify spatial covering or structure effects involve line profile fitting and curve of growth analysis.We have detected three absorbers with unambiguous non uniformity effects in neutral gas. For one extreme case, the FeI absorber at z_abs=0.45206 towards HE 0001-2340, we derive a coverage factor of the ELR of at most 0.10 and possibly very close to zero; this implies an absorber overall size no larger than 0.06 pc. For the z_abs=2.41837 CI absorber towards QSO J1439+1117, absorption is significantly stronger towards the ELR than towards the continuum source in several CI and CI* velocity components pointing to factors of about two spatial variations of their column densities and the presence of structures at the 100 au - 0.1 pc scale. The other systems with firm or possible effects can be described in terms of partial covering of the ELR, with coverage factors in the range 0.7 - 1. The overall results for cold, neutral absorbers imply a transverse extent of about five times or less the ELR size, which is consistent with other known constraints.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03368v2" target="_blank"><h2>Reionization and high-redshift galaxies: the view from quasar absorption lines</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  George D.

Towards this goal, quasar absorption lines play a unique role by probing the properties of diffuse gas on galactic and intergalactic scales. In this review we examine the multiple ways in which absorption lines trace the connection between galaxies and the IGM near the reionization epoch. We first describe how the Ly$α$ forest is used to determine the intensity of the ionizing ultraviolet background and the global ionizing emissivity budget. Critically, these measurements reflect the escaping ionizing radiation from all galaxies, including those too faint to detect directly. We then discuss insights from metal absorption lines into reionization-era galaxies and their surroundings. Current observations suggest a buildup of metals in the circumgalactic environments of galaxies over $z \sim 6$ to 5, although changes in ionization will also affect the evolution of metal line properties. A substantial fraction of metal absorbers at these redshifts may trace relatively low-mass galaxies. Finally, we review constraints from the Ly$α$ forest and quasar near zones on the timing of reionization. Along with other probes of the high-redshift Universe, absorption line data are consistent with a relatively late end to reionization ($5.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 7$); however the constraints are still fairly weak. Significant progress is expected to come through improved analysis techniques, increases in the number of known high-redshift quasars from optical and infrared sky surveys, large gains in sensitivity from next-generation observing facilities, and synergies with other probes of the reionization era.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00591v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Effect of Galactic Feedback on Gas Accretion and Wind Recycling</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Freeke van de Voort</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), feedback (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In the absence of galactic winds, the rate at which gas accretes onto galaxies is determined by the gravitational potential and by radiative cooling. However, outflows driven by supernovae and active galactic nuclei not only eject gas from galaxies, but also prevent gas from accreting in the first place. Furthermore, gas previously ejected from a galaxy can re-accrete onto (the same or a different) galaxy. Because this gas has a high metallicity, its cooling rate is relatively high, which will increase its chances to re-accrete. This complex interplay between gas inflows and outflows is discussed in this chapter. Wind recycling is found to be an important process that fuels galaxies at late times and the recycled gas has different properties than gas accreting for the first time. Quantitative conclusions, however, vary between studies, because the amount of wind recycling is dependent on the details of the feedback model. We discuss these differences, known caveats, and ways to make progress in understanding how galaxies are fed at low redshift.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14575v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Eddington Ratio Distribution of Narrow Line Active Galactic Nuclei</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Michael R.

We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$β$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$β$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\log_{10} M_\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3071v2" target="_blank"><h2>A Survey of Metal Lines at High-redshift (II) : SDSS Absorption Line Studies - OVI line density, space density and gas metallicity at z_abs ~ 3.0</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S.

Accounting for random interlopers mimicking an OVI doublet, we derive for the first time a secure lower limit for the redshift number density $ΔN / Δz$ for redshifts z_abs>2.8. With extensive Monte Carlo simulations we quantify the losses of absorbers due to blending with the ubiquitous Lyman forest lines, and estimate the success rate of retrieving each individual candidate as a function of its redshift, the emission redshift of the quasar, the strength of the absorber and the measured S/N of the spectrum by modelling typical Ly forest spectra. These correction factors allow us to derive the 'incompleteness and S/N corrected' redshift number densities of OVI absorbers :$ΔN _{OVI, c} / Δz_{c} (2.8 < z < 3.2) = 4.6+-0.3, at 3.2 < z < 3.6 = 6.7+-0.8,and at 3.6 < z < 4.0 = 8.4+-2.9. We can place a secure lower limit for the contribution of OVI to the closure mass density at the redshifts probed here: $Ω_{OVI} (2.8 < z < 3.2) >1.9x10^{-8} h^-1. We show that the strong lines we probe account for over 65\% of the mass in the OVI absorbers; the weak absorbers, while dominant in line number density, do not contribute significantly to the mass density. Making a conservative assumption about the ionisation fraction, and adopting the Anders (1989) solar abundance values, we derive the mean metallicty of the gas probed in our search : $ζ(2.8 < z < 3.2) > 3.6 x 10^-4 h, in good agreement with other studies. These results demonstrate that large spectroscopic datasets such as SDSS can play an important role in QSO absorption line studies, in spite of the relatively low resolution.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05199v1" target="_blank"><h2>Studying the Reionization Epoch with QSO Absorption Lines</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  George D.

This, in addition to the absorption at the host redshift and the other two intervening absorbers, takes the total to four (possibly five). The previous maximum number of 21-cm absorbers detected along a single sight-line is two and so we suspect that this number of gas-rich absorbers is in some way related to the very red colour of the background source. Despite this, no molecular gas (through OH absorption) has yet been detected at any of the 21-cm redshifts, although, from the population of 21-cm absorbers as a whole, there is evidence for a weak correlation between the atomic line strength and the optical--near-infrared colour. In either case, the fact that so many gas-rich galaxies (likely to be damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems) have been found along a single sight-line towards a highly obscured source may have far reaching implications for the population of faint galaxies not detected in optical surveys, a possibility which could be addressed through future wide-field absorption line surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.3875v2" target="_blank"><h2>The chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies with stellar and QSO dust production</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

It is therefore important to study he chemical evolution of galaxies by taking into account dust evolution. We aim at performing a detailed study of abundance ratios of high redshift objects and their dust properties. We focus on Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) and Quasar (QSO) hosts and likely progenitors of low- and high-mass present-day elliptical galaxies, respectively. We have adopted a chemical evolution model for elliptical galaxies taking account the dust production from low and intermediate mass stars, supernovae Ia, supernovae II, QSOs and both dust destruction and accretion processes. By means of such a model we have followed the chemical evolution of ellipticals of different baryonic masses. Our model complies with chemical downsizing. We made predictions for the abundance ratios versus metallicity trends for models of differing masses that can be used to constrain the star formation rate, initial mass function and dust mass in observed galaxies. We predict the existence of a high redshift dust mass-stellar mass relationship. We have found a good agreement with the properties of LBGs if we assume that they formed at redshift z=2-4. In particular, a non-negligible amount of dust is needed to explain the observed abundance pattern. We studied the QSO SDSS J114816, one of the most distant QSO ever observed (z=6.4), and we have been able to reproduce the amount of dust measured in this object. The dust is clearly due to the production from supernovae and the most massive AGB stars as well as from the grain growth in the interstellar medium. The QSO dust is likely to dominate only in the very central regions of the galaxies and during the early development of the galactic wind.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20299v3" target="_blank"><h2>The Cosmic Evolution of CIV Absorbers at $1.4<z<4.5$: Insights from $100,000$ Systems in DESI Quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Abhijeet Anand, J.

Using an automated matched-kernel convolution method with adaptive signal-to-noise thresholds, we identify $101,487$ CIV systems in the redshift range $1.4 < z < 4.5$ from $300,637$ quasar spectra. Completeness is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations and catalog is $50\%$ complete at $\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{CIV}} \geq 0.4$ Angstroms. The differential equivalent width frequency distribution declines exponentially and shows weak redshift evolution. The absorber incidence per unit comoving path increases by a factor of $2-5$ from $z \approx 4.5$ to $z \approx 1.4$, with stronger redshift evolution for strong systems. Using column densities derived from the apparent optical depth method, we constrain the cosmic mass density of CIV, $Ω_{\mathrm{CIV}}$, which increases by a factor of $\sim 3.8$ from $(0.82 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{-8}$ at $z \approx 4.5$ to $(3.16 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-8}$ at $z \approx 1.4$. From $Ω_{\rm CIV}$, we estimate a lower limit on intergalactic medium metallicity $\log(Z_{\rm IGM}/Z_{\odot}) \gtrsim -3.25$ at $z \sim 2.3$, with a smooth decline at higher redshifts. These trends trace the cosmic star formation history and HeII photoheating rate, suggesting a link between CIV enrichment, star formation, and UV background over $\sim 3$ Gyr.

The SDSS spectrum demonstrates that the absorption troughs can be divided into two components of blueshift velocities of $\sim$700 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$1400 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the quasar rest-frame. The former component shows rare Balmer absorption, which is an indicator of high density absorbing gas, thus the quasar is worth follow-up spectroscopic observations. Our follow-up optical and near-infrared spectra using MMT, YFOSC, TripleSpec and DBSP reveal that the strengths of the absorption lines vary for both of the two components, while the velocities do not change. We reproduce all of the spectral data by assuming that only the ionization state of the absorbing gas is variable and that all other physical properties are invariable. The variation of ionization is consistent with the variation of optical continuum from the V-band light-curve. Additionally, we can not interpret the data by assuming that the variability is due to a movement of the absorbing gas. Therefore, our analysis strongly indicates that the absorption line variability in LBQS 1206+1052 is photoionization-driven. As shown from photo-ionization simulations, the absorbing gas with blueshift velocity of $\sim$700 km s$^{-1}$ has a density in the range of $10^9$ to $10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and a distance of $\sim$1 pc, and the gas with blueshift velocity of $\sim$1400 km s$^{-1}$ has a density of $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ and a distance of $\sim$1 kpc.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4816v1" target="_blank"><h2>IGM Emission Observations with the Cosmic Web Imager: I.

Extensive extended emission is detected from the CQM, consistent with fluorescent and pumped Ly-alpha produced by the ionizing and Ly-alpha continuum of the QSO. Many features present in PCWI spectral images match those detected in narrow-band images. Filamentary structures with narrow line profiles are detected in several cases as long as 250-400 kpc. One of these is centered at a velocity redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity, and displays a spatially collimated and kinematically cold line profile increasing in velocity width approaching the QSO. This suggests that the filament gas is infalling onto the QSO, perhaps in a cold accretion flow. Because of the strong ionizing flux, the neutral column density is low, typically N(HI) is roughly 10E12-10E15/square-cm, and the line center optical depth is also low (typically tau0 is less than 10), insufficient to display well-separated double peak emission characteristic of higher line optical depths. With a simple ionization and cloud model we can very roughly estimate the total gas mass (log M(gas) equal to 12.5 +/- 0.5) and the total mass (log M(tot) equal to 13.3+/- 0.5). We can also calculate a kinematic mass from the total line profile (2x10E13 M(sun)), which agrees with the mass estimated from the gas emission. The intensity-binned spectrum of the CQM shows a progression in kinematic properties consistent with heirarchical structure formation.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00805v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas Accretion Traced in Absorption in Galaxy Spectroscopy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kate H.

Rubin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The positive velocity shift of absorption transitions tracing diffuse material observed in a galaxy spectrum is an unambiguous signature of gas flow toward the host system. Spectroscopy probing, e.g., NaI D resonance lines in the rest-frame optical or MgII and FeII in the near-ultraviolet is in principle sensitive to the infall of cool material at temperatures ~ 100-10,000 K anywhere along the line of sight to a galaxy's stellar component. However, secure detections of this redshifted absorption signature have proved challenging to obtain due to the ubiquity of cool gas outflows giving rise to blueshifted absorption along the same sightlines. In this chapter, we review the bona fide detections of this phenomenon. Analysis of NaI D line profiles has revealed numerous instances of redshifted absorption observed toward early-type and/or AGN-host galaxies, while spectroscopy of MgII and FeII has provided evidence for ongoing gas accretion onto >5% of luminous, star-forming galaxies at z ~ 0.5-1. We then discuss the potentially ground-breaking benefits of future efforts to improve the spectral resolution of such studies, and to leverage spatially-resolved spectroscopy for new constraints on inflowing gas morphology.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01989v3" target="_blank"><h2>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of Sub-Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers at z < 0.5, and Implications for Galaxy Chemical Evolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Debopam Som, Varsha P.

We measure the available neutrals or ions of C, N, O, Si, P, S, Ar, Mn, Fe, and/or Ni. Our data have doubled the sub-DLA metallicity samples at z<0.5 and improved constraints on sub-DLA chemical evolution. All four of our sub-DLAs are consistent with near-solar or super-solar metallicities and relatively modest ionization corrections; observations of more lines and detailed modeling will help to verify this. Combining our data with measurements from the literature, we confirm previous suggestions that the N(HI)-weighted mean metallicity of sub-DLAs exceeds that of DLAs at all redshifts studied, even after making ionization corrections for sub-DLAs. The absorber toward PHL 1598 shows significant dust depletion. The absorbers toward PHL 1226 and PKS 0439-433 show the S/P ratio consistent with solar, i.e., they lack a profound odd-even effect. The absorber toward Q0439-433 shows super-solar Mn/Fe. For several sub-DLAs at z<0.5, [N/S] is below the level expected for secondary N production, suggesting a delay in the release of the secondary N or a tertiary N production mechanism. We constrain the electron density using Si II* and C II* absorption. We also report different metallicity vs. Delta V_90 relations for sub-DLAs and DLAs. For two sub-DLAs with detections of emission lines from the underlying galaxies, our measurements of the absorption-line metallicities are consistent with the emission-line metallicities, suggesting that metallicity gradients are not significant in these galaxies.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7532v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Variable PV Broad Absorption Line and Quasar Outflow Energetics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Daniel M.

The viability of BAL outflows as a feedback mechanism depends on their kinetic energies, as derived from the outflow velocities, column densities, and distances from the central quasar. We estimate these quantities for the quasar, Q1413+1143 (redshift $z_e = 2.56$), aided by the first detection of PV $λλ$1118,1128 BAL variability in a quasar. In particular, PV absorption at velocities where the CIV trough does not reach zero intensity implies that the CIV BAL is saturated and the absorber only partially covers the background continuum source (with characteristic size <0.01 pc). With the assumption of solar abundances, we estimate that the total column density in the BAL outflow is log N_H > 22.3 (cm^-2). Variability in the PV and saturated CIV BALs strongly disfavors changes in the ionization as the cause of the BAL variability, but supports models with high-column density BAL clouds moving across our lines of sight. The observed variability time of 1.6 yr in the quasar rest frame indicates crossing speeds >750 km/s and a radial distance from the central black hole of <3.5 pc, if the crossing speeds are Keplerian. The total outflow mass is ~4100 M_solar, the kinetic energy ~4x10^54 erg, and the ratio of the outflow kinetic energy luminosity to the quasar bolometric luminosity is ~0.02 (at the minimum column density and maximum distance), which might be sufficient for important feedback to the quasar's host galaxy.</p></br></body>
