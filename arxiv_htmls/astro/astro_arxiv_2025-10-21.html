observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the
ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and
spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence
galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/$M_\odot$) > 9.5 to study their star formation,
chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements
resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales
make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and
evolution at z~5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In
this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a
summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure
spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test
different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of
H$\alpha$ halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70%
solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad
agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the
signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios.
Six show broad H$\alpha$ emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude
with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique
sample in forthcoming papers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16125v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effective cosmic ray diffusion in multiphase galactic environments</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Timon Thomas, Christoph Pfrommer, Rüdiger Pakmor, Rouven Lemmerz, Mohamad Shalaby</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 11 figures, comments are welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic-ray (CR) feedback is widely recognized as a key regulator of galaxy
formation. After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate
through the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale
distributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is
controlled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn
depends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave
damping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas,
ion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker
non-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and
slower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code
Arepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the
multiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion
coefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The
intrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of
CRs and Alfv\'en waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show
that the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation
speed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of
$10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau
damping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those
including both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds
increase systematically with gas density, for which we provide a
density-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate
that, despite strong ion-neutral damping in the cold and warm phases of the
galactic disk, CRs are transported at speeds only a few times the local
Alfv\'en speed as they traverse alternating ISM phases on their way out of the
galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16977v1" target="_blank"><h2>Studying the Dust Distribution Around Accreting Black Holes with

unresolved sources. One such type of variability study, called reverberation
mapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from
an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,
which demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the
accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a
corresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the
surrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been
learned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of
a potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust
outflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how
AGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%
of energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in
the near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust
sublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of
the dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the
dust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar
outflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics
(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to
high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated
from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and
ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed
modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the
distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to
the accretion disk luminosities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17518v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of Jet Density on Intracluster Medium Heating in Self-Regulated
  AGN Feedback Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tzu-Wei Tsai, Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), feedback (title, abstract), AGN (title, abstract), AGN feedback (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Active galactic nucleus (AGNs) feedback is widely accepted as the key
mechanism to suppress cooling flows in galaxy clusters. However, the dependence
of heating efficiency on jet properties is not fully understood. In this work,
we present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like
cluster, including both single-jet and self-regulated models, to investigate
how jet density affects bubble evolution and the thermal balance of the
intracluster medium. Our results confirm previous findings that lighter jets
inflate more spherical bubbles and are more easily deflected by cold gas,
enabling isotropic energy deposition throughout the cluster core. However,
despite their broader spatial impact, lighter jets display lower overall
heating efficiency, requiring higher average jet power to maintain
self-regulation compared to heavier jets. We also find that the distribution
and amount of cold gas significantly influence the effectiveness of jet
heating. These results highlight jet density as a critical parameter in AGN
feedback and emphasize the need to incorporate additional physical processes
such as magnetic fields, viscosity, and cosmic rays in future studies for
realistic comparisons with observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17804v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving the dusty star-forming galaxy GN20 at z=4.055 with NOEMA and

Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), dust (title, abstract), molecular gas (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present high-resolution (0.13"-0.23") NOEMA observations of the dust
continuum emission at 1.1 mm (rest-frame 220 micron) and JWST/NIRCam and MIRI
imaging of the z=4.055 starburst galaxy GN20. The sensitive NOEMA imaging at
1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5
kpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as
extended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with
a common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the
galaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the
nucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the
central 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5"-0.2"), implying that the starburst is very extended.
The combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent
interaction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface
brightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are
similar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more
concentrated. Through self-consistent radiative transfer modeling of the
integrated and resolved CO and dust emission, we derive an
$M_{mol}=2.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times10^{11}$ Msun with
$\alpha_{CO}=2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$. We find that the extended dust implies a lower
global dust optical depth than previously reported, but a high dust mass of
$M_{dust}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.6}\times 10^{9}$ Msun and gas-to-dust ratio of ~50.
Furthermore, we show the distinct apparent radial profiles of the gas and dust
can be explained purely by radiative transfer effects and the observations are
consistent with the gas and dust mass being similarly distributed throughout
the starburst. The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative
transfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from
different tracers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17693v1" target="_blank"><h2>Relics of High-redshift Compaction in our Backyard: The Most Metal-poor

the spatial, chemical, and kinematic properties of its most metal-poor stars
provide a unique fossil record of its proto-Galaxy phase. Understanding how
this ancient component formed is essential for linking near-field Galactic
archaeology to high-redshift galaxy evolution. We construct the currently
largest 3-D map of inner-Galaxy metal-poor giants by combining several
narrow/medium-band photometric surveys, reaching metallicities down to
[Fe/H]$\sim-$3.5. Comparing observational data with Auriga 18 (Au18) from the
Auriga cosmological simulations, we find that the proto-Galaxy population
([Fe/H]$\lesssim-$1.4) is highly centrally concentrated within the
Galactocentric distance $r_{\rm gc}\lesssim$15 kpc, and forms a
dispersion-supported structure with negligible rotation. The spatial and
chemo-dynamical properties of observed proto-Galaxy population closely match
those of the metal-poor stars in Au18. Considering Au18 as an analog of the MW,
we propose a new scenario in which the formation of the proto-Galaxy is linked,
for the first time, to episodes of high-z (z$\gtrsim$3) gas compaction,
blue-nugget phases, and quenching processes. This framework provides a unified
physical picture for the first $\sim$1-2 Gyr of the MW's evolution, bridging
local fossil records with future studies of early star-forming galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16106v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: The Fast Metal Enrichment of Massive

mass-metallicity-star formation relation ("fundamental metallicity relation";
FMR) of 18 massive (log(M/M$_\odot$) = 9.5-11) main-sequence galaxies at z~5
from the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample. This sample complements recent studies by
JWST at up to two orders of magnitude lower stellar masses. The metallicities
are derived using strong optical lines, and verified by temperature-based
oxygen abundance measurements for five galaxies for which faint auroral lines
are detected. We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between
z~5 and cosmic noon at z~2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times.
The FMR at z=5 exhibits a 5x larger scatter (preferentially to lower
metallicities) compared the local FMR relation. This scatter can be explained
by a bursty star formation and the direct build-up of metals in early galaxies
as well as differences in age and outflow efficiencies. Capitalizing on all
available samples, we find that the observed MZR and FMR over three orders of
stellar mass is generally in good agreement with results from cosmological
simulation, although some underestimate the metal enrichment at low stellar
masses. This may be due to too efficient metal-rich outflows. We show that the
ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST galaxies likely joined the current FMR at z~10 and will
evolve into massive (log(M/M$_\odot$)~11.4) galaxies with super-solar
metallicities by z=0.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16441v1" target="_blank"><h2>CO in MASsive Spirals (CO-MASS): an IRAM 30m CO emission line survey of

stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation
rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In
this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to
better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO
observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We
compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency
in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas
masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES
sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for
comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to
molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their
suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient
star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we
argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or
merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments.
Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of
lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic
component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end,
consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16584v1" target="_blank"><h2>CAZ catalog and optical light curves of 7918 blazar-selected AGN</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pouya M.

objects in the universe. Those with relativistic jets observed at small viewing
angles are blazars. Due to Doppler-boosting, blazars exhibit extreme stochastic
variability. While the origin of this variability is thought to be changes in
the accretion flow and jet dynamics, much about blazar variability remains
unknown. In this paper we use several blazar-dominated AGN samples to form a
catalog of 7918 blazars and candidates -- the largest to date. We also collect
source types, redshifts, spectral energy distribution (SED) peak frequencies,
radio variability Doppler factors, and X-ray flux densities for as many sources
as possible. We use all-sky surveys (CRTS, ATLAS, and ZTF, abbreviated as
``CAZ'') to extract their optical multiband flux density on a nightly basis
between 2007 and 2023, and construct as long and as high cadence light curves
as possible for as many sources as attainable. The catalog and its light curves
are provided in the accompanying electronic tables, enabling many analyses
involving AGN variability with unprecedented sample-sizes. We quantify the
variability of the light curves, and apply the Bayesian blocks algorithm to
determine their flaring periods. We find: (1) optical flares generally have a
faster rise than decay; (2) optical brightness and variability are strongly
dependent on the synchrotron peak frequency; (3) flat spectrum radio quasars
and BL Lac objects have comparable optical variability and flare
characteristics at the same synchrotron peak frequency; and (4) optical flare

calibration procedure, including local background subtraction, light-leakage
masking, stripe removal, and astrometry refinement, we achieve robust
emission-line mapping on kiloparsec scales. Although line-ratio distributions
vary across galaxies in our sample, we generally find mild central enhancements
in [O\,\textsc{iii}]/H$\beta$, [O\,\textsc{ii}]/[O\,\textsc{iii}],
[S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6732}$/[S\,\textsc{ii}]$_{6718}$, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and
$L_{\rm H\alpha}/L_{\rm UV}$, consistent with elevated electron density, dust
obscuration, and bursty star formation accompanied by reduced metallicity and
ionization parameter. These features point to inside-out growth fueled by
recent inflows of pristine gas. Nevertheless, the median metallicity gradient
is nearly flat over a few kpc scale, $\Delta \log({\rm O/H}) = 0.02 \pm 0.01$
dex kpc$^{-1}$, implying efficient chemical mixing through inflows, outflows,
and mergers. From pixel-by-pixel stellar and emission-line characterizations,
we further investigate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR).
Metallicity is described by a fundamental plane with stellar mass and SFR
surface densities, but with a stronger dependence on $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ than
seen in local galaxies. Our results indicate that the regulatory processes
linking star formation, gas flows, and metal enrichment were already vigorous
$\sim$1 Gyr after the Big Bang, producing the nearly flat metallicity gradient

dispersion of the H-alpha line, and we propose a new diagnostic based on the
ratio between the velocity dispersions of the [N II] 6584 and H-alpha lines to
disentangle the relative roles of AGN, shocks and H II regions. Many regions,

their line ratios (high [N II]6584/H-alpha and intermediate [O III]5007/H-beta)
and their location between H II and AGN regimes. This improved selection of H
II-like regions enables robust oxygen abundance estimates using the N2
indicator. Most galaxies show negligible metallicity gradients, especially
low-abundance (< 8.37 dex) fast rotators, with an average slope of 0.005 dex
Re^-1 and a dispersion of 0.42 dex Re^-1. Above 8.37 dex, fast rotators display

with two prevailing theories -- ``warm corona'' and ``ionized reflection'' --
dominating the discussion. In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from
upscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV
emission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the
illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily
correlate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of
the series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a
sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \citet{Chen+2025a}. Our
extensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV
that remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim
10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still
statistically significant ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$). These
findings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome
of the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is
essential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally,
we report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index
($\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential
competition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the
$\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a
much weaker correlation with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\mathrm{null}=2\times
10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature. This highlights the
critical role of accurately modeling SE in studies of the
$\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$--$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16734v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing down to early cosmic epochs using limited redshift ($z\lesssim

galaxy evolution using optical spectral diagnostics using ESO-GOODS-S data. We
employ traditional Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams along with their
modern extensions, the Mass-Excitation (MEx) and Colour-Excitation (CEx)
diagrams, to classify AGNs from among up to 600+ candidates. We extract the
spectral properties utilising an indigenous spectral fitting code. In addition,
the code also incorporates inputs from a state-of-the-art stellar population
synthesis model (Bruzual and Charlot, 2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000), extracting the
host galaxy ages and metallicities as model parameters. Redshift values for all
the studied spectra are obtained from the literature. Using these redshift
values, we are able to assign a 'lookback time' (using standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological parameters). When this lookback time is combined with the galaxy
ages (from spectral fitting), it enables us to study galaxy evolution even up
to early cosmological epochs ($\sim$13 Gyr), despite restricting the studied
field of galaxies to $z\sim 1$ (lookback time of $\sim$8 Gyr). We conclude that
galaxies ultimately evolving into AGN hosts originate earlier ($\sim$8 Gyr ago)
than non-AGN host galaxies ($\sim$6 Gyr ago). We relate this fact, that AGN
hosts date back to an earlier epoch than non-AGN galaxies, as being likely due
to higher cosmic temperatures at that time, probably enhancing black hole
accretion. We emphasise that host galaxy age is an additional crucial parameter
(apart from cosmological redshift) in defining our understanding of AGN and
star formation co-evolution across cosmological time scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16553v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM-Subaru views of Abell 754: Energetic ICM Motions Revealed by

Abell~754 using \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. In GO1 phase, \textit{XRISM}/Resolve
observed Abell 754 in two deep pointings, targeting the eastern primary core
(114~ks) and the middle of the X-ray filamentary structure (190~ks). Spectral
fits to full field-of-view data reveal a line-of-sight velocity difference of
$656 \pm 35$~km~s$^{-1}$ between the two pointing, corresponding to a bulk Mach
number of 0.45$\pm$0.03. Velocity dispersions are measured to be
$220^{+26}_{-29}$~km~s$^{-1}$ and $279^{+24}_{-23}$~km~s$^{-1}$ in the eastern
and middle pointing, respectively. Within the eastern core, the velocity
dispersion shows spatial variation, reaching $497^{+144}_{-117}$~km~s$^{-1}$ in
the southern core with high temperature -- among the largest values yet
reported in galaxy clusters to date. Narrow-band analysis of the Fe--K complex
in this region reveals systematically higher temperatures derived from He-like
and H-like Fe line ratio compared to those obtained via broadband fits,
indicating multi-phase structures. Two-temperature modeling further separates a
cooler core phase from a hotter, shock or turbulence-heated phase whose
velocity is blueshifted, similar to that of the middle pointing. These results
point to a mixing interface where post-shock gas from the south overlaps, in
projection, with cooler core gas, inflating the observed line widths in this
region. Weak-lensing analysis with Subaru/HSC and Suprime-cam confirms that the
eastern component is about twice as massive as the western one, consistent with
disruption and gas stripping of the latter. The curved morphology of the
eastern X-ray core, together with the measured kinematics, is naturally
explained by an off-axis, post--core-passage merger that imparts angular
momentum and drives large-scale rotational and fallback flows.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16099v1" target="_blank"><h2>The SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping Project: Light Echoes

lines," which are a species of emission lines present in AGN spectra with high
ionization potentials ($\geq$ 100 eV) that can serve as tracers for AGN
activity. The spatial extent of the coronal line region has been studied with
only spatial resolving techniques that are not sensitive to the innermost
regions of AGN. Through our reverberation mapping analysis of [Ne
V]$\lambda$3427, we measure a nominal `optimal emission radius' for [Ne
V]$\lambda$3427 of $381.1^{+16}_{-22}$ light days (observed-frame). We place
the coronal line region in context with other AGN regions by comparing it with
the characteristic radius of H$\alpha$, the dust-sublimation radius, and the
dusty torus. The coronal line region is located at a larger radius from the
black hole than the characteristic radius of the dusty torus, measured using a
torus-radius luminosity relationship. The virial product ($v^2 R/G$) of both
H$\alpha$ and [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is consistent within the uncertainties,
implying that the coronal line region, as probed by the [Ne V]$\lambda$3427

potential of the black hole. This plausibly suggests that coronal lines could
be an effective method for estimating black hole masses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16705v1" target="_blank"><h2>The origin of the spectral versus dynamical age discrepancy in radio

how this structure affects the radio spectrum of the lobes. It has previously
been argued that lobe ages inferred from radio spectra underestimate the true
ages of radio galaxies due to re-acceleration of electrons in the lobe, mixing
of electron populations, or the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the
lobes. We find that the spectral ages with and without accounting for the lobe
magnetic field structure are consistent with each other, suggesting that mixing
of radiating populations of different ages is the primary cause of the
underestimation of radio lobe ages. By accounting for the structure of lobe
magnetic fields, we find greater spectral steepening in the equatorial regions
of the lobe. We demonstrate that the assumptions of the continuous injection,
Jaffe-Perola, and Tribble models for radio lobe spectra do not hold in our
simulations, and we show that young particles with high magnetic field
strengths are the dominant contributors to the overall radio lobe spectrum.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16249v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accretion and Jet Coupling in Powerful Radio Quasars at Cosmic Noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mojegan Azadi, Belinda Wilkes, Joanna Kuraszkiewicz, Steven.

radio-loud quasars from the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Galaxies
(3CRR) at 1 < z < 2. The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the
intrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range
1{\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over
inclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use
accretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the
unobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV
gap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400)
across different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray
luminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of
these intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is
divided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly
different values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher
Eddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity
and accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes
roughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact
jets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This
suggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio
luminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated
bolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to
powerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16210v1" target="_blank"><h2>The factors that influence protostellar multiplicity II. Gas temperature

To fully understand the formation and evolution of these systems, the physical
parameters of the molecular gas together with the dust must be systematically
characterized. Using observations of molecular gas tracers, we characterize the
physical properties of cloud cores in the Perseus molecular cloud (average
distance of 295 pc) at envelope scales (5000-8000 AU). We used Atacama
Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Nobeyama 45m Radio Observatory (NRO)
observations of DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in several transitions to
derive the physical parameters of the gas toward 31 protostellar systems in
Perseus. Gas kinetic temperature was obtained from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and
c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios. Column densities and gas masses were then calculated
for each species and transition. Gas kinetic temperature and gas masses were
compared with bolometric luminosity, envelope dust mass, and multiplicity to
search for statistically significant correlations. Gas kinetic temperature
derived from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios have average values
of 14 K, 26 and 16 K, respectively, with a range of 10-26 K for DCO$^+$ and
c-C$_3$H$_2$. The gas kinetic temperature obtained from H$_2$CO line ratios
have a range of 13-82 K. Column densities of all three molecular species are on
the order of 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, resulting in gas masses of
10$^{-11}$ to 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Statistical analysis of the physical
parameters finds: i) similar envelope gas and dust masses for single and binary
protostellar systems; ii) multiple (>2 components) protostellar systems tend to
have slightly higher gas and dust masses than binaries and single protostars;
iii) a continuous distribution of gas and dust masses is observed regardless of

sensitivity to cosmological parameters. However, traditional 3D galaxy-based
void finding is limited by many factors, including uncertainties in the
galaxy-halo connection and distortions from redshift errors. Using alternative
tracers and new 2D void definitions can alleviate these limitations and be
tailored to maximise the signal for specific observables. Here, we introduce
Cosmic Tunnels, a new class of 2D void-like objects traced by galaxy clusters,
corresponding to large underdense lines of sight.
  We identify Cosmic Tunnels by applying the tunnel algorithm to the RASS-MCMF
and ACT-MCMF cluster catalogues. We validate their void-like nature by
measuring the cross-correlation of Cosmic Tunnels with galaxy density contrast
maps from the DESI Legacy Survey (measured at 63$\sigma$ significance), galaxy
weak-lensing maps from DES Y3 (31$\sigma$), and CMB weak-lensing maps from ACT
DR6 (15$\sigma$), all of which show underdense interiors enclosed by
compensation ridges, consistent with 3D galaxy voids, measured at high
statistical significance. We also show that the lensing profiles fit the
universal HSW void profile, further validating their void-like nature.
  We cross-correlate the Cosmic Tunnels with Planck CMB temperature maps to
measure the ISW signal. Using the ACT-MCMF Cosmic Tunnels, we achieve a
3.6$\sigma$ ISW detection, one of the highest significances ever reported from
a single tracer catalogue. These results confirm that Cosmic Tunnels are robust
underdense structures and demonstrate their potential as a new tool for
cosmological analyses. Finally, we report a tentative detection of a sign flip
in the ISW signal at very low redshift (z < 0.03), consistent with previous
studies, challenging the standard $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$ paradigm.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16585v1" target="_blank"><h2>Association of the IceCube neutrinos with CAZ blazar light curves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pouya M.

hundreds of high-energy (HE) neutrinos from cosmic sources. Despite numerous
studies searching for their origin, it is still not known which source
populations emit them. A few confident individual associations exist with
active galactic nuclei (AGN), mostly with blazars which are jetted AGN whose
jet points in our direction. Nonetheless, on a population level,
blazar-neutrino correlation strengths are rather weak. This could mean that
blazars as a population do not emit HE neutrinos, or that the detection power
of the tests is insufficient due to the strong atmospheric neutrino background.
By assuming an increase in HE neutrino emission during major blazar flares, in
our previous studies we leveraged the arrival time of the neutrinos to boost
the detection power. In this paper we utilize the same principle while
substantially increasing the number of blazars. We search for the
spatio-temporal correlation of 356 IceCube HE neutrinos with major optical
flares of 3225 radio- and 3814 $\gamma$-ray-selected blazars. We find that,
despite the increase in data size, the number of confident spatio-temporal
associations remains low and the overall correlation strengths weak. Two
individual associations drive our strongest and the only $>$2$\sigma$
post-trial spatio-temporal correlation, occurring with the BL Lac objects of
the radio-selected blazar sample. We estimate that $\lesssim$8\% of the
detected cosmic neutrinos were emitted by blazars during major optical flares.
As a complementary analysis, we compare the synchrotron peak frequency,
redshift, Doppler factor, X-ray brightness, and optical variability of
spatially neutrino-associated blazars to those of the general blazar
population. We find that spatially neutrino-associated blazars of the tested
samples have higher than average Doppler factor and X-ray brightness.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17125v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Stars to Waves: Non-deterministic Inference of Microlensed

lensing galaxy with additional modulations (on both phase and amplitude) due to
gravitational microlensing effect of stars/remnants near the line of sight.
These microlensed waveforms depend on the mass and location of thousands or
more most relevant stars, so that their deterministic reconstruction from the
data is computationally prohibitive. We classify the detection and parameter
estimation of such events as non-deterministic inference problem and propose a
solution with the implementation of normalizing flows. As a first step, we show
that $8\%$ of microlensed events can be detected with significance $\ge 3
\sigma$ in the third generation era, with the chosen microlensing parameters
correlated with the density of the underlying stellar field. This approach
opens the door to probing microlensing effects and the properties of the
underlying stellar fields. A similar construction may also be applied to other
non-deterministic inference problems, such as detecting post-merger
gravitational waves from binary neutron star coalescence and signals from

structure called accretion discs(ADs). Conventional AD theory usually supposes
that the gravitational field is controlled by a central compact object. This
assumption breaks down when the mass of the disc becomes considerable in
contrast to that of the massive central object. In these cases, the AD's
self-gravity (SG) can drastically change its structure, dynamics, and
evolution. This review investigates how SG influences the radial and vertical
structure of ADs and how it modifies the mechanisms that transport angular
momentum (AM). Along with these, this review also tries to explore how
gravitational instabilities (GIs) evolve and how they affect disc fragmentation

central soliton, (2) the self-gravity of the stars, (3) the suppression of
heating in a tidally stripped halo, and (4) the tidal field suppression of
heating when the stellar cluster is much smaller than the de Broglie

relations for the subhalo mass components. We test and compare 11 total mass
parametrisations of the galaxy cluster with increasing complexity. To do so, we
employ the new parametric strong lensing modelling code Gravity.jl. Our best
fit total mass parametrisation is characterised by a single large scale halo,
179 subhalo components, and an external shear term. The reference model yields
a mean scatter between the model predicted and observed positions of the
multiple images of 0.32 arcseconds. We are able to quantify the systematics
arising from our modelling choices by taking advantage of all the different

grow at a significantly slower, sub-Eddington rate. By redshift $z\sim 10$ the
black hole mass with an initial super-Eddington jump-start is caught up by that
in the case with a steady Eddington limited case. Thus a continuous Eddington
limit case represents the fastest possible route to maximally grow SMBHs. To

and molecular abundances in the icy dust mantles by fitting the spectrum in the
6.8-8.4 $\mu$m range with a large sample of laboratory ice spectra using the
ENIIGMA fitting tool or the local continuum method. We found differences in the
simple and COM ice abundances with respect to H$_2$O ice between ST6 and
Galactic protostars that likely reflect differences in metallicity and UV flux.
More laboratory ice spectra of COMs are needed to better reconstruct the
observed infrared spectra of protostars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17696v1" target="_blank"><h2>Clumpy Outflows from Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes I: Radiation

to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the
supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating
detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows.
In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial
and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington
accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy
outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles,
exhibiting typical properties such as a size of ~10 rg (where rg is the
gravitational radius), a velocity of ~0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of
light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities
are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained
from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of
10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is
approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are
considered to originate from the region within <~300 rg.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16121v1" target="_blank"><h2>GRB 230307A Formed No Dust or Was Not a Binary Neutron Star Merger</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Prasiddha Arunachalam, Phillip Macias, Ryan.

2023vfi), a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with an infrared excess and spectral
lines suggestive of significant heavy $r$-process production. The spectra,
taken 29 and 61~days after the GRB trigger, have blackbody-like continua with
$T_{\rm eff} \approx 550$ K and an emission line near $2.1$ $\mu$m, previously
attributed to [Te III]. This line identification has been used as evidence for
an $r$-process-powered kilonova (KN), despite no KN model producing a
blackbody-like spectrum at late times. Such an infrared continuum could be
emitted by newly formed dust, and we model the thermal emission to infer dust
properties, including composition and mass. We find that the emission requires
at least 3--$6 \times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ of carbon or silicate dust, which is
inconsistent with $r$-process yields expected from a neutron star merger.
Alternatively, the continuum could be from $2\times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ of
metallic iron dust, which is mildly consistent (at 3$\sigma$) with KN models,
but such dust is unlikely to form in the expanding ejecta. GRB 230307A's low
late-time luminosity also constrains the amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni
produced to $< 2.6 \times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ (3$\sigma$). No KN model can
simultaneously form the necessary dust for the infrared continuum and heavy
elements for the [Te III] line. We conclude that the blackbody continuum is not
due to dust emission, or GRB 230307A did not originate from a binary
compact-object merger.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16291v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM-Subaru views of Abell 754: an off-axis, near-line-of-sight merging

754 and impose constraints on the merger trajectory. The trajectory analysis
adopts a two-body model with a point-mass approximation and dynamical friction,
refined using numerical simulations of major mergers and characterized by Euler
angles. We first conduct WL analysis using the two-dimensional shear pattern
from the Subaru HSC in combination with Suprime-Cam images to assist in color
selection. The WL mass map shows a distinct double-peak structure located
around the western and eastern brightest cluster galaxies as reported in the
literature. The two-halo component analysis, which utilizes the 2D shear
pattern over the cluster entire region and considers the lensing covariance
matrix from uncorrelated large-scale structures, indicates mass values of
$M_{200}^W=3.13_{-1.00}^{+1.53}\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and
$M_{200}^E=6.41_{-1.97}^{+2.92}\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. Thus, the
eastern mass component associated with the X-ray tadpole-shaped gas is the main
cluster. No substantial structural components are detected in the line-of-sight
velocities of the member galaxies. Utilizing WL parameters, line-of-sight
velocities, and X-ray information on morphology and kinematics, we determine an
impact parameter of approximately 0.77 Mpc at an initial separation of 2 Mpc
from the main cluster. The merger plane is inclined at about 20 degrees
relative to the line-of-sight. Interestingly, this system is an off-axis,
near-line-of-sight merger. This characteristic arises because the trajectory
within the merger plane is altered during the pericenter passage, causing the
apparent motion to transition from predominantly along the line-of-sight before
the core passage to mainly within the plane of the sky afterward. This study
will assist in conducting numerical simulations to understand the XRISM
observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17592v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid preparation: The flat-sky approximation for the clustering of

form the background to possible additional contributions, is the chain decay of
$\pi^+$ produced in the inelastic interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar
and circumstellar gas. The shape of the energy spectrum of positrons produced
in these pion decays can be calculated exactly and is well known. However,
surprisingly, some estimates of the contribution of the standard mechanism to
the positron flux have adopted an incorrect spectral shape of the positron
produced in these decays, following an error present in a 1997 paper of
Moskalenko and Strong. In this work we report this error, discuss its origin,

evolution in $f(R)$ gravity by employing a \textit{spectral Chebyshev
collocation approach}. Unlike standard integration methods such as Runge--Kutta
that often encounter stiffness and accuracy issues, this formulation expands
the normalized Hubble function $E(z) = H(z)/H_0$ as a finite Chebyshev series.
The modified Friedmann equation is then enforced at selected
Chebyshev--Gauss--Lobatto points, converting the original nonlinear
differential equation into a system of algebraic relations for the series
coefficients. This transformation yields exponentially convergent and
numerically stable solutions over the entire redshift domain, $0 < z < z_{max}$,
eliminating the need for adaptive step-size control. We apply the method to two
widely studied $f(R)$ models, Hu--Sawicki and Starobinsky, and perform a
combined analysis using cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data and the Union~3.0
supernova compilation. The reconstructed expansion histories match observations
to within $2\sigma$ over $0 < z < 2$, producing best-fit parameters of
approximately $(\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}) \simeq (0.29, 68,
1.2\text{--}2.5\,H_0^2)$. These results indicates that both models reproduce
the observed late-time acceleration while permitting small geometric
corrections to $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, the spectral Chebyshev method provides a
precise and computationally efficient framework for probing modified-gravity
cosmologies in the precision-data era.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17323v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Common Synchrotron Origin for Prompt Gamma-Ray and Soft X-Ray Emission

Monitor (SVOM) mission have led to the detection of a growing number of long
GRBs with significant, early soft X-ray flux during their gamma-ray emission,
prompting the question of whether their multi-band prompt emission shares a
common origin in region and mechanism. To address this, we utilize the 20-year
Swift archival data, which provides a substantial sample of joint soft X-ray
and gamma-ray observations, enabling a systematic joint spectral study. We
resolve 110 temporal pulses from 46 GRBs and find that a single power-law model
with a low-energy break or cutoff adequately describes the prompt spectra from
150 keV down to 0.5 keV. More than half of the sample pulses require a break
around a few keV, with average spectral indices $\langle \alpha_1 \rangle =
-0.88$ and $\langle \alpha_2 \rangle = -1.46$ consistent with synchrotron
radiation in a marginally fast-cooling regime. The observed spectral evolution
and the distribution of indices support a single-emission-region origin, where
the varying spectral shapes are largely governed by the evolution of the
synchrotron cooling frequency $\nu_c$ and the effect of finite emission width.
The observed differences in the temporal behavior between X-ray and gamma-ray
light curves can be naturally explained by this spectral evolution across the
broad band.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17219v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measurement of the Iron Spectrum with the MAGIC Telescopes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M. Molero, S.

TeV, with their production thought to be primarily originated by astrophysical
sources. Therefore, measuring the iron spectrum provides crucial insights into
the origin, acceleration, and propagation mechanisms of cosmic rays. While
recent results from space-based detectors have revealed unexpected energy
dependences in the GeV-TeV range, these measurements are limited by low
statistics at higher energies. At energies above a few TeV, ground-based
detectors, such as the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC)
telescopes, become more effective due to their large collec- tion areas,
enabling them to extend and complement the capabilities of space-borne
instruments. In this work, we apply the so-called direct Cherenkov technique,
which accounts for the radiation emitted by charged particles before the
cascade develops in the atmosphere, with MAGIC to identify iron-induced air
showers and distinguish them from those produced by lighter cosmic-ray species.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17796v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological constraints from the angular power spectrum and bispectrum

the DESI Legacy Survey, combining their angular power spectrum, bispectrum, and
cross-correlation with maps of the CMB lensing convergence from the Planck
satellite. We employ a perturbative bias expansion in Eulerian space to
describe the clustering of galaxies, modelling the power spectrum and
bispectrum at one-loop and tree level, respectively. This allows us to use the
power spectrum to self-consistently calibrate the perturbative bias parameters.
We validate this model against an $N$-body simulation, and show that it can be
used up to scales of at least $k_{\rm max}^P\simeq 0.2\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and
$k_{\rm max}^B\simeq 0.08\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, saturating the information
recovered from the data. We obtain constraints on the amplitude of matter
fluctuations $\sigma_8=0.761\pm 0.020$ and the non-relativistic matter fraction
$\Omega_m=0.307\pm 0.015$, as well as the combination
$S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.769 \pm 0.020$. Including the galaxy
bispectrum leads to a $10$-$20\%$ improvement on the cosmological constraints,
which are also in good agreement with previous analyses of the same data, and
in mild tension with Planck at the $\sim2.5\sigma$ level. This tension is
largely present in the standard two-point function dataset, and the addition of
the bispectrum increases it slightly, marginally shifting $\sigma_8$ downwards
and $\Omega_m$ upwards. Finally, using the bispectrum allows for a
substantially more precise measurement of the bias parameters of this sample,

the prompt emission and the afterglow radiation, and its rapid flux decline is
often interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission. As such, it can offer
insights into the emission mechanisms active during the prompt emission and the
physics of GRB jets. In this work, we focus on merger-driven GRBs, which are
sources of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by ground-based
interferometers, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We present a systematic
analysis of the early X-ray emission ($t < 10^3 \ \mathrm{s}$) of a sample of
16 merger-driven GRB candidates detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
(hereafter, Swift). We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of soft and
hard X-ray data (0.3-150 keV) by fitting two curved spectral models to the
spectra: a physical synchrotron model and an empirical smoothly broken power
law model. We characterized the evolution of the peak energy and bolometric
flux, and derived the intrinsic properties of the 10 bursts with measured
redshift. We discovered a tight correlation between the rest-frame peak energy
of the spectra and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity. Specifically, we
obtained $\nu_{c,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.64 \pm 0.03)}$ when adopting the
synchrotron model, and $E_{p,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.58 \pm 0.04)}$ when
adopting the smoothly broken power law. Both relations were extrapolated to the
typical prompt emission energies and well describe the properties of short GRBs
detected in the MeV gamma-rays. These results suggest a common origin for the
prompt and steep-decay emissions in merger-driven GRBs, and rule out
high-latitude emission as the dominant process shaping the early X-ray tails.
Finally, we assessed the detectability of these sources with the Wide-field
X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe mission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16574v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Manticore-Local Cluster Catalogue: A Posterior Map of Massive

structures by clustering central haloes at $z = 0$ across the 80 posterior
realizations, selecting at most one member per realization. These
$\textit{associations}$ serve as probabilistic counterparts to individual
massive clusters, each with robust posterior estimates of mass, position, and

M_{200} \rangle > 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ persisting in at least 50\% of
realizations. We independently validate these systems through stacked
\textit{Planck} thermal Sunyaev--Zel'dovich measurements, which yield
significant detections ($>3\sigma$) with amplitudes following the expected
$Y$--$M$ relation. Many associations exhibit coherent evolutionary histories:
even with only $z = 0$ constraints, the inference narrows each system's
possible assembly pathway, localizing progenitor configurations to volumes 2--5
times smaller than mass-matched haloes in unconstrained $\Lambda$CDM
simulations. Cross-matches with X-ray catalogues reveal systematic mass-scale
differences that align with known observational biases:
\textsc{Manticore-Local} masses are typically twice ROSAT-based estimates but
agree at unity with weak-lensing-calibrated eROSITA measurements. This
demonstrates the catalogue's capability to diagnose systematics on an
object-by-object basis. The resulting catalogue provides an observationally
consistent map of massive structures in the local Universe, enabling direct
cross-probe comparisons, hybrid analyses combining simulated and observed
