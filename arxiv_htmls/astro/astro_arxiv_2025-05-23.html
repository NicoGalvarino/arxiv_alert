Healy</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables; Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The detailed study of gas flows in local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is
essential for understanding the regulation of star formation and black hole
growth, which are fundamental to galaxy evolution. One such AGN case study is
NGC 5643, a nearby ($D_{L}\sim17.3$ Mpc) star-forming, late-type, Seyfert
galaxy, where inflows and outflows have been observed in detail. NGC 5643 has
been studied at multiple wavelengths, however, a key missing component is
sensitive, high-resolution neutral hydrogen ($\mathrm{H\,I}$) observations. We
present 21-cm observations of NGC 5643 with MeerKAT, revealing six
low-$\mathrm{H\,I}$ mass ($M_{\text{$\mathrm{H\,I}$}}\sim10^{7} M_\odot$)
sources surrounding NGC 5643 and $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in IC 4444, $\sim230$ kpc
north of NGC 5643. In NGC 5643, $\mathrm{H\,I}$ extends beyond the stellar disk
with several morphological and kinematical asymmetries. North of the disk is an
extended 30 kpc tail with counter-rotating velocities. This is $\mathrm{H\,I}$
gas accreting onto the regularly rotating disk of NGC 5643 from the
environment. Within the spiral arms of the disk, we identify extraplanar gas
components, tracing galactic fountains driven by star formation regions. These
fountains have a molecular gas component and show an increased
$\mathrm{H}_2$/$\mathrm{H\,I}$ ratio. In the circum-nuclear region, we observe
spatially unresolved $\mathrm{H\,I}$ absorption that is slightly blue-shifted
($\sim72$ \kms) with an $\mathrm{H\,I}$ emission counterpart at redshifted
velocities. These MeerKAT observations provide a complete census of the
$\mathrm{H\,I}$ in and around this nearby Seyfert galaxy, providing missing
information on the cold gas flows fuelling the star formation and nuclear
activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16158v1" target="_blank"><h2>Confirming HSC strong lens candidates with DESI Spectroscopy. I. Project
  Overview</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yiping Shu, Shen Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, submitted to SCIENCE CHINA Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Accurate redshift determinations of both lenses and sources are critical for
confirming strong-lens systems and fully realizing their scientific value.
However, the thousands of strong-lens candidates now routinely discovered in
wide-field imaging surveys make one-by-one follow-up observations impractical.
In this work, we investigate the capability and efficiency of large-scale
spectroscopic surveys in confirming strong-lens systems. As a case study, we
cross-match strong lens candidates identified from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program with Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI). We find that DESI DR1 serendipitously observed putative
lenses and/or lensed images in approximately 50\% of these candidates.
Analyzing the DESI spectra for $\approx 500$ matched candidates that meet our
specific interests, we determine both lens and source redshifts for 27 systems.
Additionally, 76 candidate systems feature lensing galaxies at $z > 0.8$, and
one candidate system contains a quasar within its lensing galaxy. Applying this
approach to other strong-lens candidates will yield numerous additional
confirmations, with a further several-fold increase anticipated from the final
DESI data release. Our results highlight the growing importance of large-scale
spectroscopic surveys in advancing strong lensing discoveries and
investigations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16153v1" target="_blank"><h2>Model-Independent Measurement of the Matter-Radiation Equality Scale in

Zou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The peak of the matter power spectrum, known as the turnover (TO) scale, is
determined by the horizon size at the time of matter-radiation equality. This
scale can serve as a standard ruler, independent of other features in the
matter power spectrum, such as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Here, we
present the first detection of the turnover in the galaxy auto-power spectrum,
utilising the distribution of quasars (QSO) and luminous red galaxies (LRG)
measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) during its first
year of survey operations in a model-independent manner. To avoid confirmation
bias, we first analyse the data using data blinding methods designed for the
DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift space distortion and scale-dependent
bias signals. We measure the angle-averaged dilation distance $D_V(z = 1.651) =
(38.1\pm 2.5)r_H$ from the quasars and $D_{V}(z = 0.733) = (21.8\pm 1.0)r_H$
from the LRG sample in units of the horizon $r_H$ at the
matter-radiation-equality epoch. Combining these two constraints and assuming a
flat $\Lambda$CDM model with three standard neutrino species, we can translate
this into a constraint of $\Omega_{m}h^2 = 0.139^{+0.036}_{-0.046}$. We can
break the $\Omega_m$-$H_0$ degeneracy with low-redshift distance measurements
from type-Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon+, we obtain a sound-horizon free
estimate of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter of $H_0=65.2^{+4.9}_{-6.2}$
km/s/Mpc, consistent with sound-horizon dependent DESI measurements. On the
other hand, combining the DESI BAO and TO, we find a truly DESI-only
measurement of $H_0=74.0^{+7.2}_{-3.5}$ km/s/Mpc, in line with DESI-only
full-shape results where the sound-horizon scale is marginalised out. This
discrepancy in $H_0$ can be reconciled in a $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, where the
combination of DESI BAO and TO data yields $H_0 = 66.5\pm
7.2\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16509v1" target="_blank"><h2>Selection of Dwarf Galaxies Hosting AGNs: A Measure of Bias and
  Contamination using Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sogol Sanjaripour, Archana Aravindan, Gabriela Canalizo, Shoubaneh Hemmati, Bahram Mobasher, Alison L. Coil, Barry C. Barish</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies is critical for understanding black hole
formation but remains challenging due to their low luminosities, low
metallicities, and star formation-driven emission that can obscure AGN
signatures. Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly unsupervised
methods, offer new ways to address these challenges by uncovering patterns in
complex data. In this study, we apply Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to explore
the SED manifold of dwarf galaxies and evaluate AGN selection biases across
diagnostics. We train a 51 by 51 SOM on 30,344 dwarf galaxies (redshift less
than 0.055 and stellar mass below 10 to the 9.5 solar masses) from the NSA
catalog using nine-band photometry from near-UV to mid-infrared. A set of 438
previously identified dwarf AGNs, selected via various methods, was mapped onto
the SOM. AGNs identified by different methods occupy distinct and partially
overlapping regions in SED space, reflecting selection biases tied to host
properties. BPT selected AGNs cluster in higher-mass regions, while X-ray and
variability-selected AGNs show broader distributions. WISE-selected AGNs are
concentrated in lower-mass regions and form two clumps: one associated with
bluer, starburst-like systems and the other with redder, more AGN-like SEDs.
This separation may help distinguish true AGN hosts from starburst contaminants
in WISE-selected samples. AGNs selected via traditional emission-line,
broad-line, and WISE methods tend to avoid SOM regions linked to strong star
formation. In contrast, a subset of AGNs in low-mass galaxies occupy regions
indicative of high AGN luminosity relative to stellar content, highlighting
luminous AGNs in faint hosts. These results demonstrate the utility of manifold
learning for improving AGN selection in the low-mass regime.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16858v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-Parametric Attenuation Curves in Local Star-Forming Galaxies:
  Geometry Effect, Dust Evolution, and ISS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiafeng Lu, Xi Kang, Shiyin Shen, Qi Zeng, Shuai Feng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 7 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce a non-parametric approach, the Stellar Population Synthesis with
Equivalent Widths (SEW) method, to reconstruct spectral-resolution
wavelength-dependent attenuation curves for 169,568 star-forming galaxies from
the SDSS DR7. Composite attenuation curves, stacked across stellar mass and
inclination bins, reveal systematic trends: higher stellar mass correlates with
steeper attenuation slopes (lower $R_V$), while edge-on galaxies exhibit
flatter curves due to geometric saturation effects. Radiative transfer
modelling under a uniform dust-star mixture confirms that the observed slope
evolution with inclination comes from the galaxy geometry; the slope evolution
with stellar mass arises from intrinsic dust property variations, linked to
mass-dependent grain processing mechanisms. Additionally, intermediate-scale
structures (ISS) at 4870, 6370, and 7690 \r{A} are tentatively detected. These
findings underscore the interplay between dust geometry, grain evolution, and
galactic environment, offering new insights into dust lifecycle models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16075v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectroscopic study of globular and fuzzy clusters in Lenticular galaxy

Rosa-González</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 13 figures and 7 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We here report the results from spectroscopic observations of a sample of 26
globular cluster (GC) and 21 faint fuzzy (FF) candidates in the lenticular
galaxy NGC 1023 using the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Using the
recessional velocities and stellar absorption features, we determine that 18
and 9 of the observed candidates are bona fide GCs and FFs, respectively. The
majority of the rejected FF candidates are background emission line galaxies
for which we determine their redshifts. We used the spectroscopic data to
determine velocity, age, metallicity and extinction of all bona fide clusters.
We find that FFs are clearly younger (age = 7-9 Gyr) than GCs (age > 10 Gyr).
Both kind of clusters in this galaxy are metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -0.58 $\pm$
0.33). The ages and metallicities of individual FFs reported here are the first
such measurements in any galaxy and agree with the previously-reported
measurement on stacked spectrum. The kinematical analysis reaffirms that the
FFs belong to the disk of the galaxy, suggesting that their progenitors are
most likely massive, compact disk clusters that have been able to survive for
long timescales. We propose that the fuzzy appearance of FFs as compared to the
GCs is a consequence of the dynamical evolution of their progenitor super star
clusters in the disks of low-mass galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16528v1" target="_blank"><h2>Influence of Bar Formation on Star Formation Segregation and Stellar
  Migration: Implications for Variations in the Age Distribution of Milky Way
  Disk Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Junichi Baba</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted in PASJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a chemo-dynamical $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation of an isolated
Milky Way-like galaxy to investigate how bar formation influences star
formation rates, stellar migration, and the resulting age and metallicity
distributions of disk stars. Focusing on the transient epoch of bar formation,
a phase that triggers gas inflows, enhances local star formation, and drives
significant orbital migration, we find that the star formation rate in the
inner disk exhibits a pronounced peak during this period. This behavior arises
from the combined effect of vigorous star formation driven by strong spiral
arms prior to bar formation and the subsequent suppression of star formation
once the bar is established. In contrast, star formation in the outer disk
persists after bar formation at modest levels, and enhanced outward migration
of stars originally formed in the inner regions gives rise to a pronounced peak
in the outer disk's stellar age distribution corresponding to the bar formation
epoch. Moreover, stars formed during this epoch tend to exhibit higher
gas-phase metallicities, reflecting their origin in more metal-rich inner
regions. Although our model does not capture every detail of the Milky Way's
complex evolution, our results highlight the dominant role of bar driven
migration in segregating star formation activity and in shaping the long-term
chemical and age structure of the Galactic disk. Recent observational studies
suggest that the Milky Way's bar is approximately 8 Gyr old; therefore, our
findings imply that the age distribution of stars in the solar circle and outer
disk should show a corresponding peak around that age.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16884v1" target="_blank"><h2>Periodic Variability in Space Photometry of 181 New Supermassive Black
  Hole Binary Candidates</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pablo Huijse, Jordy Davelaar, Joris De Ridder, Nicholas Jannsen, Conny Aerts</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 4 figures, 2 appendices. Manuscript submitted to Journal on 25 April 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Robust detections of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are essential
to unravel the role of galaxy mergers in galaxy evolution and for identifying
potential sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. One of the most
commonly used observational signatures of SMBHBs is periodic variability in the
light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which may arise from accretion
rate modulation or relativistic Doppler boosting due to binary orbital motion.
However, intrinsic stochastic AGN variability can mimic such periodic signals,
complicating robust identification. We report the discovery of 181 new SMBHB
candidates from a sample of approximately 770,000 AGN observed by the Gaia
space observatory. Periodic signals were identified using a novel and
computationally efficient Bayesian model selection framework, enabling unbiased
source selection and quantifying the likelihood of periodicity over stochastic
variability. These candidates nearly double the known SMBHB population and
provide a prioritized target list for next-generation time-domain surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16006v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Peekaboo galaxy: new SALT spectroscopy and implications of archive
  HST data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alexei Kniazev, Simon Pustilnik</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to A&A Letters, 20 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The dwarf galaxy Peekaboo was recently identified as a Local Volume (LV)
gas-rich and 'eXtremely Metal-Poor' (XMP) dIrr. Its gas metallicity is
Z~Zsun/50, with +/-1$\sigma$ uncertainty range of [Zsun/72-Zsun/35]). Its the
"Tip of Red Giant Stars" (TRGB)-based distance is of 6.8$\pm$0.7 Mpc. HST data
for its individual stars reveal that its older RGB stars comprise a smaller
part, while the majority of visible stars have ages of less than one to a few
Gyr. Thus, Peekaboo dwarf can be considered as the nearest record-low-Z dwarf.
As such, the galaxy deserves a deeper multi-method study, including properties
of both, young massive stars and the fainter older population, and its ionised
gas and the dominant baryonic component of HI gas. We use the direct (Te)
method for the east HII region, in which the [OIII]4363A line is well detected,
to estimate its parameter 12+log(O/H). Since in the west HII region the line
[OIII]4363A is not detected, its O/H is estimated via the empirical
"strong-line" method. The resulting value of O/H is very close to that in the
east HII region. The new spectroscopy of Peekaboo dwarf allows us to improve
substantially the accuracy of its direct O/H estimate, which appears of
12+log(O/H) = 6.99$\pm$0.06. The new data reveal that emission lines in the E
region consist of two components with the velocity difference of ~65 km/s. The
fainter, approaching, component can be related to a fast-moving WR star thrown
from a cluster or a binary system. Using the HST $V$ magnitudes and colour
$V-I$, we identify tentative O-type and very hot candidate WO stars, which are
likely the ionising stars of the studied HII regions. With the new optical
spectra, the Peekaboo galaxy is confirmed as the lowest-metallicity dwarf in
the Local Volume and the valuable object for indeep multi-method studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16738v1" target="_blank"><h2>The S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP): Mapping H$α$+[NII] emission in 77

an ideal environment for studying environmental effects on galaxy evolution.
Utilizing data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS),
this study explores the H$\alpha$+[NII] emission maps across an area of
approximately 208 square degrees around NGC 1399. For such, a dedicated
semi-automated pipeline, Pixel-to-Pixel Emission Line Estimate (PELE), was
developed to generate emission line maps by processing S-PLUS images using the
Three Filter Method. A morphological analysis was conducted using the
ASTROMORPHLIB package to determine whether H$\alpha$+[NII] emitters exhibit
perturbed features. The study successfully detected 77 H$\alpha$+[NII] emitters
with $r<18$ mag, extending to four times the virial radius of the Fornax
cluster. PELE demonstrated its ability to recover flux down to 2e-17 erg
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ when compared to H$\alpha$ maps from MUSE/VLT. Among the
emitters, 25% are early-type galaxies (ETG) and 75% late-type galaxies (LTG).
Signs of morphological perturbation or merger activity are observed in 44% of
the LTG and in three ETG located beyond the cluster's virial radius. A
significant fraction (91%) of the emitters are identified as recent infallers,
primarily located in the northwestern region of the cluster, while others are
associated with the infalling group Fornax A in the southwest. Disturbed,
low-mass galaxies at larger cluster-centric distances provide evidence of
galaxies begin transforming before entering the main cluster. This study
demonstrates S-PLUS's effectiveness in detecting emitters, whose distribution
reflects the Fornax cluster's assembly history, with LTG linked to recent
infall from the field, possibly along a Fornax-Eridanus filament, and ETG may
have evolved prior to entry.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16731v1" target="_blank"><h2>High angular resolution near-ultraviolet polarization imaging of the

insights into the processes of stellar formation, early stellar evolution and
protoplanetary disks.Two of the key features of such stars are their
circumstellar dusty disk and bipolar ionized outflows, which are key components
for understanding planet formation processes and energy/matter deposition in
the interstellar medium, respectively. In this context, imaging polarimetry is
probably the sharpest tool to characterize the various structures and dynamics
around the central star, due to the sensitivity of polarization to the
morphology of the emitting, scattering and absorbing media. We take advantage
of never published, near-ultraviolet polarimetric data of LK-H{\alpha}-233
taken by the Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 1991,
1994 and 1995, which remained dormant in the archives despite their quality.
Using the most recent and robust reduction pipeline for this instrument, we
obtained high spatial resolution (0.0287 x 0.0287 arcsecond2) maps of this
object at 4118 {\AA}, together with polarimetric measurements. A dark lane,
bisecting the approaching and receding polar outflows, suggests the presence of
a circumstellar disk or dust torus, obscuring the pre-main sequence star and
collimating the ejecta. Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape
structure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle,
indicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from
the buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and
circumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the
obscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of
high-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex
environment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar
instruments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16005v1" target="_blank"><h2>Distance estimation of the high-velocity cloud Anti-Center Shell</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yu-Ting Wang, Chao Liu, Zhi-Yu Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 14 figures - Accepted for publication in RAA</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are interstellar gas clouds whose velocities are
incompatible with Galactic rotation. Since the first discovery of HVCs in 1963,
their origins have been debated for decades but are still not settled down,
because of the lack of vital parameters of HVCs, e.g., the distance. In this
work, we determined the distance to the high-velocity cloud, namely the
Anti-Center Shell (ACS). We trace the ACS with extinction derived from K-giant
stars with known distances and with the diffuse interstellar band (DIB) feature
at 5780 $\text{{\AA}}$ fitted on spectra of O- and B-type stars with distance.
As a result, we provide a lower limit distance of ACS as $\sim$8 kpc, which
extends the lower limit outward by approximately 4 kpc compared to previous
work. A byproduct of the DIB method is that we detected a bar-shaped structure
with a unusually high positive line-of-sight velocity. Its shape extends along
the (l,b)=(155,-5)$^{\circ}$ sight-line and shows a slightly increasing trend
in equivalent width and velocity as the distance increases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16420v1" target="_blank"><h2>Meta-Calibration of the Cosmic Magnification Coefficient: Toward

patterns of galaxies through cosmic magnification. This effect enables the
reconstruction of weak lensing convergence $\hat{\kappa}$ maps for DES and
DECaLS by linearly combining galaxy overdensities across magnitude bins in the
$g$, $r$, and $z$ photometry bands \citep{Qin+,Qin2+}. In this study, we
enhance the lensing reconstruction method by addressing biases in the
magnification coefficient estimation, which arise from incomplete consideration
of selection effects, especially those induced by photometric redshift
(photo-$z$) selection. Using a Random Forest-based photo-$z$ estimation for
DECaLS and DES galaxies, we quantify the impact of photo-$z$ induced selection
on magnification coefficient estimation. Our results show that neglecting
photo-$z$ selection introduces significant biases in the magnification
coefficient, leading to deviations in the reconstructed convergence map
amplitude $A$, with values ranging from 0.4 to 3.5 depending on the survey,
redshift, and magnitude cuts. By incorporating an improved magnification
coefficient estimation that accounts for photo-$z$ selection, these biases are
significantly reduced, with $A$ converging to $\sim 1$ as the magnitude cuts
approach optimal values. This improvement is consistently observed across DES
and DECaLS datasets and redshift bins, despite differences in survey strategies
and depths. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing photo-$z$
induced selection to achieve unbiased weak lensing reconstructions and accurate
cosmic magnification measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16255v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the chemical link between H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH within the

Eibensteiner</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 11 figures, accepted in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) have served as traditional
tracers of the star formation process for decades. Studies of the environments
which produce these species, though, have pointed to significant differences in
the physical environments within which each molecule resides. In this paper we
investigate the physical and chemical conditions which give rise to
formaldehyde and methanol emission in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We
employ high spatial (1.$''$6 or $\sim28$ pc) and spectral ($\sim10$ km/s)
imaging of the NGC 253 central molecular zone (CMZ) from the ALCHEMI Large
Program to constrain radiative transfer models of the dense gas volume density,
and temperature, molecular species column density, and source filling factor
within eight giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We also measure the relative
abundances of the two nuclear spin isomers of CH$_3$OH to investigate its
formation history. The physical and chemical conditions derived clearly
indicate that H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH originate from distinct physical
environments. H$_2$CO traces low volume density and high kinetic temperatures,
while CH$_3$OH traces high volume density and low kinetic temperatures. The
H$_2$CO abundances are constant, though poorly constrained, within the eight
NGC 253 GMCs analyzed, while the CH$_3$OH abundance shows a radial gradient
from low to high values within the NGC 253 CMZ. Our findings highlight the
complex chemical and physical differentiation of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO in the
starburst environment of NGC 253. Methanol formation appears to be influenced
by warm, dynamic processes rather than cold cloud chemistry, while formaldehyde
primarily forms via gas-phase reactions. These results challenge the assumption
of a direct chemical link between CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO and underscores the
impact of starburst-driven shocks, turbulence, and cosmic rays on molecular gas

Shankaranarayanan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 5 figures. Dedicated to the memory of Prof. Jayant V. Narlikar</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of a spatially flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with pressureless dust
(modeled via the Brown-Kucha\v{r} formalism) and a dynamical cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ treated in the unimodular gravity framework, where
unimodular time serves as a relational clock. Remarkably, the quantum dynamics
of this system exhibit a mathematical correspondence to a non-relativistic
hydrogen atom -- $\Lambda$ maps to energy eigenvalues, the volume variable to
the radial coordinate, and the dust energy density parameter to the Coulomb
potential strength. This analogy yields a continuous spectrum for positive
$\Lambda$, analogous to scattering states. For $\Lambda > 0$, we prove the
self-adjointness of the unimodular Hamiltonian, guaranteeing unitary evolution
in unimodular time. By constructing wave packets from normalized stationary
states, we demonstrate a quantum bounce that resolves the classical Big Bang
singularity. The dynamics transition from semiclassical behavior far from the
bounce to quantum-dominated regions featuring characteristic "ringing"
oscillations due to interference near the bounce. We quantify quantum effects
through expectation values and fluctuations of cosmological observables,
finding evidence for persistent quantum effects in the late universe. Thus our
results suggest that quantum gravitational effects may leave imprints on
late-time cosmology, even beyond the bounce.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16767v1" target="_blank"><h2>One-loop kernels in scale-dependent Horndeski theory</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ziyang Zheng, Hanqiong Jia, Bilal Tüdes, Anton Chudaykin, Martin Kunz, Luca Amendola</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 2 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the nonlinear evolution of cosmological perturbations in
theories with scale-dependent perturbation growth, first in general and then
focusing on Horndeski gravity. Within the framework of standard perturbation
theory, we derive the second- and third-order kernels and show that they are
fully determined by two effective functions, $h_1$ and $h_c$, which parametrize
deviations from general relativity. Using the Wronskian method, we obtain
solutions for the nonlinear growth functions and present explicit expressions
for the resulting kernels, including bias and redshift space distortions. We
show that the kernels are entirely dependent on the linear growing mode: once
this is calculated, the kernels are analytic up to a time integral. Our
approach provides a physically motivated framework for evaluating the one-loop
galaxy power spectrum in scale-dependent theories, suitable for the forecasts
and actual data analysis.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16853v1" target="_blank"><h2>Power law $α$-Starobinsky inflation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Saisandri Saini, Akhilesh Nautiyal</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 2 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained
by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation
($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law
Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential.
After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically,
we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter
$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during
inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We
find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta =
1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$
and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed
model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and
Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we
calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the
CMB and LSS observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16820v1" target="_blank"><h2>The isotropy, anisotropies and non-Gaussianity of the scalar-induced
  gravitational-wave background: diagrammatic approach for primordial
  non-Gaussianity up to any order</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jun-Peng Li, Sai Wang, Zhi-Chao Zhao, Kazunori Kohri</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 106 pages, 33 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) produced nonlinearly by the
enhanced cosmological curvature perturbations can serve as a potentially
powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in the early Universe. In
this work, we comprehensively investigate the imprints of local-type PNG on the
SIGW background beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations. We
develop a diagrammatic approach capable of analyzing SIGWs for PNG up to any
order. Utilizing this approach, we derive semi-analytic formulas for the
energy-density fraction spectrum of the isotropic background, the angular power
spectrum of the energy-density anisotropies, as well as the angular bispectrum
and trispectrum of the energy-density non-Gaussianity. Specializing to PNG up
to quartic approximation (parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, $g_\mathrm{NL}$,
and $h_\mathrm{NL}$), we numerically compute all contributions to these SIGW
spectra. We find that PNG can significantly alter the amplitude of the
energy-density spectrum and generate substantial anisotropies through the
initial inhomogeneities. Furthermore, we observe that the angular bispectrum
and trispectrum always vanish when the primordial curvature perturbations are
Gaussian; otherwise, they do not, indicating their potential utility as probes
of PNG. Therefore, we anticipate that both the isotropic background and the
anisotropies of the SIGW background will provide essential information about
the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16553v1" target="_blank"><h2>Denoising Milky Way stellar survey data with normalizing flow models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ziyang Yan, Jason L. Sanders</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted by MNRAS, 16 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Gaia dataset has revealed many intricate Milky Way substructures in
exquisite detail, including moving groups and the phase spiral. Precise
characterisation of these features and detailed comparisons to theoretical
models require engaging with Gaia's heteroscedastic noise model, particularly
in more distant parts of the Galactic disc and halo. We propose a general,
novel machine-learning approach using normalizing flows for denoising density
estimation, with particular focus on density estimation from stellar survey
data such as that from Gaia. Normalizing flows transform a simple base
distribution into a complex target distribution through bijective
transformations resulting in a highly expressive and flexible model. The
denoising is performed using importance sampling. We demonstrate that this
general procedure works excellently on Gaia data by reconstructing detailed
local velocity distributions artificially corrupted with noise. For example, we
show the multiple branches of the Hercules stream and the phase-space spiral
can both be well captured by our model. We discuss hyperparameter choice to
optimally recover substructure and compare our approach to extreme
deconvolution. The model therefore promises to be a robust tool for studying
the Milky Way's kinematics in Galactic locations where the noise from Gaia is
significant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16317v1" target="_blank"><h2>Early Stellar Flybys are Unlikely: Improved Constraints from Sednoids
  and Large-$q$ TNOs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Qingru Hu, Yukun Huang, Brett Gladman, Wei Zhu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Sedna-like objects (a.k.a. sednoids) are transneptunian objects (TNOs)
characterized by large semimajor axes and exceptionally high perihelia. Their
high-$q$ orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and
need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar
flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk,
generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations
with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close
stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached
extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($i<30^\circ$) profile
and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field
stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the
birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the
inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either
coplanar ($i_\star \sim 0^\circ$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane
($\omega_\star \sim 0^\circ, i_\star \sim 90^\circ$). After taking into account
their occurrence rate at the early stage of the Solar System, we conclude that
close-in stellar flybys ($q_\star \le 1000$~au) that satisfy all constraints
are unlikely to happen ($\lesssim$5\%). Future discoveries of additional
sednoids with precise orbital determinations are crucial to confirm the
existence of the low-inclination tendency and the primordial alignment, and to
further constrain the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System.</p></br></body>
