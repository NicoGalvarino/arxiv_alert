cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for
radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent
diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive
black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase
interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen
and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free
electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical
network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two
grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a
subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN
feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars,
dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and
baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the
observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black
hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions,
with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in
cubic volumes of up to 50, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The two
largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the
model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual
impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift
galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and
excellent agreement with the data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21812v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inferring local quasar IGM damping wing constraints</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Timo Kist, Joseph F.

the neutral hydrogen (HI) content in the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM),
not only constraining the global timing of reionization but also the
\textit{local} ionization topology near the quasar. Near-optimal extraction of
this information is possible with the help of two recently introduced
reionization model-independent summary statistics of the HI distribution in the
IGM \textit{before} the quasar started shining, complemented with the quasar's
lifetime encoding the effect of its ionizing radiation as a third parameter. We
introduce a fully Bayesian JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference
framework that allows us to jointly reconstruct the quasar's unknown continuum
and constrain these local damping wing statistics. We put forward a
probabilistic framework that allows us to tie these local constraints to any
specific reionization model and obtain model-dependent constraints on the
global timing of reionization. We demonstrate that we are able to constrain the
(Lorentzian-weighted) HI column density in front of the quasar to a precision
of $0.69_{-0.30}^{+0.06}\,\mathrm{dex}$ and its original distance to the first
neutral patch before the quasar started shining to
$31.4_{-28.1}^{+10.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc}$ (if a noticeable damping wing is present
in the spectrum), extracting hitherto unused local information from the IGM
damping wing imprint. Once tied to a specific reionization model, we find that
the statistical fidelity of our constraints on the global IGM neutral fraction
and the lifetime of the quasar improves, while retaining the same precision as
achieved by pipelines that infer these parameters directly.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21818v1" target="_blank"><h2>First constraints on the local ionization topology in front of two

signature also carries \textit{local} information about the distribution of
neutral hydrogen (HI) in front of the quasar before it started shining.
Leveraging a recently introduced Bayesian \texttt{JAX}-based Hamiltonian Monte

$t_\mathrm{Q}$ based on JWST/NIRSpec spectra of the two $z \sim 7.5$ quasars
J1007+2115 and J1342+0928. After folding in model-dependent topology

in a $\langle x_\mathrm{HI} \rangle = 0.32_{-0.20}^{+0.22}$
($0.58_{-0.23}^{+0.23}$) neutral IGM while shining for a remarkably short
lifetime of $\log_{10} t_\mathrm{Q} /\mathrm{yr} = 4.14_{-0.18}^{+0.74}$ (an
intermediate lifetime of $5.64_{-0.43}^{+0.25}$) along a sightline with
$\log_{10} N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW} /\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 19.70_{-0.86}^{+0.35}$

potential presence of local absorbers in the foreground of J1342+0928 as has
been recently suggested, we also demonstrate how the Lorentzian-weighted column

their contribution to the observed damping wing signal.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21152v1" target="_blank"><h2>How does feedback affect the star formation histories of galaxies?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kartheik G.

processes that shape the multiphase gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic
media. Using the CAMELS suite of cosmological simulations, we study the effects
of varying feedback and cosmology on the average star formation histories
(SFHs) of galaxies at $z\sim0$ across the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and ASTRID galaxy
formation models. We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to
changes in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and
the rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN
feedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding,
accretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple
stellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for
the central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the
average SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the
SFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all
three models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different
coefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with
cosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and
feedback and baryon cycling at late times. Galaxy SFHs provide a novel,
complementary probe to constrain cosmology and feedback, and can connect the
observational constraints from current and upcoming galaxy surveys with the
physical mechanisms responsible for regulating galaxy growth and quenching.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21282v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGN jet evolution simulation with GADGET4-OSAKA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chenze Dong, Abednego Wiliardy, Kentaro Nagamine, Yuri Oku, Boon Kiat Oh, Renyue Cen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 15 figures, 1 table.

depositing energy and momentum into the circumgalactic and intracluster medium
(CGM/ICM) and regulating gas cooling and star formation. We investigate the
dynamics of jet evolution in the self-similar regime using the smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Gadget4-Osaka, systematically varying jet
launching schemes, artificial viscosity prescriptions, mass resolution, and jet
lifetimes. Our analysis combines quantitative diagnostics of jet size and
energetics with detailed morphological and thermodynamic characterizations from
slice maps and phase diagrams. We find that jet lobe growth follows analytic
self-similar scaling relations and converges with resolution, but is highly
sensitive to the choice of artificial viscosity. While the overall jet size
tracks self-similar predictions, the partitioning of thermal and kinetic energy
departs significantly from the idealized picture, reflecting enhanced
dissipation and mixing. These results establish robust benchmarks for SPH-based
jet modeling, provide insight into the physical and numerical factors shaping
jet--medium interactions, and lay the groundwork for future studies of AGN
feedback in realistic galactic and cluster environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21356v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Bigfoot: A footprint of a Coma cluster progenitor at z=3.98</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hanwen Sun, Tao Wang, Emanuele Daddi, Qiaoyang Hao, Ke Xu, David Elbaz, Luwenjia Zhou, Houjun Mo, Huiyuan Wang, Longyue Chen, Yangyao Chen, Shuowen Jin, Yipeng Lyu, Nikolaj Sillassen, Kai Wang, Tiancheng Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, submitted to ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), high redshift (abstract), IGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to
understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member
galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of
Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent
galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants.
Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at $z =
3.98$ including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric)
redshifts with JWST, extending over $15\times 37$ $\times 49{\rm{cMpc^3}}$ in
the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member
galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors
of today's most massive clusters (${M_0} > 10^{15} {M_{_ \odot }}$). All
subgroups with ${M_{\rm{h}}} > {10^{12.5}}{M_{_ \odot }}$ exhibit enhanced
fractions of massive galaxies ($>{10^{10.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) compared to
lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of
massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster
with a large central halo (${10^{13.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) in a JWST deep field
bears important cosmological implication that favors high ${\sigma _8}$ of
PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21591v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio emission from absorption-line quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sina Chen, Ehud Behar, Ari Laor, Nahum Arav</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), AGN (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Absorption Line Quasars (ALQs) generally exhibit significant outflows that
may interact with the surrounding medium, resulting in radio emission. We
selected a sample of 13 powerful radio-quiet (RQ) ALQs, where the UV outflow
kinetic power is measurable, and detected nine of them with the Very Large
Array at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz. The radio emission is mostly unresolved,
indicating no emission beyond a spatial scale of ~ 1-3 kpc. In the nine
detected objects, the radio spectral slope at 5.5-9.0 GHz is steep (< -0.5) in
five objects and is flat or inverted (> -0.5) in four objects. We discuss how
the steep-slope emission can be associated with the UV outflows, and how the
flat-slope emission can be intrinsically steep but flattened by free-free
absorption from the UV outflowing gas. However, we find no correlation between
the radio luminosity and the estimated outflow kinetic power, which suggests
that the outflows are not a major source of the observed radio emission. In
addition, the radio loudness of these RQ ALQs is comparable to that of typical
RQ quasars, implying that the UV outflows do not lead to excess radio emission.
Follow-up radio observations can test the free-free absorption interpretation
and can be used as a new probe for outflows in AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21114v1" target="_blank"><h2>Super-Eddington accretion in protogalactic cores</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tommaso Zana, Pedro R.

already at redshift $z > 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth.
Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve
this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical
experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth
of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$,
using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a
slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying
the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion
enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm
M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties.
Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH
dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the
strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the
Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local
gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical
setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are
over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with
JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent
a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic
times, even starting from light seeds.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21681v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hyper Suprime-Cam Y3 results: photo-$z$ bias calibration with lensing

distributions for source galaxies in the HSC-Y3 weak lensing survey using
small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing. By measuring the tangential shear around
spectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen
narrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean
redshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on
the photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving
signal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for
$\Delta z_2$, $\Delta z_3$ and $\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from
HSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\Delta
z_3$-$\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample,
which disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio
measurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on
cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.286_{-0.074}^{+0.038}$ and $S_8 =
0.760_{-0.145}^{+0.044}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results. This work
demonstrates the utility of small-scale lensing as an independent probe for

distribution within a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy simulation on global
attenuation curves, focusing on the optical-UV slope and the 2175 $AA$ bump. We
discuss the contributions of star-dust geometry, scattering, and dust
properties. Post-processing dust radiative transfer was performed using SKIRT
based on the MW-like galaxy simulation. The simulation was carried out with
GADGET4-OSAKA, which models the evolution of grain size distributions.
  For lower inclination angles (closer to face-on), the attenuation curve
flattens over time up to t=1 Gyr, then becomes progressively steeper. This
steeper slope arises from the interplay between scattering and the dust disk
becoming more extended over time (changes in star-dust geometry). At higher
inclination, scattering is suppressed, and the attenuation curves slightly
steepen over time due to small-grain formation and the bias of observed UV
light toward older stars. The bump strengthens on a timescale of ~250 Myr due
to the formation of small carbonaceous grains. The bump strength is affected
not only by the abundance of small grains but also by star-dust geometry. At
higher $A_V$ or higher inclination, the bump weakens. These results may help
interpret flatter attenuation curves and weaker bumps in high-redshift
galaxies. Variations in star-dust geometry alter the amount of scattered
photons escaping the galaxy, driving the anti-correlation between the slope and
$A_V$. Scatter in this relation arises from differences in dust optical depth
along and perpendicular to the line of sight, reflecting inclination and
star-dust geometry. Additional contributions come from variations in grain size
distribution and the fraction of obscured young stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21401v1" target="_blank"><h2>Global Hot Gas Excess in (U)LIRGs: Replicating Galactic Nuclei Scaling

feedback processes, redistributing energy, momentum, and material throughout
galaxies. We use X-ray data from $Chandra$ to extract the hot gas emission from
78 of the most luminous infrared-selected galaxies in the local Universe. In
the extreme star-forming environments, the intrinsic thermal X-ray luminosity
of hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) shows a significant excess over
the predictions of the standard linear $L_{\rm X}$$-$SFR relation for most
objects with very high star formation rates (SFRs). The contribution of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to have little impact on the global hot gas
luminosity. For galaxies with SFR $\gt$ 50 ${M_{\rm \odot}}\,\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$,
the Bayesian analysis gives a super-linear relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm
0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm
\odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+39.82$, similar to that found in the central regions of
normal spiral galaxies. These results suggest a scenario in which the merger of
galaxies delivers substantial amounts of gas, triggering intense star formation
in both the nuclear region and the galactic disk, and ultimately enhancing the
global thermal X-ray emission. The ratio of the apparent thermal luminosity in
the 0.5$-$2 keV band ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$) to $L_{\rm 0.5 -
2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ shows statistically significant negative correlations with
the intrinsic column density ($N_{\rm H}$) and SFR. Moreover, in contrast to
the luminosity ratio, SFR shows a moderate positive correlation with intrinsic
$N_{\rm H}$. This suggests that the correlation between $L_{\rm 0.5 -
2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$/$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ and SFR may be driven by
the underlying $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm appar}$/$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm

this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution
simulations based on the {\it SMUGGLE} framework, and compare the results with
X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for
subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback
(including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the
total $0.5-2$\,keV luminosity is consistent {\it within uncertainties} with
X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external
disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile
that declines too steeply beyond $\sim5$\,kpc, underpredicting the extended
emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid
prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below
MW observations by at least $1-2$ orders of magnitude, with the most severe
discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i)
stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central
$\sim5$\,kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the
resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational
heating, AGN feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary
to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies;
(iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from
those of the warm ($\sim10^5$\,K) gas, by combining our previous finding that

dark photon portal to the Standard Model in order to establish thermal
equilibrium in the early Universe, and discuss the ensuing phenomenological
constraints, including the stability of DM. The resulting dynamics accounts for
the observed DM relic abundance and yields velocity-dependent DM
self-interactions in astrophysical halos. Due to the sharp velocity dependence
arising from a Breit-Wigner resonance, dedicated studies are required to assess
the gravothermal evolution in detail, especially in the core-collapse regime.
This is particularly timely in light of self-interacting DM interpretations of
strong-lensing systems such as SDSS J0946+1006, which can be naturally
explained within our framework.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20386v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting the Radial Metallicity Gradient-Age Relation in the Milky

indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that
this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's
(MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across
all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR)
in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from
LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show
a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient
$\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the
thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient
spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM)
metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive
gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by
strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich
proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for
the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future
models of Galactic chemical evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20355v1" target="_blank"><h2>High sensitivity molecular line observations towards the L1544

the pre-stellar core L1544 are challenging the current physical and chemical
models. With the aim of further constraining the structure of L1544 as well as
assessing the completeness of chemical networks, we turn to radiative transfer
modelling of observed molecular lines towards this source. We obtained
high-sensitivity and high-spectral resolution observations of HCO+ (J = 1 - 0),
CS (J = 2 - 1), C34S (J = 2 - 1), H2CO (J ,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,1,1), c-C3H2
(J,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,0,1), SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) and 34SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) with
the IRAM 30m telescope towards the dust peak of L1544. A non-Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer code is coupled to the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method to model the observations. We find that with just one
transition for each isotope, the modelling cannot find a global minimum that
fits the observations. The derived fractional abundance profiles are compared
to those computed with chemical models. The observed transitions trace gas
components with distinct dynamics at different distances along the radius of
the core. Moreover, the results evidence a poor reproduction of sulphur
chemistry by chemical modelling and stresses the need to include a more
consistent S-depletion process to accurately reproduce the S-chemistry towards
dense cores.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21678v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating Little Red Dots with UV Excess: Are They the High-Redshift

unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual "V-shaped"
rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of
hyper-luminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called Blue-excess
Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to
those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at
redshifts z \sim 1--4. In this study, we compare their multi-wavelength SEDs to
investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs
of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar "V-shape" SEDs, LRDs
appear to be a different population than BHDs. The "V-shape" of BHDs appear at
longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies,
suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer
colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the
absence of hot dust heated by AGN accretion activities. We also argue that the
blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact
morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct
formation pathway from BHDs -- which are thought to be powered by
super-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21748v1" target="_blank"><h2>A direct black hole mass measurement in a Little Red Dot at the Epoch of

frontier have revealed a plethora of broad \Halpha emitters with optically red
continua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs), which comprise 15-30\% of the high
redshift broad line AGN population. Due to their peculiar spectral properties
and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven
challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates
in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into
question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to
2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely
stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a
strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep
spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear
star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point
mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from
the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar
component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\rm BH}/M_{*}>2$.
Such a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment,
indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest
accretion phase.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20769v1" target="_blank"><h2>Solar peculiar motion inferred from dipole anisotropy in redshift

- extremely large and dense structures tracing the dark matter with a higher
bias than isolated galaxies. We propose to use the tSZ data to separate
galaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to
different densities and biases independently of the redshift survey
systematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in
density-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the
constraints on cosmological parameters, like $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and
neutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to
demonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We
discover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs
corresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ
Compton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find
that such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity)
dispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample
and near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are
intrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic
effects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with
tSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern
remains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model
in our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from
tSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that
valuable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise
regions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the
individual cluster candidates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21461v1" target="_blank"><h2>Color dichotomy and gradients in the bulges and disks of EFIGI galaxies

is the significance of galaxy morphology? What physical processes underlier the
morphologies we observe and is a galaxy's internal structure driving its
evolution (nature) or is it a sign of the external processes which drive galaxy
evolution (nurture)? We aim to understand the color dichotomy and gradients in
bulges and disks along the Hubble sequence. We fit S\'ersic functions to the 2D
light distributions in the $g$, $r$, $i$ bands to bulges and disks of the large
EFIGI sample of galaxies with high quality morphological classification. In
early-type galaxies, bulges and disks have similarly red and nearly uniform
colors. Disks become significantly bluer with increasing lateness of their
types and bulges get slightly redder because of patchy dust. Disks have
increasingly blue colors with increasing radius, whereas dust extinction and
scattering leads to smaller effective radii of the bulges and lower steepness
of the best-fit S\'ersic profiles in $g$ versus $i$. The impact is not uniform
with Hubble type and the bulges of intermediate-type spirals (Sb-Sc) have the
reddest mean colors, the largest scatter in their colors, and show the largest
mean and scatter in their color gradients. Disks of the intermediate-type
galaxies show the strongest color gradients. We interpret these properties of
the bulges and disks of intermediate-type spirals as being due to dust
extinction and scattering which we hypothesize to be an indicator of the gas
content and inflow of gas. if early-type galaxies do evolve from massive spiral
galaxies, typically intermediate-type spirals, these color gradients are signs
of in-situ stellar growth within their bulges, likely driven by morphological
structure in their disk. These results favor secular evolution (nature) as the
primary driver of galaxy evolution in the local Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21069v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rapid late-time reionization: constraints and cosmological implications</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Willem Elbers</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present constraints on the reionization optical depth, $\tau$, obtained
using several independent methods. First, we perform a non-parametric
reconstruction of the reionization history, using Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints on
the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction,
$x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, including recent results from the James Webb Space
Telescope. When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements
from DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid
reionization history ($z_\mathrm{mid}=7.00^{+0.12}_{-0.18}$ and $\Delta
z_{50}=1.12^{+0.12}_{-0.29}$) and a value of $\tau=0.0492^{+0.0014}_{-0.0030}$,
which is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent
of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be
measured from large-scale $(\ell<30)$ CMB polarization data, yielding
constraints that are similarly model-insensitive and consistent with the
Ly$\alpha$ bound. Third, $\tau$ may be constrained from the attenuation of
small-scale $(\ell>30)$ CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the
choice of cosmological model. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM and combining small-scale
CMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints
that are compatible with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. Adding galaxy clustering and
lensing measurements brings the constraints further into agreement with the
Ly$\alpha$ bound. These independent results reinforce a consensus picture in
which reionization is rapid and late. However, the combination of small-scale
CMB, CMB lensing, and BAO data yields $\tau=0.094\pm0.011$, which is in
$4\sigma$ tension with our Ly$\alpha$ bound. Non-standard reionization
scenarios can reconcile some but not all constraints. Concordance is restored
in alternative cosmological models, such as models with dynamical dark energy
favoured by BAO, CMB, and SNe data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21708v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Spectroscopic Insights Into the Diversity of Galaxies in the First

a sample of 40 sources at z>10 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, the
largest of its kind thus far. We compare the properties of strong UV line
emitters, as traced by intense CIV emission, with those of more "typical"
sources with weak or undetected CIV. The more typical (or "CIV-weak") sources
reveal significant scatter in their CIII] line strengths, UV continuum slopes,
and physical sizes, spanning CIII] equivalent widths of ~1-51 \r{A}, UV slopes
of $\beta$~-1.6 to -2.6, and half-light radii of ~50-1000 pc. In contrast,
CIV-strong sources generally occupy the tail of these distributions, with CIII]
EWs of 16-51 \r{A}, UV slopes $\beta$<-2.5, compact morphologies ($r_{50}$<100
pc), and elevated star formation surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR}$>100
$M_{\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$). Collectively these properties are consistent with
concentrated starbursts that temporarily outshine the extended structure of the
galaxy. Comparing average properties from composite spectra, we find the
diversity of the sample is primarily driven by bursts and lulls of star
formation on very short timescales (<3 Myr), where strong CIV emitters are
observed at the apex of these phases and sources devoid of emission lines
represent periods of relative inactivity. An apparent association between
strong CIV and enhanced nitrogen abundance suggests both features may be
modulated by the same duty cycle and reflect a generic mode of star formation.
We show that AGN are unlikely to be a significant contributor to this duty
cycle based on a comparison of UV line diagnostics to photoionisation models,
although some non-thermal activity cannot be fully ruled out. Our results
support a unified evolutionary picture whereby transient bursts and lulls can
explain the spectral diversity and early growth of bright galaxies in the first
500 Myr.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21507v1" target="_blank"><h2>Merger fraction in galaxy groups and clusters at z < 0.2: A

new non-parametric classification scheme that combines the Gini-$M_{20}$
statistics with the shape asymmetry parameter, enabling robust identification
of mergers with both central concentration and outer morphological

find that the merger fraction increases with redshift for all subsamples (field
galaxies, galaxy pairs, and cluster members), and also shows a strong radial
gradient within clusters, increasing toward the center. These trends suggest
that merger activity is enhanced both at earlier cosmic times and in denser
environments, particularly in galaxy groups. We also find tentative evidence
that mergers may contribute to AGN triggering in cluster cores. Our study

present linear-order solutions for both total and relative perturbations in the
two-fluid system, identifying novel contributions to galaxy bias caused by the
relative density and velocity modes between the components. Incorporating these
effects into the galaxy bias expansion, we compute the linear galaxy power
spectrum in both real and redshift space. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we
assess the sensitivity of upcoming surveys such as DESI and PFS to MDM

lead to significant biases in inferred constraints on the warm dark matter

images in the $H_{\rm E}$, $J_{\rm E}$, $Y_{\rm E}$, and $I_{\rm E}$
photometric bands based on panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope observations.
The software was used to create a simulated database of Euclid images for the
27 galaxy clusters observed during the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey
with Hubble (CLASH) and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. Since the
mock images were generated from real observations, they incorporate, by
construction, all the complexity of the observed galaxy clusters. The simulated
Euclid data of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1$-$2403 were then used to explore
the possibility of developing strong lensing models based on the Euclid data.
In this context, complementary photometric or spectroscopic follow-up campaigns
are required to measure the redshifts of multiple images and cluster member
galaxies. By Euclidising six parallel blank fields obtained during the HFF
program, we provide an estimate of the number of galaxies detectable in Euclid
images per ${\rm deg}^2$ per magnitude bin (number counts) and the distribution
of the galaxy sizes. Finally, we present a preview of the Chandra Deep Field
South that will be observed during the Euclid Deep Survey and two examples of
galaxy-scale strong lensing systems residing in regions of the sky covered by
the Euclid Wide Survey. The methodology developed in this work lends itself to
several additional applications, as simulated Euclid fields based on HST (or
JWST) imaging with extensive spectroscopic information can be used to validate
the feasibility of legacy science cases or to train deep learning techniques in
advance, thus preparing for a timely exploitation of the Euclid Survey data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21182v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shengyu He, Jiaxi Yu, Antoine Rocher, Daniel Forero-Sánchez, Jean-Paul Kneib, Cheng Zhao, Etienne Burtin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 10 figures, submitted to JCAP</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), Euclid (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and
catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift
surveys at sub-percent level. We investigate their impact on full-shape
clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift
uncertainty introduces a damping effect on the power spectrum. This damping is
scale-dependent and absorbed by counterterms in the clustering model, keeping
parameter biases below $5\%$ for the DESI survey. Catastrophic failures reduce
the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor scaling with
contamination rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for the DESI ELG
populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift
uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in
cosmological constraints. For this case, shifts from $6\%$ to $16\%$
($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) arise in estimating the fractional growth rate
$df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10}
A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum
mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new
degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting
successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss in constraint. Our
results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid},
an accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model
are essential to get unbiased cosmological constraints. Extending to evolving
dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, we find that redshift errors do
not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but lead
to slightly weaker constraints on $\sum m_\nu$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21494v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Local Volume galaxy census and HST SNAP surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  I.

  Perturbation Theory: Fast Computation and Comparison with Emulators</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Naonori Sugiyama</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 14 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a fast and accurate formulation for computing the nonlinear matter
power spectrum at one-loop order based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation
Theory (ULPT). ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation,
capturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor,
accounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural
separation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term
and a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by
construction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and
FAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The
results are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark
Emulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees
with emulator predictions at the 2--3\% level up to \( k \simeq
0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \) for \( z \geq 0.5 \), without any nuisance
parameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the
two-point correlation function remains accurate down to \( r \simeq
10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc} \). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which
fails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT
maintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify
the mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak
sharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO
features seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and
computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in
galaxy surveys. The numerical implementation developed in this work is publicly
released as the open-source Python package \texttt{ulptkit}

cosmo_learn provides a standardized and flexible framework for benchmarking

the simulated data with the input cosmology via residuals and parameter

include traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, as well as more recent approaches
such as genetic algorithms, Gaussian processes, Bayesian ridge regression, and

probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers,
Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar
X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The

determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian
evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark

variations in their emitted radiation, providing a distinctive signature for
their identification. In this work, we explore the MBHBs identification via
optical variability studies by simulating the observations of the LSST survey.
To this end, we generate a population of MBHBs using the L-Galaxies
semi-analytical model, focusing on systems with observed orbital periods $\leq$
5 years. This ensures that at least two complete cycles of emission can be
observed within the 10-year mission of LSST. To construct mock optical light
curves, we first calculate the MBHB average magnitudes in each LSST filter by
constructing a self-consistent SED that accounts for the binary accretion
history and the emission from a circumbinary disc and mini-discs. We then add
variability modulations by using six 3D hydrodynamic simulations of accreting
MBHBs with different eccentricities and mass ratios as templates. To make the
light curves realistic, we mimic the LSST observation patterns and cadence, and
we include stochastic variability and LSST photometric errors. Our results show
from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$ MBHBs per square degree, with light curves that are
potentially detectable by LSST. These systems are mainly low-redshift
($z\lesssim1.5$), massive ($\gtrsim10^{7}\, M_{\odot}$), equal-mass (${\sim}
0.8$), relatively eccentric (${\sim}0.6$), and with modulation periods of
around $3.5$ years. Using periodogram analysis, we find that LSST variability
studies have a higher success rate ($>$50%) for systems with high
eccentricities ($e>$0.6). Additionally, at fixed eccentricity, detections tend
to favour systems with more unequal mass ratios. The false alarm probability
shows similar trends. Circular binaries systematically feature high values
($\gtrsim 10^{-1}$). Eccentric systems have low-FAP tails, down to
$\sim10^{-8}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21054v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on Logarithmic Model Extensions of Symmetric Teleparallel

framework both in background and perturbation such as cosmic expansion,
gravitational coupling constant, gravitational waves propagation. Focusing on
logarithmic extensions of $f(Q)$ models, we performed Bayesian analysis using
the most-recent cosmological data, DESI DR2, Pantheon+. We also utilized a
compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \sigma_8$) dataset to constrain
the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective
gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are
well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the
late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is
also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late
times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report
explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\mu$), and
the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\nu$) solely based on
the background data, which can be tested against future observations. While the
two Log-based extensions we have introduced here perform equivalently on the
background level, they provide contrasting predictions for the evolution of
effective Gravitational constant and propagation of gravitational waves, which
should be constrained against the future perturbation data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20644v1" target="_blank"><h2>Challenging $Λ$CDM with Higher-Order GUP Corrections</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andronikos Paliathanasis, Genly Leon, Yoelsy Leyva, Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano, Amare Abebe</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 2 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a
minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a
higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This
generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified
Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model
that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the
deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario,
analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism
for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ
Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2
release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our
analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive
with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to
some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation
parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative,
which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy

routinely constrained from observations. The forward modelling of observations,
in particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological
simulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to
account for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes,
the non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when
observables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us
from high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run
cosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent
boundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved
spacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free
expansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework,
allowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved
patch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good
approximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and
post-processing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20402v1" target="_blank"><h2>Post-Reheating Inflaton Production as a Probe of Reheating Dynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kunio Kaneta, Tomo Takahashi, Natsumi Watanabe</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 2 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmological reheating bridges the inflationary epoch and the hot big bang

renormalizable couplings. We show that inflaton quanta can be regenerated from
the thermal bath even after the decay of the coherent inflaton field, unveiling
a previously overlooked channel for inflaton particle production, which offers
a novel window into probing reheating. Remarkably, this mechanism may also
account for the observed dark matter abundance, providing a natural link

background using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from O1 through O4a, the
first part of the fourth observing run. This background is the accumulated
signal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes
information about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the
Universe, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from
the early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically
significant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical
scenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3
power-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\Omega_{\rm
GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.0\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement
over previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to
$\Omega_{\rm GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.8\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x
sensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting
non-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise
sources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with
population models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we
find our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are
approaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits
shown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary
black hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference
results and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background
arising from compact binary coalescences is $\Omega_{\rm CBC}(25{\rm

  strongly lensed gravitational wave</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xikai Shan, Huan Yang, Shude Mao, Otto A. Hannuksela</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Comments are welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Microlensing induced by the stellar field within a strong lensing galaxy can
introduce fluctuations in the waveforms of strongly-lensed gravitational
waves.When fitting these signals with templates that do not account for
microlensing,possible degeneracies can lead to false evidence of certain
intrinsic parameters,resulting in a misinterpretation of the properties of the
underlying system.For example,the wave effect of microlensing may mimic spin
precessions,as both effects generically induce periodic waveform
modulations.Although previous studies suggest that lensing-induced modulations
can be distinguished from precession using parameter estimation under a
geometric-optic approximation,it does not directly apply for lensed image
through stellar fields due to large number of stars involved an wave-optic
effects.This study aims to evaluate the degree of degeneracy between the
stellar-field microlensing and spin precession,investigating whether
microlensing leads false evidence of precession.In other words,to what extent
observed SLGWs are identified with false evidence of precession.The main
findings are as follows.First,assuming O5 sensitivity and parallel spins for
the underlying binary black holes,microlensing-induced false evidence of
precession is generally weak(15% of the events show significant evidence,30% if
the signal-to-noise ratio doubles).Second,for highly magnified events,about 72%
of the population show significant evidence of precession,which could serve as
an identification criterion for microlensing.This implies the possibility of
strong lensing for the recent event GW231123,which is in the mass gap and also
shows evidence of precession.Finally,a moderate to strong positive correlation
exists between microlensing strength and precession evidence,more pronounced in
Type II SLGWs.This suggests that stronger precession evidence may imply a
stronger microlensing effect.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21519v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole
  Spacetimes in Plasma</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jonibek Khasanov, Mirzabek Alloqulov, Pankaj Sheoran, Sanjar Shaymatov, Hemwati Nandan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 14 captioned figures, and 3 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically
symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in
a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and
precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave
dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by
analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon
structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic
fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma
environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles
and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and
power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical
settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of
the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's
method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave
equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB
approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and
examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we
perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to
constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT
and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a
unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with
lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future
comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</p></br></body>
