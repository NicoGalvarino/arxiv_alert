absorption line and electron temperature (T$_e$) based metallicity, using the
temperature sensitive [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line detected in the
JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of the host of GRB 050505 at redshift $z=4.28$. We find
that the metallicity of the cold interstellar gas, derived from the absorption
lines in the GRB afterglow, of 12 + log(O/H)$\sim 7.7$ is in reasonable
agreement with the temperature-based emission line metallicity in the warm gas
of the GRB host galaxy, which has values of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.80$\pm$0.19 and
7.96$\pm$0.21 for two common indicators. When using strong emission line
diagnostics appropriate for high-z galaxies and sensitive to ionisation
parameter, we find good agreement between the strong emission line metallicity
and the other two methods. Our results imply that, for the host of GRB050505,
mixing between the warm and the cold ISM along the line of sight to the GRB is
efficient, and that GRB afterglow absorption lines can be a reliable tracer of
the metallicity of the galaxy. If confirmed with a large sample, this suggest
that metallicities determined via GRB afterglow spectroscopy can be used to
trace cosmic chemical evolution to the earliest cosmic epochs and in galaxies
far too faint for emission line spectroscopy, even for JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08116v1" target="_blank"><h2>The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the
  first billion years: implications for JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pratika Dayal, Roberto maiolino</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A; comments welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new
window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These
show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes
in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios
of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical"
seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological"
primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic
framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in
the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses
between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass
function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z
\sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly,
PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high
values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar
mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim
0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded
models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of
producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are
extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter
fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of
magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current
cosmological and astrophysical bounds.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08497v1" target="_blank"><h2>Catalog of very-high-energy emitting active galactic nuclei at high

Semikoz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) producing Very-High-Energy (VHE)
gamma-rays (energies above 100~GeV) has been revealed using observations with
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). However, our knowledge of the
VHE emitting AGN population is limited in the absence of an unbiased sky
survey. We use long exposure of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to perform a
survey of VHE emitting AGN at Galactic latitudes |b|>10 degrees. We consider
clustering of gamma-ray events with energies E>100 GeV around positions of AGN
from the 4-th LAT source catalog to select sources detected in the VHE range.
The VHE AGN catalog produced in this way contains overall 175 sources detected
with high confidence and additional 100 sources detected at more than 3-sigma
level. It is 90% complete at the flux limit 1.3e-12 erg/cm2s. Less than half of
the source sample (71) are previously reported VHE emitters, other sources are
new detections in the VHE band. The majority of VHE AGN detectable at the
survey flux limit are BL Lac type objects. We find their luminosity function to
derive their spatial density (6.5+/-0.5)e-7/ Mpc3 and the characteristic
luminosity scale ~1e44 erg/s. Ten sources in the VHE AGN catalog are nearby
radio galaxies and seven are flat spectrum radio quasars, while 20 sources are
unclassified AGN. We also include in our catalog four unidentified sources that
may or may not be VHE AGN. 63 source in the catalog are "extreme" blazars, with
41 of them being new VHE band detections. In spite of the fact that the VHE
flux is heavily attenuated by the pair production in interactions with
Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), the catalog includes 7 sources at
redshift larger than 1. Some of these sources show peculiar hardening of the
VHE band spectra that point either to errors in redshift determination, or to
limitations of modeling of cosmological evolution of EBL.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07432v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on cosmology and baryonic feedback with joint analysis of

obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey
and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear
(which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the
projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and
the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of
baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ
cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after
minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By
jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the
shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$
and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary
CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas
pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}/h$,
supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas
thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a
$2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild
baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally,
we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear

Spoon, Rosita Paladino, Michele Perna, Cristian Vignali</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 00183-7111 ($z=0.328$) is one
of the three ULIRGs that are currently known to host an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) with young radio jets. We present a detailed study of the link between
galaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and galactic-scale molecular
outflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and
$^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging.
The latter allows us to put - for the first time - tight constraints on the
assembly history of the system, confirming that it formed through a major
merger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde
encounter and no older than 2 Gyr. The recent merger channelled about
$(1.0\pm0.1)\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas in the central regions
of the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between
the CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely
contributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio
jets, which are no older than 2 Myr. Furthermore, by comparing the relative
strength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e.
$T_{\rm ex}\gg50$ K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM
interaction. A qualitative study of the CO kinematics also demonstrates that,
despite the overall disturbed dynamical state with no clear signs of regular
rotation, at least one non-rotational kinematic component can be identified and
likely associated to an outflow with $v_{\rm out}\approx 556$ km s$^{-1}$ and
$\dot{M_{\rm out}}\approx 110$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08853v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MeerKAT Massive Distant Clusters Survey: Detection of Diffuse Radio

provides insights into cosmic structure formation, the growth of magnetic
fields, and turbulence. This paper reports a search for diffuse radio emission
in a pilot sample of six high-redshift ($1.01 < z < 1.31$) galaxy clusters from
the MeerKAT Massive Distant Cluster Survey (MMDCS). These six clusters are
selected as the most massive $(M_{\rm 500c} = 6.7\,- 8.5 \times
10^{14}~\rm{M_{\odot}})$ systems based on their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich mass from
the full MMDCS sample of 30 ACT DR5 clusters, and were observed first to
explore the high-mass, high-redshift regime. Diffuse radio emission is
confidently detected in four clusters and tentatively identified in two, with
$k$-corrected radio powers scaled to 1.4 GHz ranging from $(0.46 \pm 0.16)$ to
$(4.51 \pm 1.68) \times 10^{24}\, \mathrm{WHz^{-1}}$ and linear sizes between
0.47 and 1.08 Mpc. Combining $Chandra$ X-ray data with MeerKAT radio data, we
find that 80$\%$ of clusters with X-ray observations exhibit disturbed
morphologies indicative of mergers. These $z > 1$ galaxy clusters scatter
around the established radio power-mass scaling relation observed at lower
redshifts, supporting turbulent re-acceleration models in high-redshift
mergers. However, their radio spectra are predicted to steepen ($\alpha <
-1.5$) due to enhanced inverse Compton losses in the cosmic microwave
background, rendering them under-luminous at 1.4 GHz and placing them below the
correlation. Our results demonstrate that merger-driven turbulence can sustain
radio halos even at $z > 1$ while highlighting MeerKAT's unique ability to
probe non-thermal processes in the early universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08925v1" target="_blank"><h2>Splashback radius and the mass accretion rate of RASS MCMF galaxy

density around X-ray selected ROSAT All Sky Survey-Multi-Component Matched
Filter galaxy clusters using Year 3 data from the Dark Energy Survey. We
measure the projected cross-correlation signal of the RedMaGiC "high density"
galaxies around an approximately volume-limited sample of 255 galaxy clusters
at a median redshift of $z=0.4$ and an X-ray luminosity $L_X > 10^{44}

measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.41 allows us to infer a 3D number
density profile which shows a significant steepening at the edges of these
galaxy clusters, namely the splashback radius of $r_{sp}$ /$h^{-1}
\mathrm{M_{\odot}} = 2.19^{+0.50}_{-0.43}$. We present the dependence of the
splashback radius value over a range of absolute galaxy magnitude cuts to look
for any evidence of dynamical friction affecting these results. The weak
lensing signal around our galaxy clusters measured with a signal-to-noise ratio
of 32.19 allows us to infer a halo mass $\text{log} (M_{\rm 200m} / h^{-1}
\text{Mpc}) = 14.68_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. Comparison of the location of the
splashback radius with the spherical overdensity boundary $r_{\rm 200m}$ shows
consistency with the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ predictions. We present the first
inference of the average mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters using our
measurements of the splashback radius.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08995v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the physical properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at

present-day massive spheroidal galaxies (proto-spheroids) can be constrained by
the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-South field,
which benefits from extensive photometric and spectroscopic data, including
those from the Hubble, Spitzer and Herschel. We adopted a physical model for
the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies, which form the bulk of dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z>=1.5 and confirmed its consistency with
recent mid-infrared high-z galaxy luminosity functions. Using the model and the
JADES survey strategy, we simulated a sample of proto-spheroids over 87.5
arcmin^2, matching the JADES/GOODS-S survey area. Photometric redshifts
estimated from simulated JWST photometry showed >=95% accuracy and were used in
SED fitting with CIGALE. We demonstrated that JWST will provide reliable
stellar mass estimates up to 0.1 dex for the majority of proto-spheroids at
z>=1.5 and can detect low-mass systems during cosmic noon that were
inaccessible in the pre-JWST era. Focusing on the active star-forming phase of
the proto-spheroid evolution, we defined a sub-sample flux limited at 250
micron (DSFG sample) and derived SFR, dust luminosity and dust mass
complementing the JWST photometry with that from Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel. We
also constructed a JWST-selected DSFG catalog from ASTRODEEP data using NIRCam
colour criteria and demonstrated strong consistency between the observed and
simulated DSFG populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08469v1" target="_blank"><h2>The connection between galaxy mergers, star formation and AGN activity

dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially
challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these
analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility
that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis
of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite.
Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo
properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that
are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite
also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While
high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically
preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while
also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical
expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that
neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are
artificially compact.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07783v1" target="_blank"><h2>Traces of the evolution of cosmic void galaxies: An Integral Field

Ruiz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies in the most underdense regions of the Universe, known as cosmic
voids, exhibit astrophysical properties that suggest a distinct evolutionary
path compared to galaxies in denser environments. Numerical simulations
indicate that the assembly of void galaxies occurs later, leading to galaxies
with younger stellar populations, low metallicities, and a high gas content in
their halos, which provides the fuel to sustain elevated star formation
activity. Our objective in this work is to test these numerical predictions
with observational data by comparing galaxies in voids with galaxies in
non-void environments. We used voids identified in SDSS data and galaxies from
the MaNGA survey, which provides galaxies with integral field spectroscopy
(IFS). We separated the galaxies into void and non-void samples, mimicked the
magnitude distribution, and compared their integrated astrophysical properties
as well as the metallicity and age profiles through a stacking technique, ETGs
and LTGs separately. We find that void galaxies have younger and less
metal-rich stellar populations. Regarding gas mass, we do not find differences
across environments. When dividing galaxies into ETGs and LTGs, we observe that
ETGs show negative gradients in both age and metallicity, with void galaxies
consistently appearing younger and less metal-rich. For LTGs, age gradients are
also negative, showing younger populations in void galaxies. However, we do not
find statistically significant differences in stellar metallicity gradients
between void and non-void environments. Our results show how the astrophysical
properties of galaxies in voids differ from those of galaxies in the rest of
the Universe. This suggests that the void environment plays a role in the
evolution of its galaxies, delaying their assembly and growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08439v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of Odd Radio Circles and Other Peculiars in the First Year of

two additional candidate ORCs, expanding the known population of these objects.
In addition to ORCs, we also identify 55 Galaxies with Large-scale Ambient

These GLAREs may represent different evolutionary stages of ORCs, and studying

wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to
reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We
point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$
is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on
the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel.
The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry,
islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model
predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a
function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number
density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same
redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an
AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of
the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and
NSCs out to high redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08545v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fading in the Flow: Suppression of cold gas growth in expanding galactic
  outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alankar Dutta, Prateek Sharma, Max Gronke</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 20 figures, 1 table; submitted to MNRAS; comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Multiwavelength observations reveal multiphase outflows that play a crucial
role in redistributing gas and metals in and around galaxies. Theoretical
modelling of such multiphase outflows often employs wind tunnel simulations of
a spherical cold ($\sim 10^4 \ \rm K$) cloud facing a uniform hot ($\sim 10^6\
\rm K$) wind. However, outflows are naturally expanding and wind conditions
change downstream -- a crucial aspect overlooked in most idealized simulations.
To address this, we examine how an expanding wind influences the survival,
morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We perform idealized hydrodynamic
simulations of radiative cloud-crushing in an expanding wind, where the steady
background wind is modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier & Clegg 1985 (CC85)
analytic solution. Moving downstream, we find that the clouds remain locally
isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast
with respect to the ambient medium, and they eventually dissipate into the
wind. This also suppresses the growth of cold gas mass in comparison to a
plane-parallel wind since entrained clouds move into a less radiative
background. Using analytic scaling arguments, we present a physical picture of
cloud evolution in a CC85 wind. Cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium
are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional homogeneous wind
tunnel simulations, our simulations account for the differential expansion
experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds moving in an outflow.
Consequently, a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold
gas tails develop -- features closer to observations. In addition, we
demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds may substantially alter the
radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08932v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measurement of the Dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$Galaxy Cross-Power

Stairs</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can serve as a
powerful probe of the diffuse plasma between and surrounding galaxies, which
contains most of the Universe's baryons. By cross-correlating the dispersion of
background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the
relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50
Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation.
Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy
angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB
Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift
bins spanning $0.05 < z <0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the
first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure
due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with
caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic
errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power
spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale
$k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent
with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with
group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback
processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the
physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as
FRB surveys expand.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08077v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST interferometric imaging reveals the dusty disk obscuring the

Lau, Deepashri Thatte, Ismael Garcia-Bernete, Julien H. Girard, Matthew J. Hankins</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> In review at Nature Communications. 7 pages, 3 figures (Methods: 10 pages, 7 figures)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The dusty and molecular torus is one of the most elusive structures
surrounding supermassive black holes, yet its importance is unequivocal for
understanding feedback and accretion mechanisms. The torus and accretion disk
feed the inspiraling gas onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and launch
outflows, fundamentally connecting the SMBH activity to the host galaxy. This
scenario situates the torus as the interface between the AGN and its host
galaxy with a flow cycle of molecular gas and dust of a few parsecs in size.
Here, we utilize a novel aperture-masking interferometric mode onboard the
JWST, achieving twice the previously possible resolution, and bringing out the
fainter features that clearly show the torus being the critical interface for
feeding material from galaxy scales into the SMBH. We also identify that $<1$%
of the emission arises from an arc structure composed of hot dust entrained in
a molecular and ionized outflow. The rest of the emission, $12$%, is associated
with dust heated by the AGN and/or radio-jet at large scales. Combined with
continuum data, gas tracers, and torus models, our study shows that most of the
dust mass is located in the equatorial axis in the form of a disk feeding the
AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08368v1" target="_blank"><h2>Prospects for Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Science with eXTP</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shu-Xu Yi, Wen Zhao, Ren-Xin Xu, Xue-Feng Wu, Giulia Stratta, Simone Dall'Osso, Yan-Jun Xu, Andrea Santangelo, Silvia Zane, Shuang-Nan Zhang, Hua Feng, Huan Yang, Junjie Mao, Junqiang Ge, Lijing Shao, Mi-Xiang Lan, He Gao, Lin Lin, Ning Jiang, Qingwen Wu, Tong Liu, Yun-Wei Yu, Xiang-Yu Wang, Jin Zhang, Dafne Guetta, Jin-Jun Geng, Di Xiao, Yong-Feng Huang, Yacheng Kang, Tian-Yong Cao, Zhen Zhang, Zhenwei Lyu, Zhen Pan, Yunfeng Chen, Yong Gao, Ang Li, Yu-Cong Fu, Shuo Xiao, Wei-Yang Wang, Fayin Wang, Zhenyin Zhao, Weihua Lei, Rong-Feng Shen, Lixin Dai, Guang-Lei Wu, Liang-Duan Liu, Jin Zhang, Xilong Fan, Xing-Jiang Zhu, Youjun Lu, Fan Xu, Kangfa Cheng, Da-Bin Lin, Xiao-Hong Zhao, Jun-Jie We, Bin-Bin Zhang, Ji-Rong Mao, Yongquan Xue, Xinwen Shu, Wenjie Zhang, Wei-Li Lin, Achille Fiore, Zhuo Li, Antonio Martin-Carrillo, Joseph Fisher, Fei Xie, Ye Li, Sandro Mereghetti, Shao-Lin Xiong, Yu-Han Yang, Eleonora Troja, Zi-Gao Dai, Da-Ming We, En-Wei Liang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to the SCIENCE CHINA Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new

high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential
time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave
(GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts
(FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and

Accepted for publication in MNRAS on 5 June 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a census of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nucleus (AGN)
population and the column density ($N_{\rm{H}}$) distribution of AGN in our
cosmic backyard using a mid-infrared selected AGN sample within 15 Mpc. The
column densities are measured from broadband X-ray spectral analysis, mainly
using data from $\textit{Chandra}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. Our sample probes AGN
with intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $L_{\rm 2-10, int} = 10^{37}$-$10^{43}$
erg s$^{-1}$, reaching a parameter space inaccessible to more distant samples.
We directly measure a 32$^{+30}_{-18}\%$ CT AGN fraction and obtain an
$N_{\rm{H}}$ distribution that agrees with that inferred by the
$\textit{Swift}$-BAT survey. Restricting the sample to the largely unexplored
domain of low-luminosity AGN with $L_{\rm 2-10, int}$ $\leq$ $10^{42}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, we found a CT fraction of 19$^{+30}_{-14}\%$, consistent with those
observed at higher luminosities. Comparing the host-galaxy properties between
the two samples, we find consistent star formation rates, though the majority
of our galaxy have lower stellar masses (by $\approx 0.3$ dex). In contrast,
the two samples have very different black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$)
distributions, with our sample having $\approx$1.5 dex lower mean mass ($M_{\rm
BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$). Additionally, our sample contains a
significantly higher number of LINERs and H$_{\rm{II}}$-type nuclei. The
Eddington ratio range probed by our sample, however, is the same as
$\textit{Swift}$-BAT, although the latter dominates at higher accretion rates,
and our sample is more evenly distributed. The majority of our sample with
$\lambda_{\rm Edd} \ge$ 10$^{-3}$ tend to be CT, while those with $\lambda_{\rm
Edd} <$ 10$^{-3}$ are mostly unobscured or mildly obscured.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07457v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Internal Kinematics, Stellar Population, and Gas-phase Properties of
  The Pseudobulge in An Ultra-diffuse Galaxy: AGC721966</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shihong Liu, Yu Rong, Huiyuan Wang, Hong-Xin Zhang, Tie Li, Yao Yao, Zhicheng He, Teng Liu, Enci Wang, Cheng Cheng, Xu Kong</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ Letters; comments welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Leveraging spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the central stellar velocity dispersion, stellar
population properties, star formation history, and gas-phase chemical
abundances in AGC721966, a unique ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) harboring a
pseudobulge. Our findings reveal that the pseudobulge formed in the early
universe but underwent a recent episode of rejuvenated star formation. The
system exhibits a mass-weighted (light-weighted) stellar population age of
$\tau_{\star}\sim 7.4\pm2.5$ ($2.9\pm1.5$)~Gyr, a stellar metallicity of
[M/H]$\sim -0.62\pm0.26$ ($-0.55\pm0.20$), an $\alpha$-element enhancement of
[$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim 0.36\pm0.09$ ($0.37\pm0.07$), and a gas-phase oxygen
abundance of \Oabund$\sim 8.15\pm0.03$. The central stellar velocity dispersion
is measured as $\sigma_{\rm c}\sim 57.9\pm15.7$~km/s. These results provide
robust evidence supporting the early halo-halo merging formation scenario
proposed by \cite{Rong25}, while unequivocally ruling out the ``failed''
$L^{\star}$ formation model, at least for AGC721966. Furthermore, through
systematic application of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we establish that
these pseudobulge-hosting UDGs are neither misidentified nuclear star
cluster-bearing dwarf galaxies nor bulge-dominated massive galaxies, thereby
affirming their distinct evolutionary pathway.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08751v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM insights for interstellar Sulfur</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lia Corrales, Elisa Costantini, Sascha Zeeger, Liyi Gu, Hiromitsu Takahashi, David Moutard, Megumi Shidatsu, Jon M.

Kilbourne</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted for publication in PASJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral
resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from
the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the
high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the
spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of
this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that
it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8
+/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most
recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a
systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of
disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks
observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K
region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra
of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS),
pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the
residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three
compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust
grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0
sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40%
+/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of
interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of < 25%, which is consistent with
prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this
study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the
Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S
depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.</p></br></body>
