  Active Galaxy CGCG 012-070</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lucas Ramos Vieira, Rogemar A. Riffel, Rogério Riffel, Oli L.

compared to star-forming galaxies, likely driven by outflows and shocks
inferred from integrated spectra. We present optical IFU observations of the
central 2\,kpc of the AGN host CGCG 012-070, selected for its pronounced H$_2$
emission excess, to map stellar and gas kinematics. The stellar velocity field
is well described by a rotating disc with a line of nodes at $103^\circ \pm
4^\circ$, with the northwest side approaching and the southeast side receding.
Gas kinematics, traced by strong emission lines, show two components: a narrow
one ($\sigma \lesssim 200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) in the disc plane following
stellar motions, and a broad ($\sigma \gtrsim 300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$)
associated with outflows within the inner $\sim$1\,kpc. Disc gas emission is
mainly driven by AGN photoionization, while the outflow also includes
shock-heated gas, as indicated by flux ratio diagnostics. The outflows are
radiatively driven, with a mass-outflow rate of $(0.067 \pm
0.026)\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and a kinetic coupling efficiency of 0.07%,
potentially redistributing gas and contributing to maintenance-mode feedback in
CGCG 012-070. Our results provide further evidence that the warm H$_2$ emission
excess in nearby AGN is associated with shocks produced by outflows.
Observations of other gas phases, such as cold molecular gas, are necessary to
gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the outflows on the
host galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20173v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Tale of Tails: Star Formation and Stripping in Jellyfish Galaxies in
  the Strong Lensing Cluster MACS J0138.0-2155</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Catherine C. Gibson, Jackson H. O'Donnell, Tesla E. Jeltema</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 19 figures, submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (abstract), kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the effects of ram-pressure stripping on four galaxies within
the massive, strong-lensing cluster MACS-J0138.0-2155 ($z=0.336$). Of these,
three are classified as jellyfish galaxies, with significant elongated tails.
Two of these jellyfish galaxies, J1 and J2, are in a late-stage of stripping
and show post-starburst features within their disk regions with star formation
only in the tails. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic data, we
spatially resolve the stellar and gas kinematics to examine extraplanar gas
associated with ram-pressure stripping. We complement this analysis with
optical and near-infrared imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to visualize
the galactic structure of each member. The jellyfish galaxies are all
blue-shifted with respect to the cluster and show velocity gradients of a few
hundred $\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ across their tails. From the resolved gas
kinematics, we derive H$\alpha$-based star formation rates; these are generally
low reaching a maximum of approximately 0.49
$\mathrm{M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}kpc^{-2}}$ in galaxy J3. We also report the
kinematics for galaxy J4, which lies in the foreground of the cluster but close
in projection to one of the lensed arcs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20157v1" target="_blank"><h2>The First RELHIC? Cloud-9 is a Starless Gas Cloud</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gagandeep S. Anand, Alejandro Benítez-Llambay, Rachael Beaton, Andrew J. Fox, Julio F.

Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been
confirmed independently by VLA and GBT observations. Cloud-9 has the same
recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4
Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold
($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim
10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search
for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any
dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust
color-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar
counterpart with 99.5$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component
reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI
Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas
in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make
Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This
provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model,
namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic
mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy
formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20711v1" target="_blank"><h2>HSTPROMO Internal Proper Motion Kinematics of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies:

Submitted, comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyze three epochs of HST imaging over 20 years for the Sculptor dwarf
spheroidal galaxy, measuring precise proper motions for 119 stars and combining
them with 1760 existing line-of-sight velocities. This catalog yields the first
radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild
oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$
beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in
this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to
infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy
due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical
symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of
dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain
the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity
moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree
models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on)
configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons
($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark
matter density slope of $\Gamma_{\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the
radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\Gamma_{\rm
dark} \leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower
inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The
results qualitatively agree with $\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios
that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide
quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or
particle masses required by these models, respectively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20507v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forecasting 21-cm power spectrum sensitivity to dark Matter-baryon
  scattering</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aryan Rahimieh, Priyank Parashari, Vera Gluscevic</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables. Published in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore the potential of upcoming 21-cm interferometric observations to
probe interacting dark matter (IDM). We focus on scenarios where the dark
matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\sigma(v) =\sigma_{0} v^n$,
with $\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity
between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity
dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n
= -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed
simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we
forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA),
which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical
parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star
formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity.
Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can
significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor
of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more
than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts
also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave
background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also
shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters
associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction
of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is
positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical
role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust
inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum
observations.</p></br></body>
