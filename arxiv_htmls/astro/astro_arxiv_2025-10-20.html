conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can
form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and
dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins
to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion
decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering.
We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass
simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray
spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and
hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux
from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the
measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict
multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially
providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic
medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14529v1" target="_blank"><h2>The variability of active galaxies: I. Broad-band noise X-ray power

of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show
dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The
power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law
that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high
frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the
mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the
`X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly
sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous
paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power
law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56
variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the
$0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends
in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We
also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We
update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements
spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends
in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H
1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15822v1" target="_blank"><h2>The kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich effect as a benchmark for AGN feedback

hydrodynamical simulations, with different prescriptions producing divergent
predictions for the fraction of gas expelled from halos, the radial extent of
the gas expulsion and the impact on large scale matter clustering. We present
the first systematic study of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect
across a wide range of simulations (FLAMINGO, ANTILLES, BAHAMAS, SIMBA, FABLE
and their variants), and compare them directly to DESI Year 1 + ACT kSZ
measurements. We ensure a like-for-like comparison with observations by
developing a robust methodology that accounts for the halo mass selection using
galaxy-galaxy lensing, cosmic variance, miscentering and satellites,
establishing the kSZ effect as a new benchmark for the simulations. We find
that fiducial feedback models are disfavoured by >3 sigma, while simulations
with more powerful AGN feedback within the FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS suites, as well
as SIMBA, reproduce the observed kSZ signal within <2 sigma. We use the
ANTILLES simulation suite to demonstrate that the amplitude of the kSZ effect
is a strong predictor of matter power spectrum suppression, competitive with
baryon fraction metrics. These results establish the kSZ as a critical probe
for evaluating feedback physics and for advancing the fidelity of cosmological
simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14715v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE (I): Forward Shock</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Guobin Mou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent long-term radio monitoring of tidal disruption events (TDEs) suggests
that radio afterglows are common. Most studies argue that these afterglows may
arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE
outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical
models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which
introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study
the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the
synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with
non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are
explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a
Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance
of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early
times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of
the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline
pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are
clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred
from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly
from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those
from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14775v1" target="_blank"><h2>CHILLING: Continuum Halos in LVHIS Local Irregular Nearby Galaxies -

critical environments for studying feedback mechanisms from star formation and
its impacts on dwarf galaxy evolution. In particular, radio continuum (RC)
observations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a
significant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the
detectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15
dwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs)
spanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using
multi-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact
Array, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and
explore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is
detected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission
correlates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass,
while dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no
significant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that
the RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a
simple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more
complex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms
that a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral
shapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches.
Additionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic
ray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can
escape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15634v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) - VI: $γ$-ray Emission in the Local

scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and

would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark
matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic
web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first
cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR
injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR
protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated
CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions,
which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing
direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR
proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy
clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below
the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model,
a sensitivity of $F_\gamma < 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$
is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14766v1" target="_blank"><h2>Predicting the Subhalo Mass Functions in Simulations from Galaxy Images</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andreas Filipp, Tri Nguyen, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur, Jonah Rose, Chris Lovell, Nicolas Payot, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Yashar Hezaveh</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Published as a workshop paper at the ML4Astro Workshop at ICML 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to directly infer the
dark matter (DM) subhalo mass function (SHMF) in lens galaxies. However,
comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains
challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies -
even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties
and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework
to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on
the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\rm DM}$. To train the
model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the
DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas
particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder.
Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM
mass. This method enables scalable, image-based predictions for the theoretical
DM SHMFs of individual galaxies, facilitating direct comparisons with
observational measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14938v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray panorama of the SS433/W50 complex by SRG/eROSITA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rashid Sunyaev, Ildar Khabibullin, Eugene Churazov, Marat Gilfanov, Pavel Medvedev, Sergey Sazonov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12+2 pages, 9 figures, submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galactic microquasar SS433 and the radio nebula W50 surrounding it present a

by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray

time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and acceleration. They have also been
advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their
transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected
EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We
revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of
recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy
(AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the
transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of
electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed
fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different
absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein
the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is
sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is
negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving
$^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant
uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections. This first
analysis calls for further investigation, as several forthcoming projects
(e.g., TIGERISS) are targeting $Z>30$ cosmic rays.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14779v1" target="_blank"><h2>The dark side of early galaxies: $\texttt{geko}$ uncovers dark-matter

typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model
the H$\alpha$ morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift $z\approx4$-6 from
FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the $\texttt{geko}$ code, and
infer rotational velocities and dispersions within $r_{\rm e}$. Our sample
spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses
are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter
(DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r<r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light
radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and
$\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect
to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass.
About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc.
Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with
simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to
higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter,
suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We
measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface
density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic
noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles
coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest
$f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest
fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic
contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at
$z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at
$z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14380v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust extinction map of the Galactic plane based on the UKIDSS survey

Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with
high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical
wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method
based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the
previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective
mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust
structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate
extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying
XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey,
we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that
span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l <
232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and
300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers
higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions
compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane,
providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15823v1" target="_blank"><h2>Very Massive Stars and High N/O: A Tale of the Nitrogen-enriched Super

Lyman-continuum (LyC) leaking super star cluster, which powers a compact ($<
10\,\rm pc$), high-pressure nebula at sub-solar metallicity $\sim0.2\,Z_\odot$
and with an anomalously elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio $\log({\rm N/O}) \sim
-0.2$. We present semi-analytic models and 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations
with radiative feedback in an attempt to reproduce this system. The results
indicate that the progenitor giant molecular cloud (GMC) may have $M_{\rm

corresponding to a surface density $\sim10^3$--$10^4\,M_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$.
Incorporating feedback from individual Very Massive Stars (VMSs; $\ge
100\,M_\odot$) sampled from the Kroupa initial mass function, we find that
their winds rapidly enrich $\sim 10^4\,M_\odot$ of nearby gas with nitrogen
($\sim 1\,$dex) and helium ($\sim 0.1$--$0.2\,$dex). In the first
$1$--$3\,$Myr, some cold gas falls to the system center where a central cluster
builds up from sub-cluster mergers. There, the gas is photoionized,
pressurized, and chemically enriched by the newly formed VMSs, before being
radiatively expelled in the next $\sim1\,\rm Myr$. We find that both VMS
feedback and a high-surface-density progenitor GMC are necessary to reproduce
the observed nebular properties, such as high N/O, high pressure, and stellar
proximity. Low metallicity ($Z \le 0.004$) may be essential to avoid
overproduction of carbon from WC stars. Such enrichment processes localized to
compact starburst events may have caused strong nitrogen emission from dense
ionized gas as observed in high-redshift galaxies such as GN-z11 and GS_3073.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14390v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence for the dynamical dark energy with evolving Hubble constant</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yi-Ying Wang, Yin-Jie Li, Yi-Zhong Fan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), Euclid (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical

the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent
reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an
evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with
multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift
and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$.
Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating
the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is
strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic
Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior
assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven
reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from
Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these
results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the

observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
(FAST) for a representative sample of 78 low-redshift massive quiescent
galaxies, selected by stellar mass ($M_\ast > 10^{10} M_\odot$) and color
(NUV$-r > 5$). Our observations reach an exceptional detection limit of
$\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) = -3$. We find that one-third of the sample follows the
predicted HI mass fraction distribution based on previous surveys. However, the
majority ($\sim$2/3) exhibit significantly lower HI content, with a $3\sigma$
upper limit of $\log(M_{HI}/M_\ast) < -3.46$ derived from stacking the
non-detections. As a consequence of this enormous dynamic range and the high
fraction of non-detections, the HI mass fraction shows no clear correlation
with parameters tracing star formation, structure, or morphology. Our FAST
sample shows remarkable similarity to the $ATLAS^{3D}$ sample which only
includes early-type galaxies, both in its high fraction of HI-poor galaxies and
its high satellite fraction among HI-poor galaxies, as indicated by three
different environmental characteristics: projected cross-correlation functions,
background-subtracted neighbour counts, and central/satellite classification in
the SDSS galaxy group catalog. These results suggest that while early-type
morphology and environment play crucial roles in suppressing HI reservoirs,
neither factor alone fully explains the observed gas depletion, indicating that
additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the extreme HI

Submitted to PRD</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of
plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible
progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white
dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal
disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole.
Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the
kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a
two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole
spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni
radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses
using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance
through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our
results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing
a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a
${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of
$0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within
this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} =
1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$,
with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} =
471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the
observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic
velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the
required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within
$v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and

formation, black hole growth, and mass build-up of galaxies at later cosmic
times, but their effect is poorly understood at high redshift ($z>2$). We use
JADES data to analyse a mass-complete sample of 2095 galaxies at $z=3-9$ with
${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, identifying major merger pairs
(projected separation of $5-100$ pkpc, mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) using a
probabilistic method. To look for signatures of enhancement in multiple
physical properties, we carefully build a control sample of non-pairs that are
simultaneously matched in redshift, stellar mass, isolation, and environment to
the pair sample. We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate
(sSFR) of $1.12 \pm 0.05$ at separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc, which is weakly
detectable out to $\sim50$ kpc. We find that at longer averaging timescales
(50-100 Myr) the sSFR is more affected by interactions and environment, whereas
at shorter timescales (5-10 Myr) it is dominated by internal feedback and
burstiness. By averaging star formation histories, we find two distinct
populations: pre-first passage/coalescence (monotonically rising SFR) and
post-pericentre pairs (earlier peak in SFR). Finally, we find no significant
excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively
triggering black hole activity at separations $>5$ kpc. Similarly, we also do
not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in pairs,
implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient
at enhancing Lyman-$\alpha$ photon production and escape, which may only become
important at the smallest scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14613v1" target="_blank"><h2>The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the

supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational
wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We
develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to
estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA
experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing
above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the
current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least
one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $>3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like
sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by
hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with
chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent
massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW
candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more
massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these
systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington
ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}>10^{-3}$ can still
outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as
the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical
and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and
biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in
the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We
find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower
slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent

star-forming rings of four disk galaxies (NGC 613, NGC 1097, NGC 3351, NGC
7552) is presented. Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old
stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the
old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of
metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The
young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all
galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar.
Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar
age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the
average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include
contributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of
the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population
synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust
lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of
interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar
clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar
winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of
extinction are detected.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14441v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accounting for the absence of anomalous microwave emission in the M 31

comprehension of galactic halos. A crucial step forward is that of estimating
the fraction of missing baryons in the halos, but it relies on understanding
the real cause of the observed CMB temperature asymmetry since many effects
might give a non-negligible contribution. Here, we analyzed the contribution
played by the anomalous microwave emission (AME) from halo dust grains in the
halo of the M 31 galaxy. Assuming either amorphous carbon and silicates dust
grains with size ranging from $0.01~\mu$m to about $0.3~\mu$m and mass in the
range $10^{-14} - 10^{-13}$ g, we estimated the total mass, distribution, and
diffuse emission in the $100\,\mu$m band of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite

the M 31 halo and compared the obtained values with the \textit{Planck}'s
SMICA-processed data. We find that the AME cannot account for the measured CMB
temperature asymmetry, with its contribution constrained to $\lesssim 7\%$,
thereby indicating that additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for
the observed signal.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14953v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Matter Subhalos and Higher Order Catastrophes in Gravitational Wave

and the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for
unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to
the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of
the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly
lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos:
\emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative
magnification ($\mu_r > 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the
caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for
$\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models,
and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images,
which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find
that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in
our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of
low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in
lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction
integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We
also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the
distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo
populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the
upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based
detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide
insight into the nature of dark matter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15650v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transverse BAO scale measurement at $z_{\rm eff} = 1.725$ with the SDSS

Gaussian function-we measure the transverse BAO scale as $\theta_{\rm
BAO}=1.928^{\circ}\pm0.094^{\circ}$. This measurement is obtained from a narrow
redshift shell, $z \in [1.72, 1.73]$ (i.e., $\Delta z=0.01$), thin enough that
projection-effect corrections are negligible, making it only weakly dependent
on the assumed fiducial cosmology. The only assumption adopted is isotropy in
the computation of the correlation function, further ensuring that the result
depends only weakly on specific cosmological-model hypotheses. We also
investigate possible systematics that could affect the detection or
significance of the BAO signal and find them to be subdominant or implausible.
When combined with other transverse BAO measurements from the literature, our
result shows good concordance-within the $1\sigma$ confidence level-with the
cosmological parameter values reported by the Planck and DESI collaborations.
This new measurement of the transverse BAO scale, obtained from the SDSS quasar
sample with minimal cosmological-model assumptions, provides an additional
independent constraint for updated statistical studies aimed at probing the

depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the $z = 0$ FMR has
not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime ($\rm
log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$) for an appropriate comparison of low- and
high-$z$ systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a
meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-$z$
FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for $\sim 700$
[OIII]$\lambda 4363$ emitters with $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 9$ at
$z \sim 0$. We find no evidence of the FMR below $\rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})
\lesssim 9$ through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady
state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak
positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these
systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields ($y_{\rm
eff}$) spanning $\rm \sim 3~dex$. We demonstrate increasing $y_{\rm eff}$
correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical
and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario
where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before
subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot
lead to the $y_{\rm eff}$ diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary
process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-$\rm M_{\star}$ systems,
regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the
canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star
formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate $z
\gtrsim 3$ [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ systems are indeed more metal-poor than $z \sim
0$ counterparts ($\rm \Delta 12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex$) at fixed $\rm M_{\star}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15661v1" target="_blank"><h2>Born to be recycled: a comprehensive population synthesis of the

Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date.
To explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated:
the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from
a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population
synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check
whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion
mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to
obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys.
Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body
(SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve
each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a
force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and
spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence
companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission
locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model,
respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio
and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that
there should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT
catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle
$\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it
also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis
and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10${\deg}). We find that only a small
fraction, approximately $\sim 7.5\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs
(ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly
recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15389v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence for cloud-to-cloud variations in the ratio of polarized thermal

dust emission can be used to infer intrinsic dust properties. This correlation
is quantified by the ratio Rp/p, which has been measured to be 5.42 +/- 0.05
MJy sr^-1 at 353 GHz when averaged over large areas of the sky. We investigate
this correlation using newly published stellar polarimetric data densely
sampling a continuous sky region of ~4 square degrees at intermediate Galactic
latitude. We combine RoboPol optical polarization measurements for 1,430 stars
with submillimeter data from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz. We perform linear
fits between the Planck (Qs, Us) and optical (qv, uv) Stokes parameters,
accounting for the differences in resolution between the two datasets as well
as the distribution of clouds along the line of sight. We find that in this
region of the sky the Rp/p value is 3.67 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1, indicating a
significantly shallower slope than that found previously using different
stellar samples. We also find significant differences in the fitted slopes when
fitting the Qs-qv and Us-uv data separately. We explore two explanations using
mock data: miscalibration of polarization angle and variations in Rp/p along
the line of sight due to multiple clouds. We show that the former can produce
differences in the correlations of Qs-qv and Us-uv, but large miscalibration
angles would be needed to reproduce the magnitude of the observed differences.
Our simulations favor the interpretation that Rp/p differs between the two
dominant clouds that overlap on the sky in this region. The difference in Rp/p
suggests that the two clouds may have distinct dust polarimetric properties.
With knowledge from the tomographic decomposition of the stellar polarization,
we find that one cloud appears to dominate the correlation of Us-uv, while both
clouds contribute to the correlation of the Qs-qv data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14464v1" target="_blank"><h2>Built-in precision: Improving cluster cosmology through the

equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\Omega_M$ from using
clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal

improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three
cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed
priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable
relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i)
there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For
current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the
addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy
equation of state, $\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\pm
0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering
information is more important for the matter density, with $\sigma(\Omega_M)$
reduced by factors of $1.068 \pm 007$ to $1.145 \pm 0.012$. The improvement in
$w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after
tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For
weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the
cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \pm 0.041$ and
$1.340 \pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the
anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys,
self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent
cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable

Compared with standard GRB galaxies, its faintness, compact size and color

argue that the GRB and its galaxy G$^*$ reside within the group. Their peculiar

ashes. We present a systematic study of the sensitivity of XRB models to
uncertainties in charged-particle-induced reaction rates across a broad
parameter space of accretion rates and fuel compositions in low-mass X-ray
binaries. The study proceeds in two stages: ignition conditions are first
determined with a semi-analytic framework coupled to a full reaction network,
followed by a sensitivity analysis using the ONEZONE model with individual rate
variations. We identify 41 reactions that alter the burst light curve and 187
that significantly impact final abundances. Reactions on bottleneck isotopes in
the alpha-p- and rp-process paths strongly affect both observables, while most
(p, gamma) reactions on medium-mass (A > 32) and heavy-mass (A > 55) nuclei
influence only the final composition. Medium-mass cases dominate in He-rich
bursts, where the reaction flow terminates earlier, while heavy-mass cases
appear in mixed H and He bursts with extended rp-process paths reaching A ~

consequences for the mechanism of ignition of carbon superbursts. Our results

testing dark matter models at small scale and, in particular, the ultralight
dark matter (ULDM) class of models. Within the framework of self-interacting
bosonic dark matter, we use the observed velocity-dispersion pro- files of
seven dwarf spheroidal galaxies to constrain the parameters of ULDM. In our
modeling, we account for the impact of the baryonic component on the velocity
dispersion and ULDM halo structure. We find that in the regime of repulsively
interacting ULDM, the self-interaction, which fits the observations, is almost
negligible, consistent with non-interacting ULDM with a boson mass of
approximately 1.6*10^(-22) eV. In contrast, for attractively interacting ULDM,
the best fit corre- sponds to a smaller boson mass of about 1.3*10^(-22) eV,
with self-interaction playing a significant role in shaping the dark-matter
halo and thereby influencing the interpretation of observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15033v1" target="_blank"><h2>Taming the plunge: A circularization trap of supermassive black hole

Abstract abridged</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole
binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial
merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear
discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently
extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial
eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D
analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening.
We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression
of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$):
migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates
$\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy,
$\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$),
eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e
\approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to
quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and
turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and
employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity
distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping,
the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium
eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear.
Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This
circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational
wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger
timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar
relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in
cosmological frameworks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15054v1" target="_blank"><h2>Implications of a high growth index on the variation of $G$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ícaro.

Batista</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A recent determination of the growth index indicates a value significantly
higher than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting that alternative scenarios
to $\Lambda$CDM may be required. In this work, we investigate whether a
time-varying Newton's constant, $G_N$, can account for such a high growth
index, $\gamma=0.063\pm0.025$. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we study
two parameterizations of the effective gravitational coupling, $G_{\rm eff}$,
one based on a Taylor expansion and another linked to the energy density
parameter of Dark Energy. We constrain the models with Cosmic Chronometers
(CC), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations (data
release 2), CMB priors, and a gaussian likelihood for the growth index. We show
that the constant $\gamma$ approximation is accurate for the parametrization
linked to the energy density parameter of dark energy, but presents a
non-negligible error for the other case, which we treat as a systematic error
in the analysis. We find a $2.4\sigma-3.4\sigma$ tension level with constant
$G_{\rm eff}$, depending on the parametrization. The results indicate that
$G_{\rm eff}<G_N$ around the period of accelerated expansion, corresponding to
a weaker effective gravitational interaction on cosmological scales, which
leads to a suppression of the growth of cosmological structures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14888v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling nonlinear scales for dynamical dark energy cosmologies with
  COLA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  João Rebouças, Victoria Lloyd, Jonathan Gordon, Guilherme Brando, Vivian Miranda</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 7 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Upcoming galaxy surveys will bring a wealth of information about the
clustering of matter, but modeling small-scale structure beyond $\Lambda$CDM
remains computationally challenging. While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to
model the matter power spectrum for $\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions,
it's unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate
models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state,
we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration
(COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model.
We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\Lambda$CDM
emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We
assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum,
finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from
EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a
simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time
(LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter
constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find
our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less
than $0.3\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator's
performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\Lambda$CDM boost can be
employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our
emulator yields a significantly smaller $\Delta\chi^2$ distribution, parameter
constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second
approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally
efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended
cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15465v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disentangling two spectral components in the X-ray emission of the

broadband emission mechanism in blazars. Here, we present a long-term spectral
and temporal analysis of X-ray and optical observations of 1E 0229+200
collected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2008 to 2024,
complemented by hard X-ray observations from the Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array NuSTAR. The blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency, peaked BL
Lac object, known for its exceptionally hard very high-energy (VHE)
$\gamma$-ray spectrum extending up to 10 TeV. In August 2021, NuSTAR observed
the source in a low X-ray state, revealing a concave spectral shape with a
distinct upturn around 25 keV. This feature contrasts with previous
observations performed with NuSTAR and Swift-BAT, which showed no such spectral
upturn. Previous observations of 1ES 0229+200 and broadband SED (spectral
energy distribution) modelling suggest that its X-ray emission extends beyond
100 keV without a significant cutoff. The newly detected spectral upturn may
indicate a transition between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components or
could be linked to photohadronic processes involving high-energy neutrinos. We
discuss the implications of this finding in the context of blazar spectral
energy distributions, particularly the potential existence of a third SED bump
in the kiloelectronvolt to megaelectronvolt range. The observed spectral
features support the hypothesis that 1ES 0229+200 could be a source of
high-energy neutrino emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15835v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on neutrino mass and dark energy agnostic to the sound

dark energy component, which would worsen the Hubble tension, or at a 95\%
credible interval for the summed neutrino mass hardly compatible with neutrino
oscillation experiments. In this context, it is interesting to investigate
constraints on neutrino masses, dark energy and the Hubble parameter that are
agnostic to some aspects of the cosmological model. Here we choose to be
agnostic to the value of the sound horizon at recombination, while sticking to
standard assumptions regarding the time of recombination and the growth of
structures. To be consistent, we also disregard information on the full shape
of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum on sub-degree scale. With such
agnostic and conservative assumptions, we find that: (i) the dark energy
evolution is well constrained by uncalibrated data on angular and luminosity
distances, with a mild preference for dynamical dark energy, independently of
the value of the sound horizon; (ii) large values of the Hubble rate are
favored, $H_0=76.0^{+4.5}_{-4.3}$ km/s/Mpc (68\%CL), together with low values
of the sound horizon, $r_{\rm s}=129.2^{+6.7}_{-8.1}$ Mpc (68\%CL); the SH0ES
value of $H_0$ is thus marginally preferred over the low value returned by the
standard inverse distance ladder analysis; (iii) the cosmological neutrino mass
bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu <1.6$ eV (95\%CL) and becomes well compatible with
the normal and inverted neutrino mass schemes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15049v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gradus.jl: spacetime-agnostic general relativistic ray-tracing for X-ray

and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous
studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic
sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the
21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that
astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy
injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum
star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray
emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when
projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of
accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also
taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that,
depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the
sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial
black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than
current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15818v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of neutrino decays on the Cosmic Neutrino Background anisotropies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nicola Terzaghi, Guillermo Franco Abellán, Fabian Zimmer, Shin'ichiro Ando</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14+6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

invisible neutrino decays impact the C$\nu$B anisotropies, in a framework where
neutrinos decay non-relativistically to dark radiation and lighter neutrinos in
a manner consistent with the measured mass splittings. For this purpose, we
perform the first implementation of such a late-time neutrino decay scenario
within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver, and compute the C$\nu$B angular
power spectra from the Boltzmann hierarchy solutions for a range of lifetimes
and decay channels. We find that neutrino decays leave very strong signatures
on the C$\nu$B angular spectra, about two orders of magnitude larger than on
the CMB angular spectra, particularly for lifetimes comparable to the age of
the Universe. We show that a future polarized tritium target run of the PTOLEMY
experiment, with sufficient counting statistics to measure just the first $\sim

gravitational physics. While pulsar timing arrays reach nHz frequencies and
ground-based interferometers probe the audio band, the regime above the MHz
scale remains essentially untested. We propose a hybrid detection framework in
which gravitons convert to photons via the Gertsenshtein effect in strong
magnetic fields; the resulting electromagnetic signal is resonantly enhanced in
a cavity and read out by atomic quantum sensors. Our approach combines multiple
channels, including long-coherence Raman interferometry in alkali atoms,
microwave Rydberg transitions, photoionization-based detection, and inner-shell
electronic resonances. We derive the graviton-photon conversion probability,
compute the induced photon flux, and estimate the shot-noise-limited spectral
strain noise density. Depending on configuration, the projected
shot-noise-limited sensitivity ranges from $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim
10^{-22}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in conservative microwave implementations to
$\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-37}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in aggressive optical
Raman schemes, potentially surpassing the cosmological bound from Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis for stochastic backgrounds, while coherent bursts remain
unconstrained and detectable. Such reach allows to test scenarios involving
primordial black holes, topological defects, violent phase transitions, and
(p)reheating, motivating advances in high-$Q$ cavities, strong-field magnets,
and quantum-limited atomic sensors, with broad impact across quantum metrology
and fundamental physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14957v1" target="_blank"><h2>Phantom Mirage from Axion Dark Energy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rayne Liu, Yijie Zhu, Wayne Hu, Vivian Miranda</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 14 figures.

recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but
apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts
$0 < z < 1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the
Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$
and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show
that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve
the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension
with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from
$z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions,
raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works
essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB

reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations
provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate
that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would
effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We
also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of
