active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et
al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole
accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD),
$\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$, across $0 < z < 4.25$. MIR luminosity functions
(LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter
and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$, is
derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both
$\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extend to luminosities as low as $10^7 \, L_{\odot}$, two
orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD
peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, $z
\approx 1$--2 for $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$ and the double power law, and $z
\approx 2$--3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN
activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole
formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations,
provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At $z \sim 3$,
$\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR
observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray
observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference
remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples.
These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the
understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24080v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Ly$α$
  Emission $z\sim7.0\mbox{--}8.5$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zuyi Chen, Daniel P. Stark, Charlotte A. Mason, Mengtao Tang, Lily Whitler, Michael W. Topping</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> main text 23 pages, 12 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with {\it JWST} is opening a new window on the sizes
of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations
suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6--1.5 pMpc at $z\simeq 7$, assuming
neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range
$\overline{x}_{\rm HI}$=0.5--0.7. Here we investigate this picture using {\it
JWST} to characterize the environment and Ly$\alpha$ emission of 292 galaxies
at $7.0<z<8.5$ across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of $1.3\times10^6$
Mpc$^3$. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see
overdensities and strong Ly$\alpha$ emission clustered in redshift windows of
d$z=0.04-0.08$ and angular scales of 5--11 arcmin. We detect Ly$\alpha$
emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly$\alpha$ detections,
two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW =
$200_{-78}^{+50}$ A and $284_{-75}^{+56}$ A). We identify 13 significant
(4--11$\times$) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and
NIRSpec. Strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters are almost uniformly found in the
overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the
structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters span
typical line-of-sight distances (d$z\sim 0.14$) and angular scales ($\sim 8$
arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at $z\simeq 7$. We
discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at
$z\simeq 7.0-7.6$, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10
Ly$\alpha$ emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would
pose tension with standard reionization models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23981v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards an observationally motivated AGN dusty torus model -- II. The
  roles of density distribution and chemical composition of the dust</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Omar Ulises Reyes-Amador, Omaira González-Martín, Jacopo Fritz, Maarten Baes, Sundar Srinivasan, Ismael García-Bernete, Donaji Esparza-Arredondo, Marko Stalevski</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Several models of nuclear dust in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been
presented in the literature to determine its physical and geometrical
properties, usually assuming the dust density distribution as the main aspect
producing differences in the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of AGNs. We present a
study of the MIR emission of nearby AGNs by exploring the effects of dust
distribution and chemical composition on the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) using radiative transfer simulations. Our model grid includes smooth,
clumpy, and two-phase dust distributions, combined with two dust compositions:
the interstellar medium (ISM) dust composition including large grains (up to
$\rm{10 \ \mu m}$), and the oxide/silicate-based composition from Reyes-Amador
et al. (2024). A synthetic SED library was generated and analysed both on a
model-to-model basis and with observed MIR spectra from 68 AGNs. We found that
dust density distribution and dust composition significantly influence the
spectral shapes and silicate features at $10$ and $\rm{18 \ \mu m}$, especially
at edge-on orientations. The smooth distribution produces stronger and broader
silicate absorption features, while the clumpy distribution generates stronger
features in emission. The two-phase distributions exhibit intermediate
characteristics depending on the clumpiness fraction ($f_{\text{cl}}$) and
filling factor ($f_{\text{fill}}$). The ISM dust composition with large grains
is more suited to reproduce the observed features and a higher fraction of good
fits, particularly with Type-2 SEDs, independently of dust density
distributions. The Reyes-Amador et al. (2024) composition provides a larger
number of good fits with Type-1 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \leq 0.5$, and with
Type-2 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \geq 0.9$. This work shows that no single dust
distribution or composition reproduces all observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24373v1" target="_blank"><h2>Signatures of Fuzzy Dark Matter Inside Radial Critical Curves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

Kavanagh, Jeremy Lim</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the strong gravitational lensing properties of fuzzy dark
matter (FDM) halos, focusing on the magnification properties near radial
critical curves (CCs). Using simulated lenses we compute magnification maps for
a range of axion masses and halo configurations. We show that FDM produces
enhanced central magnification and secondary CCs that are not easily reproduced
by standard cold dark matter (CDM), even when including subhalos. The strength
and scale of these effects depend primarily on the de~Broglie wavelength,
governed by the axion and halo masses. We find that axion masses in the range
$m_\psi \sim 10^{-22}$--$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in galaxy-mass halos lead to
distinctive magnification distributions. Our results suggest that observations
of highly magnified, compact sources near radial arcs, such as quasars or
supernovae, could serve as a powerful test for the presence of FDM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24408v1" target="_blank"><h2>A White Paper on The Multi-Messenger Science Landscape in India</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Samsuzzaman Afroz, Sanjib Kumar Agarwalla, Dipankar Bhattacharya, Soumya Bhattacharya, Subir Bhattacharyya, Varun Bhalerao, Debanjan Bose, Chinmay Borwanker, Ishwara Chandra C.

Universe such as Gravitational Waves (GWs), Electromagnetic Waves (EMs), Cosmic
Rays (CRs), and Neutrinos offer an opportunity to study from the scale of a
neutron star to cosmological scales over a large cosmic time. At the smallest
scales, we can explore the structure of the neutron star and the different
energetics involved in the transition of a pre-merger neutron star to a
post-merger neutron star. This will open up a window to study the properties of
matter in extreme conditions and a guaranteed discovery space. On the other
hand, at the largest cosmological scales, multi-messenger observations allow us
to study the long-standing problems in physical cosmology related to the Hubble
constant, dark matter, and dark energy by mapping the expansion history of the
Universe using GW sources. Moreover, the multi-messenger studies of
astrophysical systems such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes of
different masses, all the way up to a high redshift Universe, will bring
insightful understanding into the physical processes associated with them that
are inaccessible otherwise. This white paper discusses the key cases in the
domain of multi-messenger astronomy and the role of observatories in India

sub-millimetre interferometry data have mapped the ionised and molecular gas
motions in nearly one thousand galaxies at redshifts $z>0.5$. While these
measurements have revealed a number of key properties about the evolution of
disc structure and kinematics, heterogenous techniques and samples have led to
disparate findings - especially when comparing different dynamical tracers
(e.g., H$\alpha$, [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$], CO). In this paper we present a
literature compilation of 237 disc galaxies with measurements of velocity
dispersion and rotational velocity between $z=0.5-8$, a subset of 63 galaxies
have measurements of molecular gas fractions. We explore the connection between
disc velocity dispersion measurements over 8 Gyrs as traced by multiple phases
with the expectations from Toomre stability models. When sample properties are
taken into account (e.g., stellar mass, tracer) there is little evolution in
disc dispersions between $z\sim1.5-8$, consistent with expectations from model
assumptions. We find ionised gas dispersions are higher by $\sim2\times$ from
molecular gas dispersions at a fixed gas mass. These results are sensitive to
the molecular gas tracer with results from [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] showing
mixed behaviour indicative of its multi-phase origin. The
[C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] kinematics can be reconciled with molecular and ionised
gas tracers when star-formation rates are taken into account.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24175v1" target="_blank"><h2>Photometric redshift estimation for emission line galaxies of DESI
  Legacy Imaging Surveys by CNN-MLP</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shirui Wei, Changhua Li, Yanxia Zhang, Chenzhou Cui, Chao Tang, Jingyi Zhang, Yongheng Zhao, Xuebing Wu, Yihan Tao, Dongwei Fan, Shanshan Li, Yunfei Xu, Maoyuan Huang, Xingyu Yang, Zihan Kang, Jinghang Shi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables, accepted for publication in PASA</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are crucial for cosmological studies,
particularly in understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and the
role of dark energy. ELGs form an essential component of the target catalogue
for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a major astronomical
survey. However, the accurate selection of ELGs for such surveys is challenging
due to the inherent uncertainties in determining their redshifts with
photometric data. In order to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift
estimation for ELGs, we propose a novel approach CNN-MLP that combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This
approach integrates both images and photometric data derived from the DESI
Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10. By leveraging the complementary
strengths of CNNs (for image data processing) and MLPs (for photometric feature
integration), the CNN-MLP model achieves a $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ (normalised
median absolute deviation) of 0.0140 and an outlier fraction of 2.57%. Compared
to other models, CNN-MLP demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy
of ELG photometric redshift estimation, which directly benefits the target
selection process for DESI. In addition, we explore the photometric redshifts
of different galaxy types (Starforming, Starburst, AGN, Broadline).
Furthermore, this approach will contribute to more reliable photometric
redshift estimation in ongoing and future large-scale sky surveys (e.g. LSST,
CSST, Euclid), enhancing the overall efficiency of cosmological research and
galaxy surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24465v1" target="_blank"><h2>Robust Evidence for Dynamical Dark Energy from DESI Galaxy-CMB Lensing
  Cross-Correlation and Geometric Probes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Miguel A. Sabogal, Rafael C. Nunes</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 4 figures. Comments welcome and appreciated</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent analyses joining data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) have provided
strong evidence in favor of dynamical dark energy (DDE) over a simple
cosmological constant. Motivated by these findings, we present new
observational constraints on DDE based on the cross-correlation between DESI
Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) samples and CMB lensing ($\mathrm{CMB}_{\kappa}
\times \mathrm{LRG}$), which effectively probes the impact of cosmological
parameters on the growth of structure at the perturbative level. We demonstrate
that, when combined with geometric measurements such as BAO and SNIa, this
cross-correlation yields compelling statistical evidence for DDE exceeding
$4\sigma$, including within simpler parametrizations such as the $w$CDM model.
Remarkably, this evidence is independent of constraints from primary Planck CMB
anisotropies data. These results highlight the robustness and potential of
Galaxy-CMB lensing cross-correlation as a powerful observational probe of the
dark sector, particularly when used in conjunction with geometric observables.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24395v1" target="_blank"><h2>Correcting for the effects of the point spread function in intra-halo
  light measurements and application to deep Hyper Suprime-Cam data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  L. P. Garate-Nuñez, A. S. G. Robotham, S. Bellstedt, L. J. M. Davies</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 18 figures, submitted to MNRAS May 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The intra-halo light (IHL) is the diffuse stellar component that surrounds
galaxies, groups, and clusters. Its formation is intimately linked to the
hierarchical assembly of the system, making it a key tracer of galaxy
evolution. However, the low surface brightness (LSB) of the IHL makes it
challenging to detect and also to distinguish from the point spread function
(PSF) effect of the telescope. In this paper, we present two independent
techniques that, when combined, provide a statistically robust estimation of
the IHL component in galaxy groups and clusters. The first technique corrects
for the PSF-scattering effect to obtain unbiased LSB measurements, while the
second fits an exponential model to the IHL component using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimiser algorithm. To test our methodology, we build a set
of 5440 Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Data Release 3
(HSC-SSP PDR3) mock observations of Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) groups,
each containing an IHL component with a flux fraction ($\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$)
ranging from 0.01 to 0.5. Our results demonstrate the importance of properly
removing the PSF-scattered flux, especially at lower $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$.
Without the PSF correction, our IHL model overestimates the true flux by up to
a factor of 100, and the effective radius by up to a factor of 10. Finally, we
apply our methodology to real observations and estimate the $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$
of the GAMA group G400138 using HSC-PDR3 UD data in the $\textit{g,r}$ and
$\textit{i}$-bands, finding median IHL fractions of: $\mathrm{f_{g,IHL}}$
$\sim$ 0.19$^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$, $\mathrm{f_{r,IHL}}$ $\sim$
0.08$^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$ and $\mathrm{f_{i,IHL}}$ $\sim$ 0.06$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24711v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dense gas tracers in and between spiral arms: from Giant Molecular

Clark</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages, 26 figures, accepted by MNRAS (30 May 2025)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Giant Molecular Filaments are opportune locations in our Galaxy to study the
star-forming interstellar matter and its accumulation on spatial scales
comparable to those now becoming available for external galaxies. We mapped the
emission of HCN(1$-$0), HCO$^+$(1$-$0), and N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) towards two of
these filaments, one associated with the Sagittarius arm and one with an
interarm area. Using the data alongside the COHRS $^{12}$CO(3$-$2), the CHIMPS
$^{13}$CO(3$-$2), and $\textit{Herschel}$-based column density maps, we
evaluate the dense gas tracer emission characteristics and find that although
its filling factor is the smallest among the studied species, N$_2$H$^+$ is the
best at tracing the truly dense gas. Significant differences can be seen
between the $^{13}$CO, HCN, and $N$(H$_2$)$_{\mathrm{dust}}$ levels of the arm
and interarm, while the N$_2$H$^+$ emission is more uniform regardless of
location, meaning that the observed variations in line ratios like
N$_2$H$^+$/HCN or N$_2$H$^+$/$^{13}$CO are driven by species tracing
moderate-density gas and not the star-forming gas. In many cases, greater
variation in molecular emission and ratios exist between regions inside a
filament than between the arm and interarm environments. The choice of measure
of the dense gas and the available spatial resolution have deep impact on the
multi-scale view of different environments inside a galaxy regarding molecular
emissions, ratios, and thus the estimated star formation activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24543v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting the temperature evolution law of the CMB with gaussian

law governing the evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave

end, we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression techniques to reconstruct the
temperature evolution based on two observational datasets: (i)
CMB-Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster measurements and (ii) CMB-interstellar
medium (ISM) interaction data. Our analysis reveals interesting results that
may suggest potential deviations from the standard temperature-redshift
relation, particularly at low redshifts ($z < 0.5$), where discrepancies up to
$\sim$2$\sigma$ are observed. Additionally, we identify a mild but noteworthy
tension, also at the $\sim$2$\sigma$ level, between our GP inferred value of
the present-day CMB temperature, $T_{\rm CMB}(z=0)$, and the precise direct
measurement from the COBE/FIRAS experiment. We also explore possible
phenomenological implications of our findings, including interpretations
associated with possible variations in fundamental constants, such as the
fine-structure constant $\alpha$, which could provide a physical explanation
for the observed deviations at low redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24522v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical tagging of tidal tail star candidates of NGC 6362</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andrés E.

Accepted for publication in Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The inner Milky Way disk globular cluster NGC~6362 appears to exhibit tidal
tails composed of stars that have proper motions and positions in the
color-magnitude diagram similar to those of cluster stars. Because recent
results seem also to show that these stars are distributed across the regions
least affected by interstellar absorption and reproduce the observed composite
star field density map, we carried out a detailed spectroscopic analysis of a
number of chemical element abundances of tidal tail star candidates in order to
investigate the relationship of them with NGC~6362. From European Southern
Observatory's VLT@FLAMES spectra we found that the red giant branch stars
selected as cluster's tidal tail stars do not have overall metallicities nor
abundances of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Ni and Ba similar to the cluster's ones.
Moreover, they are mainly alike to stars that belong to the Milky Way thick
disk, some of them could be part of the thin disk and a minor percentage could
belong to the Milky Way halo star population. On the other hand, since the
resulting radial velocities do not exhibit a distribution function similar to
that of cluster's stars, we concluded that looking for kinematic properties
similar to those of the cluster would not seem to be an approach for selecting
cluster's tidal tail stars as suitable as previously thought.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24154v1" target="_blank"><h2>Major Mergers Mean Major Offset: Drivers of Intrinsic Scatter in The
  $M_{GCS}-M_h$ Scaling Relation for Massive Elliptical Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Veronika Dornan, William E. Harris</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 7 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work we determine the total globular cluster (GC) counts and globular
cluster system (GCS) total mass estimates for 27 extremely massive elliptical
galaxies. The GC 2D spatial distributions of these galaxies were created from
photometry of HST images using DOLPHOT in the near-IR wavelength range. The
projected radial density profiles of these GCSs were determined using a Voronoi
tessellation-based technique introduced in our previous paper. We then plot
these galaxies on the GCS - halo mass relation alongside previously studied
galaxies in the literature. The relation now extends across seven decades of
halo mass. We find that the 1:1 slope of this relation holds out to the highest
mass galaxies, although extremely massive BCG galaxies are shifted to higher
GCS masses than their lower-mass galaxy counterparts. We find a negative
correlation with massive galaxies' offset from the GCS - halo mass relation and
the steepness of their GCS density profiles, and that this is being driven by
the red GC populations. We suggest that the biggest influence in intrinsic
scatter in the GCS - halo mass relation for massive galaxies is through a few
major mergers resulting in accretion of massive satellites with old, red GC
populations, rather than many accretions of small satellites with younger, blue
GC populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24755v1" target="_blank"><h2>Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies. VIII. Misfits,

Accepted by ApJ. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The galaxy cluster pair 1E2216.0-0401 and 1E2215.7-0404 represents a major
cluster merger in its early stages, a phase that has been scarcely explored in
previous studies. Within this system, both axial and equatorial merger shocks
have been identified. Recent XMM-Newton observations of the southern region of
the cluster pair have increased the total exposure time to approximately 300
ks, enhancing the sensitivity to detect faint shock features in the cluster
outskirts. Through a combined analysis of XMM-Newton and Chandra data,
including both imaging and spectral techniques, a new shock front has been
identified at approximately 2'.3 south of the X-ray brightness peak of 1E2215.
This shock front exhibits a surface brightness ratio of $1.33 \pm 0.07$ and a
temperature ratio of $1.22^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$ in XMM-Newton, consistent with
Chandra results. The Mach number, independently calculated from both the
temperature and surface brightness discontinuities, yields consistent values of
$\mathcal{M} \approx 1.2$ . The age, velocity, and spatial distribution of this

planetary systems begin forming early, during the protostellar phase (< 1 Myr)
when stars accrete most of their mass via infall from the surrounding cloud.
During this era shocks are expected to be ubiquitous around the gaseous
accretion disk due to supersonic infall that strikes the disk. We investigate
the role of shocks using a theoretical and modeling framework we call the shock
twist-angle Keplerian (STAK) disk, connecting the disk and infalling envelope
gas via a shock using general physical principles. Briefly, at the shock,
energy is dissipated while angular momentum is conserved, so that the infalling
gas must change direction sharply, yielding a bend or twist in the streamlines.
The model's pre-shock gas follows free-fall parabolic trajectories, while the
post-shock gas is on lower-energy, elliptical orbits.
  We construct synthetic observations and find that the deviations from
circular Keplerian orbits are detectable in Doppler-shifted molecular spectral
lines using radio interferometers such as ALMA. Specifically, the STAK model
leads to line emission intensity and velocity-moment maps that are asymmetric
and offset with respect to the disk structure traced by the dust continuum. We
examine archival ALMA data for the class 0/I protostar L1527 and find the
C$^{18}$O velocity moment map has features resembling the disk plus envelope
emission that naturally arise when the two are connected by a shock. Thus,
spectral line observations having sub-km/s spectral resolution and angular
resolution sufficient to fully resolve the disk can reveal protostars'
envelope-disk shocks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24591v1" target="_blank"><h2>Diversity of Cold Worlds: A Near Complete Spectral Energy Distribution

Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an
extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954$-$0935066. Spanning from
optical to mid-infrared (0.7--20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this
substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H ($R\sim$2700)
and Magellan FIRE echelle ($R\sim$8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI
mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan,
AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec
G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$,
H$_{2}$S, CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and
5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature
detected mainly at $\sim$ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared
K I doublets in the $R\sim8000$ FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum,
we tentatively identify a new CO$_{2}$ feature at 14--16 micron. The
comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity,
effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise
radial velocity measurement of $47.1\pm1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ for the object, in
agreement with previous measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24841v1" target="_blank"><h2>pySTARBURST99: The Next Generation of STARBURST99</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Calum Hawcroft, Claus Leitherer, Oskar Arangure, John Chisholm, Sylvia Ekstrom, Sebastien Martinet, Lucimara Martins, Georges Meynet, Christophe Morisset, Andreas Sander, Aida Wofford</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJS, 14 pages (50 including appendix), 15 figures (44 including appendix)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> STARBURST99 is a population synthesis code tailored to predict the integrated
properties or observational characteristics of star-forming galaxies. Here we
present an update to STARBURST99 where we port the code to python, include new
evolutionary tracks both rotating and non-rotating at a range of low
metallicity environments. We complement these tracks with a corresponding grid
of new synthetic SEDs. Additionally we include both evolutionary and spectral
models of stars up to 300-500Msol. Synthesis models made with the python
version of the code and new input stellar models are labelled pySTARBURST99. We
make new predictions for many properties, such as ionising flux, SED,
bolometric luminosity, wind power, hydrogen line equivalent widths and the UV
beta-slope. These properties are all assessed over wider coverage in
metallicity, mass and resolution than in previous versions of STARBURST99. A
notable finding from these updates is an increase in H I ionising flux of 0.3
dex in the first 2Myr when increasing the upper mass limit from 120 to 300Msol.
Changing metallicity has little impact on H I in the first 2Myr (range of 0.015
dex from Z = 0.02 to 0.0) but lower metallicities have higher H I by 1 dex
(comparing Z = 0.02 to 0.0004) at later times, with Z = 0.0 having even higher
H I at later times. Rotating models have significantly higher H I than their
equivalent non-rotating models at any time after 2Myr. Similar trends are found
for He I and He II, bolometric luminosity and wind momentum, with more complex
relations found for hydrogen line equivalent widths and UV beta-slopes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24559v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Samples and Binary Fractions of Red Supergiant in M31 and M33 by the
  HST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Min Dai, Shu Wang, Biwei Jiang, Ying Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The binarity of red supergiants (RSGs) influences their evolution and the
fate of supernovae. We investigate the binary fraction of RSGs in the Andromeda
Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33) using photometry from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), which offers high spatial resolution to resolve more RSGs. A
preliminary step involves identifying a reliable and complete RSG sample using
the F110W $-$ F160W versus F160W diagram, yielding 2,612 RSGs from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey of M31 3,294 RSGs from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER)
survey of M33. These samples suggest total RSG populations in M31 and M33 of
6,563 and 7,572, respectively. These estimates significantly exceed previous
ones from the ground-based observations, an increase attributed to the superior
spatial resolution of the HST. The stellar parameters of these RSGs, including
effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$), radius ($R$), and luminosity ($L$),
are derived by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) across optical
and near-infrared bands. Binary candidates are identified by detecting
ultraviolet (UV) excesses in their SEDs compared to the single-star RSG model
prediction. The binary fraction is determined to be 33.4% $\pm$ 0.9% for M31
and 30.9% $\pm$ 0.8% for M33. For more luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} >
4.0$, the binary fraction decreases to 31.6% $\pm$ 1.9% in M31 and increases to
34.7% $\pm$ 1.8% in M33, respectively. These results are in good agreement with
predictions from the BPASS binary evolution model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24789v1" target="_blank"><h2>The effects of the spin and quadrupole moment of SgrA* on the orbits of
  S stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  K. Abd El Dayem, F. H. Vincent, G. Heissel, T. Paumard, G. Perrin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Measuring the astrometric and spectroscopic data of stars orbiting the
central black hole in our galaxy (Sgr A*) offers a promising way to measure
relativistic effects. In principle, the "no-hair" theorem can be tested at the
Galactic Center by monitoring the orbital precession of S-stars due to the
angular momentum (spin) and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*. Closer-in stars, more
strongly affected by the black hole's rotation, may be required. GRAVITY+ could
detect such stars that are currently too faint for GRAVITY. We aim to
analytically and numerically characterize orbital reorientations induced by
spin-related effects of Sgr A* up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order. We
use the two-timescale method to derive the 2PN analytical expressions of the
secular evolution of the orbital parameters that are related to the observer.
To study the interaction between the orbital and spin orientations, we
introduce observer-independent quantities that offer insight into the Kerr
geometry. We also use the post-Newtonian code OOGRE to simulate hypothetical
stars orbiting closer to Sgr A*, where spin and quadrupole effects are
stronger. This enables comparison with our analytical predictions. We exhibit
three orbital-timescale precession rates that encode the in-plane pericenter
shift and the out-of-plane redirection of the osculating ellipse. We provide
the 2PN expressions of these precession rates and express the orbit-integrated
associated angular shifts of the pericenter and of the ellipse axes. We relate
these orbital-timescale precession rates to the secular-timescale precession of
the orbital angular momentum around the black hole spin axis. We consider that
the theoretical insight we provide in this article will be useful in
constraining the spin effect of Sgr A* with GRAVITY+ observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24240v1" target="_blank"><h2>Long-term investigation of an open cluster Berkeley 65</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tarak Chand, Saurabh Sharma, Koshvendra Singh, Jeewan Pandey, Aayushi Verma, Harmeen Kaur, Mamta, Manojit Chakraborty, Devendra K.

65 (Be 65), using deep optical data from the telescopes of ARIES, Nainital
Observatory. We estimate its radius ($R_{cluster}$ = 1.6$^{'}$, aspect ratio of
$\sim$1.1), distance (2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc) and age ($\sim$160 Myrs). A clear
turn-off point at $\sim$1.7 M$_\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape
of low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical
mass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline
optical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars
in this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of
those variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\sim$0.05 days
to $\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\sim$8 mmag to $\sim$700 mmag.
The nonperiodic stars show variation from $\sim$30 mmag to $\sim$500 mmag. The
periodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating
B-type, $\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\gamma$ Doradus. We report a detached
binary system and rotating variables similar to BY Draconis-type stars
exhibiting variable brightness caused by starspots, chromospheric activity, and
magnetic field-related phenomena.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24743v1" target="_blank"><h2>What solves the Hubble tension in phenomenological dark energy models at
  background level?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Manosh T. Manoharan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages. Comments and feedback are greatly appreciated. Currently under journal review</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Few phenomenological models tend to favour higher values of the Hubble
parameter, often at the expense of invoking phantom transitions. These models
achieve this without introducing additional parameters, akin to the simplicity
of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate two such
models -- Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) and Granda-Oliveros
Holographic Dark Energy (GOHDE) -- to assess how correlations between $H_0$ and
$\Omega_m$, as well as the choice of datasets, influence conclusions regarding
their potential to address the Hubble tension at the background level. We find
that minimally extended versions of these models favour notably low values for
the Hubble parameter, with the perceived preference for higher values driven by
the associated prior. Excluding BAO Ly$\alpha$-$H(z)$ data points at a redshift
of $\sim 2.3$ results in a Hubble parameter that remains in significant tension
with SH0ES measurements. In contrast, including these data points favours a
higher $H_0$, as they suggest a relatively lower matter density within the
framework of the assumed fiducial cosmology. Additionally, recent DESI DR1 and
DR2 data exhibit mild tension with BAO-$H(z)$ estimates from SDSS. We
demonstrate that the inclusion of stringent constraints, such as the CMB
shift-parameter along with Pantheon$^+$, on the effective pressure less matter
density significantly impacts the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Finally,
reinterpreting these models in terms of interacting dark sectors with $Q =
3H\gamma_{\Lambda}\tilde{\rho}_{m}$ reveals that addressing the Hubble tension
necessitates a varying $\gamma_{\Lambda}$ characterised by a singular
sign-switch behaviour. This phantom behaviour, or equivalently, the onset of
violation of the null energy condition in the future, is crucial for minimal
models to solve the Hubble tension.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24242v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of the Hybrid Response of Photoionized Gases</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhicheng He, Tinggui Wang, Gary J. Ferland</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, physics.plasm-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 4 figures, accept for publication in The Astrophysical Journal</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Photoionized gases are prevalent throughout the universe. In such gases, the
ion concentration typically exhibits two response modes to radiation: a
positive response in the low-ionization state and a negative response in the
high-ionization state. Here, we report the discovery of a widespread
misalignment at the boundary between the above two response modes, and identify
a third mode-the hybrid response-through time-dependent photoionization
simulations. This phenomenon arises from the asynchrony among the ionization
rate, recombination rate, and ion column density. Among these, only the
ionization rate can respond instantaneously to changes in radiation.
Consequently, the initial rate of change in the column density of \( N_i \) ion
is given by \( -N_i I_i + N_{i-1} I_{i-1} \). However, this quantity is
typically nonzero at the peak of \( N_i \), leading to a misalignment between
the boundaries of positive and negative responses. Such hybrid effects
introduce additional complexity in the interpretation of gas properties,
highlighting the need for further investigation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24093v1" target="_blank"><h2>Very-wide-orbit planets from dynamical instabilities during the stellar

astronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even
the Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet
Nine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects.
However, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use
numerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural
byproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while
their host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is
first brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by
repeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from
nearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the
interaction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events
likely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune,
and the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a
very wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth
cluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the
trapping efficiency is 1-5\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric
orbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24732v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yifu Cai, Xin Ren, Taotao Qiu, Mingzhe Li, Xinmin Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 5 figures,</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by
suggesting that the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy evolves across
$w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. Inspired by this
development, we present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its
theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications as well as
possible extensions. We first trace the historical progression from Einstein's
static cosmological constant to modern dynamical dark energy, summarizing
recent cosmological constraints that favor an evolving $w(z)$ along time. A key
focus is the theoretical no-go theorem for dark energy showing that no single
canonical field or perfect fluid model can smoothly cross the $w = -1$
boundary. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field
models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity
frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these
mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintom fields with ordinary matter and
the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24695v1" target="_blank"><h2>Likelihoods for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Data Analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gabriele Franciolini, Mauro Pieroni, Angelo Ricciardone, Joseph D.

Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) searches. By dividing the data into many
short segments, one customarily takes advantage of the Central Limit Theorem to
justify a Gaussian crosscorrelation likelihood. We show, with a hierarchy of
ever more realistic examples, beginning with a single frequency bin and one
detector, and then moving to two and three detectors with white and colored
signal and noise, that approximating the exact Whittle likelihood by various
Gaussian alternatives can induce systematic biases in the estimation of the
SGWB parameters. We derive several approximations for the full likelihood and
identify regimes where Gaussianity breaks down. We also discuss the possibility
of conditioning the full likelihood on fiducial noise estimates to produce
unbiased SGWB parameter estimation. We show that for some segment durations and
bandwidths, particularly in space-based and pulsar-timing arrays, the bias can
exceed the statistical uncertainty. Our results provide practical guidance for
segment choice, likelihood selection, and data-compression strategies to ensure
robust SGWB inference in current and next-generation gravitational wave
detectors.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24856v1" target="_blank"><h2>The SPHEREx Sky Simulator: Science Data Modeling for the First All-Sky

Evans</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It has long been known that a large population of Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs)
exists in the Milky Way's neighboring dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), due to a recent period of intense star formation. Since 2016, efforts
have been made to monitor this population and identify new BeXRBs through the
Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). S-CUBED's weekly observation cadence has identified
many new BeXRBs that exist within the SMC, but evidence suggests that more
systems exist that have thusfar escaped detection. A major challenge in
identifying new BeXRBs is their transient nature at high-energy wavelengths,
which prevents them from being detected via their X-ray emission
characteristics when not in outburst. In order to identify sources that may
have been missed due to a long period of quiescence, it becomes necessary to
devise methods of detection that rely on wavelengths at which BeXRBs are more
persistent emitters. In this work, we attempt to use archival analysis of
infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations to identify new candidate
BeXRBs that have been overlooked within the S-CUBED source catalog. Using
X-ray/optical selection of source properties, unsupervised clustering,
SED-fitting to VizieR archival measurements, and ultraviolet light curve
analysis, we are able to identify six new candidate BeXRB systems that
otherwise would have been missed by automated analysis pipelines. Using these
results, we demonstrate the use of ultraviolet through near-infrared
observational data in identifying candidate BeXRBs when they cannot be
identified using their X-ray emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24070v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can a Dark Inferno Melt Earth's Core?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Christopher Cappiello, Tansu Daylan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.EP</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Main text: 6 pages, 6 figures. Appendix: 1 page, 2 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The search for dark matter is one of the crucial open problems in both
particle physics and cosmology. If dark matter scatters with Standard Model
particles, it could accumulate inside the Earth and begin to annihilate,
producing heat within the Earth's core. While past work has been done on the
effect that this heat would have once it reached the surface, we model the flow
of heat through the Earth's core by numerically solving the heat equation to
model dark matter's effect on the interior of the planet. We compute how long
it takes for the core to come into thermal equilibrium and show that for a wide
range of dark matter parameters, a substantial fraction of the inner core would
be melted by dark matter annihilation. Our analysis produces new limits on dark
matter annihilating in the Earth, points out important new effects that must be
considered when studying planetary heating by dark matter, and suggests new
dark matter observables that could be searched for in exoplanet populations.</p></br></body>
