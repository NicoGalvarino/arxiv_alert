cycle, which fuels star formation while shaping chemical abundances within
galaxies. Investigating the relationship between star formation and metallicity
for large samples of galaxies requires expensive IFU surveys or sophisticated
tools to analyze grism data. Here we analyze JWST NIRISS slitless grism data
using Sleuth, a tool that forward models and infers spatially resolved physical
properties from grism data, including observations from JWST NIRISS/NIRCam and
future grism data like that from the Roman Space Telescope. Sleuth enables
extraction of high-quality emission line maps from slitless spectra, overcoming
contamination and spatially varying stellar populations, which previously
limited such studies. Utilizing Sleuth with data from the CAnadian NIRISS
Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), we investigated the relationship between
metallicity and star formation in the star-forming clumps of galaxies at 0.6 <
z < 1.35. We analyzed a sample of 20 galaxies, extracted high-quality emission
line maps with Sleuth, and analyzed, in detail, the spatially resolved
properties of star-forming clumps. Using $H\alpha$, [SII], and [SIII] emission
line maps, we examined the spatially resolved metallicities, ionization, and
star formation rates of our sample. Our findings reveal that these star-forming
clumps show lower metallicities ($\sim$ 0.1 dex) than their surrounding
galactic environments, indicating a metallicity dilution of 20 $\%$ within the
clumps' gas. Our analysis indicates that these clumps exhibit intensified star
formation and reduced metallicity, likely due to the inflow of metal-poor gas.
These clumps illustrate the dynamic relationship between star formation and
chemical enrichment within galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01029v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transient LoBALs at high velocities: A Case of Extreme Broad Absorption

(BAL) quasar J115636.82+085628.9 (z(em) = 2.1077), based on five spectra
spanning nearly two decades in the observer's frame. This source exhibits
remarkable variability in both low-ionization (LoBAL: Al III and Mg II) and
high-ionization (HiBAL: C IV and Si IV) absorption features. For the first
time, we detect the emergence and subsequent disappearance of LoBAL troughs at
high velocities (~20,000 kms$^{-1}$), coinciding with the strengthening and
weakening of the corresponding HiBAL absorption. The C IV BAL profile extends
from ~6,700 kms$^{-1}$ to a conservative upper limit of 30,000 kms$^{-1}$ and
is composed of narrow, variable absorption features embedded within a broad,
smooth envelope. Both C IV and Si IV BAL troughs exhibit dramatic equivalent
width (EW) changes, among the most extreme reported to date. Notably, these EW
variations are strongly anti-correlated with continuum flux changes inferred
from optical photometric light curves. We interpret this variability as the
result of a new absorbing flow transiting into our line of sight, increasing
the shielding of a more distant, pre-existing outflow and giving rise to
transient LoBAL absorption. This scenario supports a unified picture in which
LoBAL and HiBAL features arise from similar outflow structures, with observed
differences governed primarily by line-of-sight column densities consistent
with previous findings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01437v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deciphering The Launching of Multi-phase AGN-driven Outflows and Their

supermassive black holes, it is crucial to uncover the role of feeding and
feedback processes from growing black holes (i.e., active galactic nucleus;
AGN) in shaping the cosmic ecosystem. Such studies include understanding the
dynamics of gas flows in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM),
intracluster (ICM), and intergalactic media (IGM). As the output of a sub-group
in Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) AGN Working Group, this Science Case
Development Document (SCDD) proposes to use future HWO observations to solve
the following questions. Which mechanism is dominant in triggering
inflows/outflows through feedback? How is AGN activity triggered, and is it
associated with circumnuclear star formation and what is the overall effect of
AGN feedback on star formation (SF)? In AGN feedback, which mode is more
influential and does AGN feedback operate similarly or differently in the local
universe and at high redshift? To answer these questions, this SCDD proposes to
use potential HWO observations as follows. Resolve and characterize the spatial
distribution of ionized and cold/warm molecular gas, especially those in
inflows/outflows; Explore the spatial coupling and potential stratification of
multi-phase inflows/outflows on different physical scales and their resolved
and global correlations with AGN and/or SF activities; Investigate whether
corresponding outflows/jets induce shocks and/or fluctuations that trigger or
suppress the formation of molecular clouds and hence new stars. Specifically,
HWO's capabilities will enable us to achieve the above scientific goals while
existing facilities lack the required combination of high-throughput
ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) integral field unit (IFU) capabilities
with simultaneously sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01439v1" target="_blank"><h2>Theoretical Diagnostics for the Physical Conditions in Active Galactic

the JWST allows us to observe infrared emission lines that were previously
inaccessible or barely accessible. These emission lines are promising for
evaluating the physical conditions in different galaxies. Based on {\sc
MAPPINGS V} photoionization models, we systematically analyze the dependence of
over 20 mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission lines covered by the Mid-Infrared
Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST on the physical conditions of different galactic
environments, in particular narrow line regions (NLRs) in active galactic

[Ar~{\small V}]7.90,13.10) and neon (i.e., [Ne~{\small V}]14.32,24.32,
[Ne~{\small VI}]7.65) are effective in diagnosing the physical conditions in
AGN. We accordingly propose new prescriptions to constrain the ionization

($\rm 12+log (O/H)$), and gas pressure ($P/k$) in AGN. These new calibrations
are applied to the central regions of six Seyfert galaxies included in the

also discuss the similarity and difference in the calibrations of these

brightness tidal features, providing a new observable connection to dark matter
physics. From imaging of tidal debris, the morphology of stellar streams can be
used to infer the geometry of dark matter halos. In this paper, we develop a
generative approach, X-Stream, which translates stream imaging into constraints
on the radial density profile of dark matter halos--from the inner region out
to the virial radius. Using the GPU-accelerated code streamsculptor, we
generate thousands of stream realizations in trial gravitational potentials and
apply nested sampling with a custom objective function to explore viable
regions of parameter space. We find that multiple stellar streams can be used
to constrain the entire radial density profile of a halo, including both its
inner and outer density slopes. These constraints provide a test for
alternatives to cold dark matter, such as self-interacting dark matter, which
predicts cored density profiles. From cosmological simulations, the outer
density slope is expected to correlate with merger histories though remains
underexplored observationally. With ongoing and upcoming missions such as
Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope, X-Stream will enable detailed mapping of dark matter for thousands
of galaxies across a wide range of redshifts and halo masses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02390v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA REBELS survey: [OIII]$_{88μ\text{m}}$ line scans of

Large Program REBELS (Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey). The
generally high luminosity of [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ and ALMA's Band 7
efficiency motivated its use for line scans of REBELS targets at $z>8$.
Spectral scans of four sources covered 326.4-373.0 GHz ($z=8.10$-9.39),
reaching [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ luminosities of $\mathrm{\sim7.6\times10^8\
L_{\odot}}$ ($5\sigma$) for a FWHM of 400 km s$^{-1}$. No credible lines are
detected for the four targets. For REBELS-04, the non-detection is unexpected
given the $\geq92\%$ coverage of the redshift likelihood distribution and its
estimated SFR of 40 $\text{M}_{\odot}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$. Possible explanations
for the faint [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ emission (assuming a FWHM of 100 km
s$^{-1}$) include high ISM densities ($>n_{\text{crit}} \approx 510\
\text{cm}^{-3}$) and low ionization parameters ($\mathrm{log_{10}\
U_{ion}\lesssim -2.5}$). For REBELS-37, a subsequent detection of
[CII]$_{158\mu \text{m}}$ ($z=7.643$) confirmed it lay outside our scan range.
For REBELS-11 and REBELS-13, it remains unclear if the non-detection is due to
the depth of the line scan or redshift coverage. REBELS-04 and REBELS-37 show
significant ($\geq3.8\sigma$) dust continuum emission in Band 7. If the
photometric redshift of REBELS-04 is accurate, i.e.,
$z_{\mathrm{phot}}=8.57^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ or
$z_{\mathrm{phot}}=8.43^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$ accounting for additional neutral
hydrogen in the circumgalactic medium, REBELS-04 would constitute the most
distant dust-detected galaxy identified with ALMA to date. Additional Band 6
dust observations of REBELS-37 constrain the shape of the far-IR SED, ruling
out cold dust temperatures ($\lesssim28$ K) at $3\sigma$. Further insight into
these galaxies will require spectroscopic redshifts and deeper multi-band dust
observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00988v1" target="_blank"><h2>Challenges to the Two-Infall Scenario by Large Stellar Age Catalogs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Liam O.

distinct populations based on their [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. This
$\alpha$-bimodality is not a universal feature of simulated disk galaxies and
may point to a unique evolutionary history. A popular explanation is the
two-infall scenario, which postulates that two periods of substantial accretion
rates dominate the assembly history of the Galaxy. Thanks to recent advances in
stellar age measurements, we can now compare this model to more direct
measurements of the Galaxy's evolutionary timescales across the disk. We run
multi-zone galactic chemical evolution models with a two-infall-driven star
formation history and compare the results against abundance patterns from
APOGEE DR17, supplemented with stellar ages estimated through multiple methods.
Although the two-infall scenario offers a natural explanation for the
$\alpha$-bimodality, it struggles to explain several features of the
age--abundance structure in the disk. First, our models generically predict a
massive and long-lasting dilution event, but the data show that stellar
metallicity is remarkably constant across much of the lifetime of the disk.
This apparent age-independence places considerable restrictions upon the
two-infall parameter space. Second, most local metal-rich stars in APOGEE have
intermediate ages, yet our models predict these stars should either be very old
or very young. Some of these issues can be mitigated, but not completely
resolved, by pre-enriching the accreted gas to low metallicity. These
restrictions also place limits on the role of merger events in shaping the
chemical evolution of the thin disk.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01596v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identifying Radio Active Galactic Nuclei with Machine Learning and
  Large-Area Surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xu-Liang Fan, Jie Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star forming galaxies (SFGs) are
the primary sources of extragalactic radio sky. But it is difficult to
distinguish the radio emission produced by AGNs from that by SFGs, especially
when the radio sources are faint. Best et al. (2023) classified the radio
sources in LoTSS Deep Fields DR1 through multiwavelength SED fitting. With the
classification results of them, we perform a supervised machine learning to
distinguish radio AGNs and radio SFGs.
  Aims. We aim to provide a supervised classifier to identify radio AGNs, which
can get both high purity and completeness simultaneously, and can easily be
applied to datasets of large-area surveys.
  Methods. The classifications of Best et al. (2023) are used as the true
labels for supervised machine learning. With the cross-matched sample of LoTSS
Deep Fields DR1, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, the features of optical and mid-infrared
magnitude and colors, are applied to train the classifier. The performance of
the classifier is evaluated mainly by the precission, recall and F1 score of
both AGNs and non-AGNs.
  Results. By comparing the performance of six learning algorithms, CatBoost is
chosen to construct the best classifier. The best classifier get precision =
0.974, recall = 0.865 and F1 = 0.916 for AGNs, precision = 0.936, recall =
0.988 and F1 = 0.961 for non-AGNs. After applying our classifier to the
cross-matched sample of LoTSS DR2, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, we obtain a sample of
49716 AGNs and 102261 non-AGNs. The reliability of these classification results
is confirmed by comparing with the spectroscopic classification of SDSS. The
precission and recall of AGN sample can be as high as 94.2% and 92.3%,
respectively. We also train a model to identify radio excess sources. The F1
scores are 0.610 and 0.965 for sources with and without radio excess,
respectively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01372v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Nitrogen-rich AGN Powering a Large Ionizing Bubble at z=8.63</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Takahiro Morishita, Massimo Stiavelli, Charlotte A.

G140H/F070LP observations. We detect broad Ly${\alpha}$ emission (FWHM $= 1540
\pm 260$ km/s) near the systemic velocity, which suggests a large ionizing
bubble considering that the universe is almost fully neutral at the redshift.
Through Ly${\alpha}$ line-shape modeling assuming a Stromgren sphere, we find a
large bubble radius, $R_b = 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ pMpc, and a moderately high
Ly${\alpha}$ escape fraction, $f_{esc} = 11 \pm 3$ %. The intrinsic line width
is inferred to be broad ($2200 \pm 280$ km/s), likely originating in the
broad-line region. Existing data indicate that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is within a mild
overdensity, $\delta = 1.9^{+2.9}_{-0.7}$, suggesting that other galaxies in
its proximity might have contributed to the formation of the bubble. The high N
IV]${\lambda}$1488 / C IV${\lambda}$1548 and N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / O
III]${\lambda}$1661 line ratios measured in existing NIRSpec/PRISM data
indicate nitrogen enrichment in this metal-poor, low-luminosity AGN. The
spectroscopic features are overall similar to other nitrogen-rich galaxies
discovered in the literature, such as GN-z11 and GHZ2/GLASSz12. This suggests
that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 may represent one of the evolutionary phases of those

two contrasting structures: the Ursa Major (UMa) group and the Perseus Pisces

homogenized in resolution for fair comparison. Asymmetries in global profiles
and column density maps are measured using criteria established in
arXiv:2205.00675 and compared to those of mock galaxies presented in the same

HI profiles (33%) compared to UMa (9%). Likewise, 46% of PP galaxies have
morphological HI asymmetries above 0.5 at a threshold of 15 x 10^19 cm^-2,
compared to 13% in UMa. The greater column density sensitivity of the UMa data
enables detection of lopsided features and asymmetry measurement down to 5 x
10^19 cm^-2. We also identify simulated galaxies with unphysical asymmetries
likely caused by unrealistic feedback. In both volumes, stellar and HI
morphological asymmetries are uncorrelated. Global profile and morphological
asymmetries are also found to be uncorrelated, consistent with previous
results.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00976v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Census of Variable Radio Sources at $3\,$GHz</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yjan A. Gordon, Peter S.

recently been discovered. The origin of these features is yet unclear because
their peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of
astrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the
feasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel
for ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final
virial mass of $M_{200}\sim 10^{13}\, \rm M_\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic
zoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive
the X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them
to observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are
agreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass
range, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the
simulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies
in the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic
medium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is
perpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial
direction and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation
channel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs.
However, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for
observed counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be
systematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations
from AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of
the radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only
source term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00991v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disks no more: the morphology of low-mass simulated galaxies in FIREbox</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  José A.

stellar mass range $M_\star=10^{7.5} \rm - 10^{11}~$\msun\, from the FIREbox
cosmological volume. We demonstrate that FIREbox is able to predict a wide
variety of morphologies, spanning from disk-dominated objects to spheroidal
galaxies supported by stellar velocity dispersion. However, the simulations
predict a strong relation between morphology (degree of rotational support) and
stellar mass: galaxies comparable to the Milky Way are often disk-dominated
while the presence of stellar disks mostly vanishes for dwarfs with $M_\star
<10^9 ~$\msun. This defines a ``morphology transition'' regime for galaxies
with $10^9 <M_\star/\rm{M_\odot}< 10^{10}$ in which disks become increasingly
common, but below which disks are rare. We show that burstiness in the star
formation history and the deepening of the gravitational potential strongly
correlate in our simulations with this transition regime, with disks forming in
objects with lower levels of burstiness in the last $\sim 6$ Gyr and halos with
mass $\sim 10^{11} ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and above. While observations support a
transition towards thicker disks in the regime of dwarfs, our results are in

valuable insights into galaxy assembly and dark matter halo properties. This
paper aims to identify a large sample of nearby stellar streams suitable for
detailed modelling and comparison with simulations to enable population-level
constraints on halo properties. We visually inspect and compile a tidal feature
catalogue for $19,387$ galaxies with redshift $z \leq 0.02$ from the Siena
Galaxy Atlas 2020 using original, model, and residual images from the DESI
Legacy Imaging Surveys. Residual images, produced by subtracting models of all
sources, enhance the detectability of faint asymmetries such as tidal features.
We find that $11.9 \pm 0.2\%$ of galaxies host tidal features, more frequently
around early-type than late-type galaxies. The tidal feature fraction increases
with stellar mass, from $2.4 \pm 0.4\%$ at $\sim10^8$M$_\odot$ to $36.5 \pm
1.2\%$ at $\sim 5\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$. From this, we present the first
release of STRRINGS: STReams in Residual Images of Nearby GalaxieS, a subsample
of 35 galaxies with long, narrow streams suitable for modelling. We segment
these streams and derive their geometry, surface brightness, colours, and
stellar masses. The median $g$-band surface brightness is 26.8
mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$, reaching 27.5 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$ for the faintest
stream. Mass ratios are consistent with minor mergers, and we identify five
potential dwarf galaxy progenitors. Our streams are typically longer (median
124 kpc) than the literature, with comparable widths. Stream mass correlates
with length and colour, and wider streams lie at larger galactocentric radii.
STRRINGS will be expanded and used to constrain halo properties in future work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01069v1" target="_blank"><h2>Preliminary census of galaxies in the LISA localisation volume: I.

able to estimate the sky position, luminosity distance (d$_{L}$), chirp mass,
and mass ratio for detected merging massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems.
LISA's uncertainties on these estimates will evolve over time, and enable
electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations as early as a month from
coalescence. In this paper, we create a framework that takes simulated LISA
parameter estimates for sky localisation and d$_{L}$ for a MBHB and performs a
census of matching EM galaxies, or candidate host galaxies. We used this
framework to investigate these parameter estimates for simulated MBHB systems
with masses of $3\times10^{5}$, $3\times10^{6}$, and $1\times10^{7}$M$_{\odot}$
at redshifts of $0.3$ and $0.5$ and used these parameters to select matching
galaxies from archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry. We found
that the number of candidate host galaxies for a simulated MBHB system at a
redshjft of $0.3$ and $1$ hour from coalescence ranged from tens to thousands.
After coalescence, we found that our census numbers dropped to zero for all
systems when considering median constraints most likely due to survey
limitations. For a MBHB with mass $3\times10^{6}$M$_{\odot}$ at $1$ hour from
coalescence, increasing the redshift from $0.3$ to $0.5$ or varying the sky
position within the SDSS footprint resulted in the number of EM counterparts
increasing by approximately a factor of $2$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01127v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting the Proper Motions of M31 and M33 Using Massive Supergiant
  Stars with Gaia DR3</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hao Wu, Yang Huang, Huawei Zhang, Qikang Feng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, Accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), quasar (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The proper motions (PMs) of M31 and M33 are key to understanding the Local
Group's dynamical evolution. However, measurement discrepancies between Gaia
blue and red samples, regarding whether the transverse velocity is remarkable,
introduce significant ambiguity. In this work, we remeasure the systemic PMs of
M31 and M33 using massive supergiant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. Clean disk
tracers are selected via color-color diagrams, with foreground contaminants
removed through kinematic and astrometric cuts. We identify the discrepancy in
M31's blue and red samples as arising from systematic differences between
Gaia's 5-parameter (5p) and 6-parameter (6p) astrometric solutions. The 6p
solution, applied to sources lacking accurate color information, relies on a
pseudo-color approximation, leading to lower precision and larger
uncertainties. Two key limitations of the 6p solution are: 1) degraded
astrometric accuracy for very red sources (GBP - GRP > 2.6); 2) significant PM
zero-point offsets. In our sample, red sources are dominated by the 6p
solution, while blue sources include a substantial fraction of 5p sources; this
mismatch drives the observed discrepancy. By excluding extreme red sources and
calibrating PM zero-points separately for 5p and 6p sources using background
quasars, we reduce the discrepancy, bringing blue and red measurements into
agreement within 1 sigma. We ultimately report the most robust Gaia-based PMs
using high-quality 5p sources. For M31, we obtain ({\mu}_{\alpha}*,
{\mu}_{\delta})_M31 = (45.9 +/- 8.1, -20.5 +/- 6.6) {\mu}as/yr, consistent
with, but more precise than, the HST result. For M33, we find ({\mu}_{\alpha}*,
{\mu}_{\delta})_M33 = (45.3 +/- 9.7, 26.3 +/- 7.3) {\mu}as/yr, agreeing with
VLBA measurement within 1.5 sigma. These results support a first infall
scenario for M33.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01102v1" target="_blank"><h2>The 2025 Release of Cloudy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chamani M. Gunasekera, Peter A.

In this
study, we introduce the {\it Multi-scale Decomposition Reconstruction} method,
an equation-based model designed to derive width maps of interstellar medium
structures and predict their volume density distribution in the plane of the
sky from input column density data. This approach applies the {\it Constrained
Diffusion Algorithm}, based on a simple yet common physical picture: as
molecular clouds evolve to form stars, the density of interstellar medium
increases while their scale decreases. Extensive testing on simulations
confirms that this method accurately predicts volume density with minimal
error. Notably, the equation-based model performs comparably or even more
accurately than the AI-based DDPM model(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Models), which relies on numerous parameters and high computational resources.
Unlike the "black-box" nature of AI, our equation-based model offers full
transparency, making it easier to interpret, debug, and validate. Their
simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency make them
indispensable not only for understanding complex astrophysical phenomena but
also for complementing and enhancing AI-based methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01086v1" target="_blank"><h2>Estimate of Current Mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud from the

conclude that the current mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) within 30
kpc is $4.7$ - $5.1 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We note that the tidal radius of
the LMC of this mass is 16.9 kpc, indicating that our measured mass
approximates the current bound mass of the LMC. Previous measurements of the
LMC mass based on fitting the observed path of the OCS through the Milky Way
(MW) halo reported the total mass of the LMC. We show that because the closest
approach of the LMC to the OCS, where the gravitational perturbation of the
stream path is the highest, is about 20 kpc, the mass of the LMC outside of 30
kpc is not constrained and depends entirely on the assumed radial profile at
large radius. Our best-fit total mass varies between $4.5 \times 10^{10}$ and
$2.2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ or more, depending on the presumed radial
profile of the LMC. We also show that previous measurements of the mass of the
LMC that used a particle-spray method to simulate the path of the OCS suffered
from systematic error because they assumed that all particles were stripped
from the dwarf galaxy at the tidal radius; N-body simulations show that
particles are actually released from a range of distances from the center of
mass of the OCS. In contrast, the choice of MW potential has little effect on
the estimated LMC mass from the OCS.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01017v1" target="_blank"><h2>Viability of generalized $α$-inflation from Planck, ACT, and DESI

of the alpha-attractor and the alpha-Starobinsky model - and examine their
compatibility with current observational data from Planck, ACT DR6, and BAO
measurements from DESI DR2. Our analysis focuses on the reheating phase that
follows inflation, characterized by the equation-of-state parameter omega_re,
the reheating temperature T_re, and the number of e-folds N_re. We use a
semi-analytical approach based on an equation linking inflationary dynamics to
reheating, allowing us to compute the inflaton value at horizon crossing phi_k
and other related cosmological quantities. We consider different decay channels
for the inflaton: gravitational, Yukawa, and scalar. We are particularly
interested in studying these models in the r-n_s and T_re-n_s planes,
especially in regions close to the P-ACT-LB2 combination, which is the area
most distant from the Planck data. To do this, we explore a wide range of
values for the model parameters and show the graphs where the closest

carried out related work; where there is overlap, our results are consistent

software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented
across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual
integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN
(SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface
(GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis
within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a
variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of
unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS
images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction,
continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including
line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population
studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for
full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android,
and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate
SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies. By
offering a flexible, accessible, and well integrated environment, SPAN
simplifies and accelerates the spectral analysis workflow, while maintaining

baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM.
Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of
the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will
illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally
couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the
$w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the
coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the
early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe.
Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The
worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model
are also resolved in our model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01194v1" target="_blank"><h2>Energy-dependent anisotropy of cosmic-ray muons: A twelve-year study

range. Dividing the spectrum at log-scale energy 5 GeV, we contrast low- and
high-energy anisotropy features via sidereal modulation, angular profiles,
Fourier analysis, and full-sky HEALPix mapping. Gaussian and power-law fits to
energy distributions are evaluated using chi-squared, reduced chi-squared, and
Bayesian Information Criterion. Results show strong dipolar and large-scale
anisotropy at low energies, likely due to geomagnetic and atmospheric effects,
while high-energy muons display weaker, more localized structures consistent
with reduced scattering and source-related anisotropy. Energy distributions are
well fit by Gaussians, especially in the 6.5 to 100 bin, validating IceCube's

ground-space fringes at projected baselines extending up to 4.6 Earth

resolution of ~47 {\mu}as. Applying an advanced regularized maximum likelihood
imaging method, we resolved the innermost jet structure with a complex
morphology at a resolution of ~15 {\mu}as (~0.1 pc projected distance). For the
first time, due to a favorable geometrical position of the jet in tandem with
high data quality, we detect multiple sharp bends that form a "ribbon-like" jet
structure that extends down to 1 mas. Two-dimensional Gaussian model-fitting
reveals regions of the jet with brightness temperatures of more than 10^13 K,
indicative of strong Doppler boosting. Polarimetric imaging reveals that the
electric vector position angles are predominantly perpendicular to the
innermost jet direction, implying a dominant poloidal magnetic field component
near the central engine. Complementary multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array
observations at 43 GHz provide a multifrequency view of the jet evolution.
Ridgeline analysis of the 43 GHz data shows significant variations in the jet
position angle from 2014 to 2017, behavior consistent with a rotating helical

radiation mechanisms, including the pp interaction, proton synchrotron

pion decay gamma rays in pp interactions can interpret this feature in the
framework of the one-zone model. With analytical analysis, we prove that proton
synchrotron emission cannot generate a hard spectrum above 0.17~TeV. For
photomeson model, it requires an emission zone compressed near the
