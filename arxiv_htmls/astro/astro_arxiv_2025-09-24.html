  Galaxy Groups</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dimitris Chatzigiannakis, Aurora Simionescu, François Mernier</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract), AGN feedback (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Previous studies of galaxy clusters have focused extensively on the effects
of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the chemical evolution of the
intra-cluster medium (ICM). However, similar studies on the atmospheres of
lower mass systems, such as galaxy groups and giant ellipticals, remain
limited. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the chemical and
multi-temperature structure of the intra-group medium (IGrM), using a subsample
of nearby galaxy groups and ellipticals from the CHEERS catalogue. By comparing
areas with and without AGN feedback related features, such as cavities or
extended radio lobes, we find clear evidence of an excess of multi-phase gas
along the path of recent AGN feedback. However, its distribution exceeds the
length of the radio lobes, since we recover a non-negligible amount of
multi-phase gas at larger radii. In contrast to the clear asymmetry in the
thermal structure, we find no directional enhancement in the distribution of
Fe, with little to no differences in the Fe abundances of the on- and off-lobe
directions. Our analysis suggests that the metals in the IGrM of our targets
are well-mixed and decoupled from the effects of recent AGN feedback, as
indicated by radio-lobes and cavities.</p></br></body>
