\gtrsim 9$ seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral
features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates
suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early
Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow
within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using
cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh
refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington
accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy
co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to
stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium
(ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we
find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star
formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback
if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its
feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of
galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all
simulations in our suite.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18957v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS) X: Molecular gas

and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains
poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure
of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2)
emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies
from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify
clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the
pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio
of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background
smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy
regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative
correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X),
suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas
distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X =
10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes
efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star
formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback
can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18946v1" target="_blank"><h2>The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha emitters as probes of ionized bubble

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), dust (abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how
Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) trace ionized bubble sizes during the Epoch of
Reionization. We generate realistic LAE catalogs by combining accurate
intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ production and intergalactic transmission with an
empirical model for dust absorption and gas outflows. By calibrating to
observationally-constrained Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions, we reproduce the
rapid decline in Ly$\alpha$ visibility toward higher redshifts while revealing
mild tensions in LAE fractions near the end of reionization. Before the
midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles
($\gtrsim 10$ cMpc) have higher observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent
width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical
statistical tracer for bubble size. These correlations weaken as percolation
progresses and the IGM becomes increasingly ionized. In LAE selected samples
with $L_{\text{Ly}\alpha} > 10^{41.5}\ \text{erg s}^{-1}$, Ly$\alpha$
properties correlate with bubble size more strongly than UV magnitude,
especially at $z \gtrsim 7$. This simulation-based framework maps LAE
selections to bubble-size statistics, clarifies biases in more idealized
models, and will supply public catalogs to interpret current and forthcoming
JWST and narrow-band LAE surveys in terms of the evolving topology of
reionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19500v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM mock observations of simulated AGN jets in the core of a galaxy

intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate how the interaction between jets and
the ICM appears in high-resolution X-ray observations using mock X-ray
observations based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We constructed
a model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) similar to Cygnus A (Cyg A), a
powerful FR II radio galaxy. Our simulations model bipolar jets propagating
into a stratified ICM, forming forward shocks and low-density cocoons. Based on
these results, we generate synthetic spectra that incorporate both shocked and
unshocked ICM components. Then, we perform mock observations using the
XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrometer. We focus particularly on viewing angle
effects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening,
observed as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion
occurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is
highest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the
rapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high
temperature and low density. Our results highlight the importance of
considering the temperature and density structure of AGN-driven shocks and
cocoons when interpreting XRISM data. These findings lay the groundwork for
XRISM's observations of AGN jets and will improve our understanding of AGN
feedback processes in galaxy clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18942v1" target="_blank"><h2>Warped Disk Galaxies. II. From the Cosmic Web to the Galactic Warp</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Woong-Bae G. Zee, S. Lyla Jung, Sanjaya Paudel, Suk-Jin Yoon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galactic warps are common in disk galaxies. While often attributed to
galaxy--galaxy tides, a non-spherical dark matter (DM) halo has also been
proposed as a driver of disk warping. We investigate links among warp
morphology, satellite distribution, and large-scale structure using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey catalog of warped disks compiled by Zee et al.\ (2022).
Warps are classified into 244 S and 127 U types, hosting 1,373 and 740
satellites, respectively, and are compared to an unwarped control matched in
stellar mass, redshift, and local density. As an indirect, population-level
proxy for the host halo's shape and orientation, we analyze the stacked spatial
distribution of satellites. Warped hosts show a significant anisotropy: an
excess at $45^{\circ}<\phi < 90^{\circ}$ (measured from the host major axis),
peaking at $P(\phi)\simeq 0.003$, versus nearly isotropic controls. Satellites
of S-type warps preferentially align with the nearest cosmic filament, whereas
those of U-type warps are more often perpendicular. The incidence of warps
increases toward filaments ($r_{\rm fil} < 4,{\rm Mpc},h^{-1}$), while the number
of satellites around warped hosts remains approximately constant with filament
distance, indicating a direct influence of the large-scale environment. We
discuss possible links between galactic warps and the cosmic web, including
anisotropic tidal fields and differences in evolutionary stage.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18727v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational-wave and electromagnetic detections in the context of the

electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2. The
catalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise
ratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent
magnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector
networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter
estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation
ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision,
particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity
strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK
network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW
counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly
from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star
remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small
fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by
third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying
assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity
distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which
introduce notable uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated detection numbers
should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19673v1" target="_blank"><h2>Beyond single tracers: CNN-based inference of galaxy mass profiles from

Macciò</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 9 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (title), feedback (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides
measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using
single-component maps alone. While traditional methods struggle to integrate
multi-tracer data effectively, we test whether deep learning models can
leverage this joint information. We develop a probabilistic convolutional
neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps
from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only,
stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison
of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations
with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar
maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of
$\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN
architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two
components. However, we find limitations in generalizing between simulation
suites, with reduced performance when applying models trained on one suite to
galaxies from another.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18971v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accreted stars and stellar haloes of simulated galaxies in TNG50</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bruno M.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract), haloes (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use the TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the accreted
stellar component and stellar haloes of isolated galaxies spanning a wide range
of masses ($10^8 < M_*/M_\odot < 10^{11}$). We find that stars formed in the main
progenitor (i.e., in-situ stars) typically dominate the inner regions as far as
$\sim$10 half-light radii from the centre, implying that detecting
uncontrovertible evidence for the presence of an accreted stellar halo requires
probing the far outskirts of a galaxy. Stars from accreted, disrupted
satellites (i.e., ex-situ stars) dominate beyond that radius (roughly $25\%$ of
the virial radius, $r_{200}$), which we identify as the inner boundary of the
outer stellar halo. The fraction of accreted stars decreases monotonically with
decreasing galaxy mass, $M_*$, from $\sim$$20\%$ on average in $\sim$$2\times
10^{12}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{11}\, M_\odot$) to $2$-$3\%$ in
$\sim$$2\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{8}\, M_\odot$). The
outer halo has a mass comparable to roughly $10\%$ of all accreted stars. Fewer
than $\sim$$30\%$ of stars in the outer halo are in-situ stars, many of which
originate from star-forming satellites during the late stages of disruption,
especially in low-mass systems. Accreted stars are systematically more metal
poor in less massive systems, which makes the outer haloes of dwarf galaxies a
fertile hunting ground for extremely metal-poor stars. At given galaxy mass,
the more massive stellar haloes are systematically more concentrated (smaller
$R_{\rm eff}$) and have steeper density profiles (larger $n$). Our results
provide a blueprint for interpreting observations of the outskirts of isolated
galaxies in terms of their assembly histories.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19044v1" target="_blank"><h2>The slope and scatter of the star forming main sequence at z~5 :

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), dust (abstract), stellar mass function (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and
stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence
(SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to
masses of $\sim10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers
such as H$\alpha$ emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star
formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316
H$\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\sim4$-$5$ with $\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot) =
6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing
cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the ``All the Little Things'' (ALT)
survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR
$\propto \mathrm{M}_\star^\alpha$, with $\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for
the H$\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the
slope steepens to $\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on
their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes
differ significantly from the slope of $\approx1$ expected from the observed
evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing
the slope to $\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter
with stellar mass (from $\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\star=10^8$ M$_\odot$ to $0.4$
dex at M$_\star=10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). This tension might be explained by a
(combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\alpha$) calibration, a population
of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in
high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify
these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star
formation histories.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18985v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving the Nuclear Environments of Tidal Disruption Event Host

spectroscopic study to date of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies,
with the best observed being the post-starburst (PSB) host of ASASSN-14li. The
stellar population of ASASSN-14li's host, within 44 pc of the nucleus, reveals
a younger recent starburst ($\sim$340 Myr) compared to the population at an
offset radius of 88 pc that excludes the nucleus ($\sim$550 Myr), a radial age
gradient suggesting gas inflows from a minor merger. We estimate a stellar
density of $\sim5900 \pm 800 \, M_\odot / \mathrm{pc}^3$ within 30 pc of the
nucleus of ASASSN-14li's host, exceeding densities expected for nuclear star
clusters. High-ionization ``coronal" emission lines, [Fe VI] $\lambda 5677$,
[Fe VII] $\lambda 6087$, and [Fe X] $\lambda 6375$, are also detected within
the nuclear spectra of the hosts of ASASSN-14li and PTF09ge, importantly
alongside the non-detection of [O III] at the same scale. We similarly do not
detect [O III] in the nuclear region of ASASSN-14ae's host despite its presence
in the SDSS spectrum. The different ionization radiation levels detected at
various radii from TDE host nuclei may indicate echoes of earlier accretion
episodes, including, potentially, a prior TDE. We posit that a minor merger
driving gas inflow to the nucleus could drive the enhanced TDE rates in
post-starburst galaxies, inducing variation in nuclear gas properties and star
formation history on $<$150 pc scales in TDE hosts.</p></br></body>
