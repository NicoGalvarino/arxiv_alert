radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by
gravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black
holes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological,
relying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad
optical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona).
It struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR
radial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability
(line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales
significantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately
eccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal
disruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2
outwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows'
non-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries,
different BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to
the SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at
periapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows,
generating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric
flow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power
spectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose
eccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and
X-ray corona. This model enables detailed anatomy of AGNs and maximises their
potential as cosmological standard candles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08935v1" target="_blank"><h2>The incidence of X-ray AGN and non-AGN galaxies in the far-infrared:

galactic nuclei (AGN) and non-AGN galaxies as a function of stellar mass
(M$_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and specific black hole accretion rate
($\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$), using data from five extragalactic fields (COSMOS,
XMM-LSS, Stripe82, ELAIS-S1, and CDFS-SWIRE). We construct spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) from optical-to-far-IR photometry to derive host galaxy
properties and assess AGN obscuration. X-ray absorption is quantified using the
4XMM-DR11s catalog. Our final sample includes 172,697 non-AGN galaxies (53%
Herschel-detected) and 2,417 X-ray AGN (73% Herschel-detected), with $10 <
log\,[M_*/M_\sun] < 12$ and $0 < z < 2$. X-ray AGN exhibit a relatively flat
far-IR detection rate across stellar mass and specific SFR ($sSFR = SFR /
M_*$), unlike non-AGN galaxies, where detection correlates strongly with SFR.
Among AGN, far-IR detection declines with increasing $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$,
despite rising SFR. Our results suggest X-ray AGN are preferentially found in
gas-rich environments, where star formation and black hole accretion coexist.
Far-IR incidence remains high across all sSFR bins, supporting a scenario in
which AGN feedback regulates, rather than abruptly quenches, star formation.
Comparing AGN and non-AGN SFRs without separating Herschel-detected from
non-detected sources introduces biases. Obscured AGN show ~10% higher far-IR
detection rates than unobscured ones, yet at similar $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$,
unobscured AGN tend to have higher SFR. This may suggest obscured AGN inhabit
dustier systems with moderate star formation contributing to the far-IR. Our
findings support a regulatory AGN feedback mode operating over extended
timescales in gas-rich galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09756v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence for Intrinsic Galaxy Alignments in Ellipticity Autocorrelations
  out to $100 h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$ from SDSS Galaxies with DESI Imaging</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Teppei Okumura</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract), SDSS (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Measuring the autocorrelation of galaxy shapes, the so-called
intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation is important for both cosmology and
understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. However, such
measurements are significantly more challenging than the cross-correlation with
galaxy density (GI correlation) due to the much lower signal-to-noise ratio. In
this paper, we report the first observational evidence for large-scale
intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity autocorrelations, extending
out to $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. From SDSS and SDSS-III BOSS, we analyze over
the redshift range $0.16\leq z\leq 0.70$ luminous red galaxies (LRG), LOWZ and
CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are cross-matched with
high-quality DESI imaging data. By expanding one of the two II correlation
functions, II($-$), in terms of the associated Legendre polynomials, we
effectively isolate the line-of-sight projection effects and enhance the
signal. The resulting correlation for all three samples exhibits a clear
power-law form. We also show that combining the two II correlations, II($+$)
and II($-$), increases the detection significance by $\sim 10\%$, though they
appear equivalent mathematically under the linear alignment model. Importantly,
this measurement opens a new observational window for probing signals uniquely
encoded in shape autocorrelations, such as tensor perturbations from the
gravitational waves. This analysis establishes a practical framework for
probing such effects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08949v1" target="_blank"><h2>SLICE: SPT-CL J0546-5345 -- A prominent strong-lensing cluster at

Due to a combination
of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the
known cluster lenses lie typically at $z_{l}\sim0.2-0.7$, with only a few
prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing
analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift
$z_l=1.07$. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of $M_{200,c} = (7.95 \pm
0.92) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST
imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged
background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the
cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of $\theta_{E}= 18.1 \pm 1.8 ''$
for a source at $z_{s}=3$, and $\theta_{E}= 27.9 \pm 2.8 ''$ for a source at
$z_{s}=9$. The total projected mass within a $200$ kpc radius around the
strong-lensing region is $M( < 200\,\mathrm{kpc}) = (1.9 \pm 0.3) \times
10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting
spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble
Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the
Universe was $\sim 3-4$ Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we
identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like
morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed
spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known
to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08940v1" target="_blank"><h2>Finding Halos in the Lyman-$α$ forest</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Duarte Muñoz Santos, Matthew M.

Submitting to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), CGM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It has been demonstrated that one can track down galaxies in absorption
'hidden' in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest through the use of 'strong, blended
Lyman-$\alpha$' (or SBLA) absorption. Specifically a series of publications
studied SBLA absorption systems with Lyman-$\alpha$ flux transmission, $F_{Ly
\alpha} < 0.25$ on scales of 138 km s$^{-1}$ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). In order to better understand the connection between halos and these
SBLAs, we make use of several million synthetic absorption spectra from the
TNG50 cosmological simulation, at z=2 and z=3. We explore spectra with
SDSS-like resolution in order to understand the nature of SBLAs as defined thus
far, as well as with high resolution (or 'resolved') spectra to generalise and
optimise SBLAs as halo finders. For the SDSS SBLAs, we find that up to 78% of
these absorption systems reside in hlaos, where the stronger the absorption and
the lower the redshift, the higher the probability. We also manage to recover a
mean halo mass of $10^{12.25} M_{\odot}$, in line with what is measured in
observations. For the resolved SBLAs, we expand on the previous definition and
allow the SBLA spectra size to vary between 54 km s$^{-1}$ and 483 km s$^{-1}$.
We find that the largest absorbers have the highest probability of finding
halos. When applying a hierarchical framework, where we allow the largest SBLAs
to consume the smaller ones, we find that the halo mass distributions for each
SBLA spectral size becomes narrower with respect to the non-hierarchical case.
We are also able to probe halo masses from $M_h \approx 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$
(for 100 km s$^{-1}$ SBLAs) to $M_h \approx 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ (for 450 km
s$^{-1}$ SBLAs). With these results, we show that we are able to transform the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest into a powerful halo finding machine for not only
identifying CGM regions, but also estimating their host halo masses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09971v1" target="_blank"><h2>Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): A Census of Star Formation and Cold

history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies
in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts
remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection
criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star
formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive
protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously
selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis
reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass
($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively
star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude
higher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead
of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the
concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster
cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main
sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end.
Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_{\rm
halo}$>8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm
gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main
sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly
concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive
ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the
formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial
gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass
assembly in forming cluster cores.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09142v1" target="_blank"><h2>Magnification bias reveals severe contamination in Hubble Frontier Field

galaxies to be more abundantly detected than in blank fields, thereby allowing
one to construct galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) to an unprecedented depth at
high redshifts. Intriguingly, photometric redshift catalogs (e.g. Shipley et
al. (2018)) constructed from the Hubble Frontier Fields survey display an
excess of z$\gtrsim$4 galaxies in the cluster lensing fields and are not seen
in accompanying blank parallel fields. The observed excess, while maybe a gift
of gravitational lensing, could also be from misidentified low-z contaminants
having similar spectral energy distributions as high-z galaxies. In the latter
case, the contaminants may result in nonphysical turn-ups in UV LFs and/or wash
out faint end turnovers predicted by contender cosmological models to
$\Lambda$CDM. Here, we employ the concept of magnification bias to perform the
first statistical estimation of contamination levels in HFF lensing field
photometric redshift catalogs. To our great worry, while we were able to
reproduce a lower-z lensed sample, it was found $\sim56\%$ of $3.5 < z_{phot} <
5.5$ samples are likely low-z contaminants! Widely adopted Lyman Break
Galaxy-like selection rules in literature may give a 'cleaner' sample
magnification bias-wise but we warn readers the resulting sample would also be
less complete. Individual mitigation of the contaminants is arguably the best
way for the investigation of faint high-z Universe, and this may be made
possible with JWST observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09981v1" target="_blank"><h2>New Insights into Dark Energy from DESI DR2 with CMB and SNIa</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Da-Chun Qiang, Jing-Yi Jia, Hao Wei</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration
suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic
microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples.
In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from
the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining
different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the
$w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its
low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing
measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements
contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast,
combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of
SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of
dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of
improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational
datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological
model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10245v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution and star formation history of NGC300 from a chemical evolution

it produces radial gas inflows as a physical consequence of angular momentum
conservation, since the infalling gas on to the disc at a specific radius has
lower angular momentum than the circular motions of the gas at the point of
impact. NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy
ideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas
inflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical
properties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by
assuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and
outflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the
model. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc
formation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial
profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase
and stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow
velocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day
radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and
metallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas
inflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted
present-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300. It predicts a
significant flattening of the metallicity gradient with cosmic time. We also
find that the model predicted star formation has been more active recently,
indicating that the radial gas inflows may be help to sustain star formation in
local spirals, at least in NGC300.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10518v1" target="_blank"><h2>Very bright, very blue, and very red: JWST CAPERS analysis of highly

the three sources, two of them are a close pair (0.22 - arcsec) of blue
galaxies at $z=9.800\pm0.003$ and $z=9.808\pm0.002$ with UV slopes of
$\beta=-2.87\pm0.15$ and $\beta=-2.46\pm0.10$ respectively, selected from
PRIMER COSMOS NIRCam imaging. We perform spectrophotometric modeling of the
galaxies which suggests extremely young stellar ages and a lack of dust

Lyman continuum escape. In contrast, the third source (selected from CEERS
NIRCam imaging) at $z=9.942\pm0.002$ exhibits a red UV slope with
$\beta=-1.51\pm0.08$. We rule out the possibility of a strong nebular continuum
due to the lack of a Balmer jump and find no evidence to support the presence
of active galactic nucleus continuum due to a lack of strong UV emission lines
and no broad component to H$\gamma$ or H$\beta$. Instead, it is most likely
that the red UV slope is due to dust-reddening ($A_{\rm V}\simeq0.9$) implying
a significant level of dust-obscured star-formation only $\simeq480\, \rm Myr$
after the Big Bang. Under standard assumptions for dust attenuation, EGS-25297

highlights that luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ have a diversity of dust
properties and that spectroscopy of these galaxies is essential to fully
understand star-formation at $z\gtrsim10$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10544v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observational biases on rotation curves from IFU data at cosmic noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Amanda E. de Araujo-Carvalho, Thiago S.

confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxy's outer regions, as their rotation
curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic
noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point,
suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during
earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological
surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation
curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \approx
0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \approx 2.2$. By
comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that
the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$
galaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes
relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more
disturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon
galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when
in reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and
loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised
when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the
gravitational potential of the galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10439v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Complex Multi-Wavelength Morphology of the Peculiar Compact Galaxy

IC 2431, and compare with archival ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio

galaxies. All three galaxies may have active nuclei. One galaxy is classified
as an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible
X-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN.
In optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while
Spitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest
galaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot
gas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and
non-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431
is ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to
the star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio
maps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one
nucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting
galaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the
peculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium
during a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet
that has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal

are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+
rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand
design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with
later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In
addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear
spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the
nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host
galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a
fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the
nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg
structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very
weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate
cases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08929v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ruling out dominant electron scattering in Little Red Dots' Rosetta

exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission, which recent studies propose originates from
scattering off free electrons within an ionized and dense medium embedding the
Broad Line Region (BLR), rather than directly from the BLR itself. This model
suggests that the observed broad lines may be intrinsically narrower than
observed, which would lead to black hole masses that are up to two orders of
magnitude smaller than what inferred when assuming that the whole broad line
comes from the BLR. To test this model, we present a joint analysis of multiple
hydrogen recombination lines in the ''Rosetta Stone''AGN, the brightest known
LRD at $z$=2.26. We show that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Pa$\beta$ have different
spectral profiles, which is inconsistent with the predictions of the simple
electron scattering scenario. Additionally, we test a variety of exponential
models and show that none of them can simultaneously reproduce all three line
profiles with physically plausible parameters. The inadequacy of these models
for the Rosetta Stone implies that the scenario of electron scattering by an
ionized medium surrounding the BLR is not universally applicable to LRDs and
AGN, and therefore provides a counterexample to the claim of a universal and
systematic overestimation of black hole masses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09799v1" target="_blank"><h2>Novel Challenges in Tracking Self-Interacting Dark Matter Subhalos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Demao Kong, Hai-Bo Yu, Ethan O.

structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically
depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time.
In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the
accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations.
These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond
gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo
populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder
Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with
large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking
methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking
technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not
always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter
self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles
to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose
track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse
subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant
fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders
such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on
identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with
large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to
outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude
and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a
hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce
complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10521v1" target="_blank"><h2>Pristine Massive Star Formation Caught at the Break of Cosmic Dawn</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Takahiro Morishita, Zhaoran Liu, Massimo Stiavelli, Tommaso Treu, Pietro Bergamini, Yechi Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to Nature</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The existence of galaxies with no elements such as Oxygen - formed by stars

of the first galaxies in extremely different conditions than those observed
today. JWST has enabled the identification of galaxies all the way to cosmic
times of a few hundred million years. However, no pristine "zero-metallicity"
Population III galaxies have been identified so far. Here, we report the
identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725
("AMORE6"), about one billion years after the Big Bang, observed near the
critical line of a foreground galaxy cluster, and thus multiply imaged and
magnified (mu = 39-78). Publicly available JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless
Spectroscopy (WFSS) spectra consistently detect H$\beta$ at both image
positions, but [O III]4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper
limit on its oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) < 6.0 (1 sigma), or < 0.20% of
solar metallicity. AMORE6 is characterized by low stellar mass (5.6+0.2-0.1 x
10^5 Msun), very blue rest-frame UV spectral slope, and extremely compact
morphology (effective radius re = 4.0+1.4-1.4 pc). These properties are
consistent with massive star formation in a pristine or near-pristine
environment. The finding of such an example at a relatively late time in cosmic
history is surprising. However, regardless of cosmic epoch, the identification
of a potentially pristine object is a key validation of the Big Bang model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09253v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Multi-frequency Study of the Candidate Double-Double Radio Galaxy

galaxy (DDRG) J2349-0003, exhibiting a possible lobe misalignment.
High-resolution uGMRT observations at Bands 3 and 4 reveal a complex radio
morphology featuring a pair of inner and outer lobes, and the radio core, while
the Band 5 image detects the core and the compact components. The positioning
of both pairs of lobes with the central core supports its classification as a
DDRG. Spectral age estimates for the inner and outer lobes indicate two
distinct episodes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity interspaced by a
short quiescent phase. The possible compact steep spectrum nature of the core,
together with its concave spectral curvature, suggests ongoing or recent jet
activity, suggesting the possibility that J2349-0003 may be a candidate
triple-double radio galaxy. With a projected linear size of 1.08 Mpc,
J2349-0003 is classified as a giant radio galaxy (GRG), although its moderate
radio power (~10^24 W/Hz) suggests a sparse surrounding environment. Arm-length
(R_theta) and flux density ratios (R_S) indicates environmental influences on
source symmetry. The observed lobe misalignment and the presence of nearby
galaxies in the optical image suggest that merger-driven processes may have
played a key role in shaping the source's evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08975v1" target="_blank"><h2>Star Formation Histories of Early-type Dwarfs in Group Environment</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hong Bae Ann, Mira Seo, Myoungwon Jeon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for Publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of 983 early-type dwarf
galaxies classified into five morphological subtypes, dS0, dE, dEbc, dSph, and
dEbl,across six environments ranging from the field to rich clusters such as
Ursa Major and Virgo. Using full spectral fitting of SDSS spectra with the
starlight code, we derive detailed SFHs and chemical enrichment patterns. We
find that SFHs are primarily shaped by morphology, with environment playing a
secondary but non-negligible role. Red early-type dwarfs (dS0, dE, dSph)
typically formed most of their stars early and quenched rapidly, whereas blue
early-type dwarfs (dEbc, dEbl) exhibit extended or ongoing star formation and
host extremely metal-poor stars, suggesting continued pristine gas accretion.
Environmental dependence is clearest in low-mass systems: field galaxies often
show prolonged SFHs and delayed enrichment, while Virgo Cluster galaxies tend
to quench earlier and enrich more rapidly. Cumulative SFHs reinforce these
trends, with dSph galaxies showing the earliest quenching and least
environmental dependence, indicating a likely primordial origin. Metallicity
evolution also varies with mass and environment, progressing most slowly in
low-mass field galaxies and most rapidly in high-mass cluster galaxies. Our
results highlight the combined influence of morphology, stellar mass, and
environment on the evolutionary diversity of early-type dwarfs, and suggest
that both internal processes (nature) and external conditions (nurture) are
intricately linked in shaping their star formation and chemical enrichment
histories.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10083v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Snake Filament: A study of polarization and kinematics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Farideh S.

The Snake filament in or close to the Pipe Nebula s neighboring, a prominent
example of such structures, offers an ideal environment to study the interplay
between magnetic fields and gas dynamics in the early stages of star formation.
This study aims to investigate how magnetic fields influence the structure and
dynamics of the Snake filament, using both polarization data and molecular line
observations. Our goal is to understand the role of magnetic fields in shaping
the filamentary structure and explore the kinematics within the filament. We
conducted polarization observations in the optical and near-infrared bands
using the 1.6 m and 60 cm telescopes at the Observatorio do Pico dos
Dias/Laboratorio Nacional de Astrof\isica (OPD/LNA). Molecular line
observations of the C18O and 13CO lines were obtained using the IRAM 30m
telescope. We analyzed the data to characterize polarization and gas properties
within the filament, with a focus on understanding the magnetic field
orientation and its relationship with the filament s structure. Our findings
reveal that the polarization vectors align with the filament s spine,
indicating a magnetic field structure that is predominantly parallel to the
filament at lower-density regions. A velocity gradient along the filament is
observed in both C18O and 13CO lines, with C18O tracing the denser regions of
the gas. The polarization efficiency decreases with increasing visual
extinction, consistent with reduced grain alignment in higher-density regions.
The filament s mass-to-length ratio is below the critical value required for
gravitational collapse, indicating stability.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09743v1" target="_blank"><h2>How homogeneous was the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way 13

the standard model of cosmology. Here we study in detail what contributes to
the cosmic dipoles from CMB, supernova, and galaxy survey in the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, though our theoretical model can be applied beyond the
standard model. While measurements of the cosmic dipoles yield the relative
velocities between the source samples and the observer velocity, the motion of
the observer is the dominant contribution in the conformal Newtonian gauge, and
the intrinsic velocities of the samples fall steeply with increasing redshift
of the sources. Hence the cosmic dipoles of CMB, type-Ia supernovae, and
galaxies should be aligned but can have different amplitudes. We also clarify
several misconceptions that are commonly found in the literature.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09956v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining $σ_8$ with Lensing Statistics in Low and High Density

indicative of rich density structures. However, a more comprehensive test of
the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density
regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around
the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy
two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on
$\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release
of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute
magnitude cut M$<$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$<$z$<$0.28. In doing
so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass
uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of
SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use
the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the
Fourier\_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into
account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\sigma$ detection
for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the
$\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two
point correlation function by 14$\%$. For flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain
$\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the
PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\sigma_{\lg M}$ and
photometric redshift error $\sigma_z$ are constrained to be
$0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are

structures and can provide additional cosmological information complementary to
cosmic shear two-point correlation analyses. They have been applied to
different WL surveys successfully. To further facilitate their high precision
applications, it is very timely to investigate the impacts of different
systematics on WL peak statistics and how to mitigate them. Concerning the
influence from galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs), in this paper, we develop a
theoretical model for WL high peaks taking into account the IA effects. It is
an extension of our previous halo-based model. The IA corrections mainly
include the modification of the lensing profile of clusters of galaxies due to
the alignments of satellite galaxies and the additional shape noise
correlations. We validate our model using simulations with the semi-analytical
galaxy formation. We consider the cases where the satellite galaxies are
averagely radially aligned toward the centers of their host clusters but with
different dispersions $\sigma_{\theta}$. We show that our model works well for
$\sigma_{\theta}>45^{\circ}$. If the IA corrections are not included in the
model, for the Euclid/CSST-like source galaxy distribution and the survey area
of $\sim 1000 deg^2$, the IA induced bias on $S_8$ can reach $\sim 8\sigma$
even for $\sigma_{\theta}=75^{\circ}$. With our model, not only the bias can be
well mitigated, but also we can constrain the satellite IA to the level of {\bf
$\sigma(\sigma_{\theta})\sim \pm 24^{\circ}$} simultaneously from WL high peak
analyses alone using data from such a survey.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09542v1" target="_blank"><h2>Additional Evidence for the Existence of a Primordial Disk System</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shuai Xu, Haibo Yuan, Bowen Huang, Timothy C.

However, prior to the release of the Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra, and large
photometric samples such as SkyMapper, SAGES, J-PLUS and S-PLUS, most studies
have been limited due to their small sample sizes or strong selection effects.
Here, we cross-match photometric metallicities derived from Gaia XP synthetic
photometry and geometric distances from Bailer-Jones et al., and select 12,000
VMP stars (1604 dwarfs and 10,396 giants) with available high-quality
astrometry. After calculating dynamical parameter estimates using
\texttt{AGAMA}, we employ the non-negative matrix factorization technique to
the $v_\phi$ distribution across bins in $Z_{\rm max}$ (the maximum height
above or below the Galactic plane during the stellar orbit). We find three
primary populations of the selected VMP stars: halo, disk system, and the Gaia
Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) structure. The fraction of disk-like stars decreases
with increasing $Z_{\rm max}$ (as expected), although it is still $\sim 20$\%
for stars with $Z_{\rm max}$ $\sim 3 $ kpc. Similar results emerge from the
application of the Hayden criterion, which separates stellar populations on the
basis of their orbital inclination angles relative to the Galactic plane. We
argue that such high fractions of disk-like stars indicate that they are an
independent component, rather than originating solely from Galactic building
blocks or heating by minor mergers. We suggest that most of these VMP stars are
members of the hypothesized ``primordial" disk.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10046v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fast and Accurate Stellar Mass Predictions from Broad-Band Magnitudes

to estimate stellar masses for star-forming galaxies. The model is trained on
broad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths -
generated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with
derived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses
with respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex
over the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's
parameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective
predictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a
strong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to
account for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing
the diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy
distribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally
expensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In
contrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables,
enabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational
cost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in
the data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial
mass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine
learning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its
potential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy
surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09351v1" target="_blank"><h2>Anisotropic Universes in Light of Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jose L. Palacios-Córdoba, J.

model. However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this
assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can
arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of
this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where each spatial
direction evolves at a different rate, and the degree of anisotropy is
quantified by the shear parameter $\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the
present-day value of the shear, $\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical
predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic
models within the Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter
space using the sampler \texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that
$\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a
homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded
at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\Sigma_0| \sim
10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge
the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present
universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a
steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired
scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could
help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional
parameters, making the standard $\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in
most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide
new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework.
These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic
cosmologies to better understand their implications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10101v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparative Study of Structure Formation, Recombination, and

The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of
high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of
observational indicators ranging from near-IR to radio wavelengths. Among them,
the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of their envelope,
$L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the
evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy.
  Aims. We have developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an
end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between
simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of
massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to
the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our
suite of simulations.
  Methods. We perform multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of
RMHD simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into
protostars. We generate synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission
from $70$ to $500\ \mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey and at $24\ \mu$m in
the MIPSGAL survey, which are then used to build the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3$ mm
wavelength in ALMA Band 6 has also been produced for the comparison with
observational data. We have applied observational techniques, commonly employed
by observers, to the synthetic data, in order to derive the corresponding
physical parameters.
  Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law
form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.03}}$. This correlation is
independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of

signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z>15$), using four nights of
observations with the NenuFAR radio interferometer. The limits are derived from
two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of
26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to
minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates
improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting
strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level
radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess
variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At
$z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21} < 4.6
\times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at
$z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21} < 5.0 \times 10^6 \,
\textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest
constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the
limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all
previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic
21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most
extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an
order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A
coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent
across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper
integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal
from the Cosmic Dawn.</p></br></body>
