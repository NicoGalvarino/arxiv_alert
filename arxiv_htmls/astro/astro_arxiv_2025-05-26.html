signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact
signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes.
We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first
star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo
from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of
$3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to
$0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational
collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is
formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the
center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic
contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law
shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$pc.We find that a
piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%,
and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density
profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations
reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the
effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming
velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single
universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the
predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of
magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17377v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quasar Negative Feedback to Surrounding Galaxies Probed with Ly$α$
  Emitters and Continuum-Selected Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuta Suzuki, Yoshiki Matsuoka, Satoshi Kikuta, Hisakazu Uchiyama, Haruka Kusakabe, Masatoshi Imanishi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 4 figures, comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report on the statistical analysis of quasar photoevaporation at
$z\sim2.2$ by comparing the density of surrounding Ly$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs)
and continuum-selected galaxies, based on the imaging data of Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) and CFHT Large Area $U$-band Deep Survey
(CLAUDS). We select 18 quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the HSC
Deep/UltraDeep fields, normalize the LAE/continuum-selected galaxy distribution
around each quasar with the quasar proximity size, stack them, and then measure
the average densities of the galaxies. As a result, we find that the density of
LAEs is $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ lower than that of continuum-selected galaxies
within the quasar proximity region. Within the quasar proximity region, we find
that the LAEs with high Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) are less dense than
those with low EWs at the 3$\sigma$ level and that LAEs with EW of $\gtrsim150$
\AA (rest-frame) are predominantly scarce. Finally, we find that both LAEs and
continuum-selected galaxies have smaller densities when they are closer to
quasars. We argue that the photoevaporation effect is more effective for
smaller dark matter haloes predominantly hosting LAEs, but that it may also
affect larger haloes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17273v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ionization structure and chemical history in isolated H II regions
  of dwarf galaxies with IFU I. The Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A. Andrade, I. Saviane, L. Monaco, M. Gullieuszik</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Paper accepted for publication on A&A. 15 pages, 13 figures, 2 appendix</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Studying metal-poor galaxies is crucial for understanding the physical
mechanisms driving the evolution of galaxies. Most observational works in dwarf
galaxies employ integral field unit data to investigate gas physics in the
entire galaxy body. However, previous studies have not explored the detailed
spatially resolved properties of individual extragalactic HII regions. We study
the only known HII region in the SagDIG dIrr, a metal-poor dwarf galaxy of the
local universe, using VIMOS-IFU/VLT and EFOSC2/NTT archival data. We aim to
probe the structure of the gaseous nebulae to (i) give insights into the
physical processes shaping its gas dynamics, and (ii) relate these mechanisms
to the low gas-phase metallicity content estimated with the direct method. The
H$\beta$ emission line map shows two clumps as a biconic-like structure aligned
across the same axis. The [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, on the other hand, shows a
more symmetric structure. Radial flux density profiles exhibit signatures of
ionized stratification. By comparing the gas structure with the stellar
population in the same region, the young stellar population ($<700$ Myr) are
found closer to the edges of the biconic-like structure. We estimate
12+log(O/H) = $7.23\pm0.04$ dex with the direct method, considering the whole
nebula. Temperature fluctuations are detected, as variations of $T_{e}$ from
$\sim 23400$K to $\sim 22000$K, and oxygen abundances from 7.24$\pm0.05$ to
7.50$\pm0.14$ dex, from the centre to the outskirts, respectively. In addition,
SagDIG is in line with the low-mass end of the MZR. The observed
stratification, the distribution of young MS stars, and the metal-poor content
of the HII region suggest that the evolution of SagDIG seems to be actively
shaped by stellar feedback processes, likely as the result of extragalactic HII
regions being subject to the same gas physics as HII regions of the Milky-Way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17428v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fast inflowing ionized absorber tracing the gas dynamics at sub-parsec
  scale around Mrk 3</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fangzheng Shi, Matteo Guainazzi, Yijun Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) releases energy via radiation,
jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment.
However, the dynamics of accreting gas on sub-parsec scales near the SMBH
remains poorly understood. With high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mrk 3, we
detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and
Fe XXVI absorption lines. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing
absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$ and is decelerating from
$6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over
11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%--$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to
reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling
inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk.
Furthermore, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity
($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected
in the soft X-ray band. It may corresponds to the [O III] biconical outflow in
the narrow-line region. A putative ultra-fast disk wind outside our
line-of-sight, or clouds within the broad-line region, are promising candidates
for decelerating the inflowing absorber.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17403v1" target="_blank"><h2>An ALMA Study of Molecular Complexity in the Hot Core G336.99-00.03 MM1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chunguo Duan, Qian Gou, Tie Liu, Fengwei Xu, Xuefang Xu, Junlin Lan, Ke Wang, Laurent Pagani, Donghui Quan, Junzhi Wang, Xunchuan Liu, Mingwei He</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-mass star formation involves complex processes, with the hot core phase
playing a crucial role in chemical enrichment and the formation of complex
organic molecules. However, molecular inventories in hot cores remain limited.
Using data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming
regions survey (ATOMS), the molecular composition and evolutionary stages of
two distinct millimeter continuum sources in the high-mass star forming region
G336.99-00.03 have been characterized. MM1, with 19 distinct molecular species
detected, along with 8 isotopologues and several vibrationally/torsionally
excited states, has been identified as a hot core. MM2 with only 5 species
identified, was defined as a HII region. Isotopic ratios in MM1 were derived,
with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ranging from 16.0 to 29.2, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O at 47.7,
and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S at 19.2. Molecular abundances in MM1 show strong
agreement with other sources and three-phase warm-up chemical models within an
order of magnitude for most species. Formation pathways of key molecules were
explored, revealing chemical links and reaction networks. This study provides a
detailed molecular inventory of two millimeter continuum sources, shedding
light on the chemical diversity and evolutionary processes in high-mass
star-forming regions. The derived molecular parameters and isotopic ratios
offer benchmarks for astrochemical models, paving the way for further
investigation into the formation and evolution of complex organic molecules
during the hot core phase.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17780v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters --
  VI. Role of external galactic field</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sambaran Banerjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 13 figures. Submitted. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Young massive clusters (YMC) and open clusters (OC) are widely considered as
potential environments for assembling merging binary stellar-remnant black
holes (BBH) via dynamical interactions. However, such moderate mass systems are
susceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host
galaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this
study, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star
clusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95
evolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying
extent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct
N-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for
post-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar
evolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that
even strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH)
core inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system.
The overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of
merger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of
merger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of
the parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped
clusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached
BH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field.
Limitations of the present study and potential future improvements are
discussed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17318v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy-scale lens search in the PEARLS NEP TDF and CEERS JWST fields</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Giovanni Ferrami, Nathan J.

~ 54 arcmin^2 of the PEARLS North-Ecliptic-Pole Time-Domain Field (NEP TDF) and
in the ~ 90 arcmin^2 of CEERS. We perform the search by visual inspection of
NIRCam photometric data, obtaining an initial list of 16 lens candidates. We
down-select this list to 4 high-confidence lens candidates, based on lens
modelling of the image configuration and photometric redshift measurements for
both the source and the deflector. We compare our results to samples of lenses
obtained in ground-based and space-based lens searches and theoretical
expectations. We expect that JWST observations of field galaxies will yield
approximately 1 galaxy scale lens every three to five NIRCam pointings of
comparable depth to these observations (~ 9 arcmin^2 each). This shows that
JWST, compared to other lens searches, can yield an extremely high number of
secure lenses per unit area, with redshift and size distributions complementary
to lens samples obtained from ground-based and wide-area surveys. We estimate
that a single JWST pure-parallel survey of comparable depth could yield $\sim
70$ galaxy scale lenses, with a third of them having z_lens>1 and z_source>3.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17775v1" target="_blank"><h2>Estimating infall times of galaxies around clusters: how accurately can
  it be done with observational data?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Haoran Dou, Heng Yu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 12 figures, accepted by A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context. The environment plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution,
particularly for galaxies infalling into clusters. Accurately estimating the
infall times of galaxies from observations can significantly enhance our
understanding of the environmental effects on galaxy evolution. Aims. This
paper aims to evaluate existing methods for estimating infall times via the
$R-V$ diagram, explore possible strategies to improve accuracy in estimating
infall times, and discuss fundamental limitations. Methods. We utilize a
TNG300-1 simulation and construct the $R-V$ diagram that is directly comparable
to the observations. Using the same dataset, we systematically compare four
commonly used methods, including the projected radii, caustic profiles, and two
discrete methods. A simple linear partition is also considered as a reference.
Results. Each method exhibits distinct characteristics. While the linear
partition slightly outperforms other methods, all methods suffer from limited
accuracy ($\gtrsim 2.6$ Gyr), constrained by the intrinsic dispersion ($2.53$
Gyr) of infall times in the $R-V$ diagram. Given this limit, we explore two
potential approaches that can improve accuracy: (1) the infall time dispersion
is smaller in more dynamically relaxed clusters, and (2) employing two
estimates of infall times instead of one reduces the dispersion to
$\lesssim1.5$ Gyr. We further demonstrate that the intrinsic dispersion
primarily arises from orbital overlap: galaxies in different orbital phases
overlap with each other in the $R-V$ diagram and thus appear indistinguishable.
Conclusions. Orbital overlap fundamentally limits the accuracy of infall time
estimation. The linear partition approach could be a simple and robust
estimation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17334v1" target="_blank"><h2>The phase-space of tailed radio galaxies in massive clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Stefan van der Jagt, Erik Osinga, Reinout J. van Weeren, George K. Miley, Ian D. Roberts, Andrea Botteon, Alessandro Ignesti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 7 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The radio jets of radio galaxies in galaxy clusters are often bent due to the
ram pressure of the intracluster medium. In this paper we start with a
well-defined sample of galaxy clusters and subsequently identifying tailed
radio sources in these known environments. Our sample consists of 81 galaxy
clusters from the Planck ESZ cluster sample. We present a catalogue of 127
extended cluster radio sources, including brightest cluster galaxies, obtained
by visually inspecting Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (1-2 GHz) observations.
We have determined the bending angle of 109 well-structured sources, and
classified them accordingly: 84 narrow-angle tailed sources (NATs), 16
wide-angle tailed sources (WATs), and 9 non-bent radio sources. We find a
negative correlation between the bending angle and the distance to the cluster
centre (impact radius), and we observe that NATs generally have smaller impact
radii than the regular galaxy population and WATs. We present a phase-space
diagram of tailed radio galaxy velocities and impact radii and find that NATs
have a significant excess in the high-velocity and low-impact radius region of
phase space, indicating they undergo the largest amount of ram pressure
bending. We compared the results from our sample with those for jellyfish
galaxies, and suggest that the mechanism responsible for bending the radio
tails is similar to the stripping of gas in jellyfish galaxies, although tailed
radio galaxies are more concentrated in the centre of the phase space. Finally,
we find that NATs and WATs have the same occurrence ratio in merging and
relaxed clusters. However, their distribution in the phase-space is
significantly different. We report an excess of NATs in the high-velocity and
low-impact-radius phase-space region in merging clusters, and an excess of
relaxed clusters in the low-velocity and low-impact-radius region.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17415v1" target="_blank"><h2>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015
  Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yun Wang, Katherine Freese</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11pages, 4 figures. We welcome suggestions for the addition of relevant references</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Planck
cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy
density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state $w_X(z)$ as free
functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at $z=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1,
4/3, 2.33$), and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with
only deviations of 1.2$\sigma$ for $\rho_X(z)$ and 1.9$\sigma$ for $w_X(z)$ at
$z=2/3$. We confirm our earlier finding in Wang & Freese (2006) that $w_X(z)$
is significantly less constrained by data than $\rho_X(z)$.
  Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which
they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a
3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, a finding which is the
consequence of their assuming the parametrization $w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. Our
results indicate that assuming a linear $w_X(z)$ could be misleading and
precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher
redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the
most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy
density varies with time. We have demonstrated that it is of critical
importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from
data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts
will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17843v1" target="_blank"><h2>An improved Seyfert-LINER classification line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT
  diagram</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  PeiZhen Cheng, XingQian Chen, GuiLin Liao, Ying Gu, Qi Zheng, XueGuang Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this manuscript, an improved Seyfert-LINER classification line (= S-L
line) is proposed in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, based on a sample of 47,968
low redshift narrow emission line galaxies from SDSS DR16, motivated by
different S-L lines reported in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram through different
methods. The method proposed by Kewley et al. in 2006 is firstly applied,
however, the method cannot lead to an accepted S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT
diagram. Meanwhile, the S-L lines proposed by Schawinski et al. in 2007 and Cid
Fernandes et al. in 2010 in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram are different from
each other. Therefore, it is meaningful to check which proposed S-L line is
better or to determine an improved one in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram by a new
method. In this manuscript, Seyferts and LINERs that have already been
classified in the [S~{\sc ii}] and/or [O~{\sc i}] BPT diagrams can be
visualized in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, leading the intersection boundary
of the two contour maps to be considered as the S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}]
BPT diagram. Rather than the previously proposed S-L lines, the new S-L line
can lead to more efficient and harmonious classifications of Seyferts and
LINERs, especially in the composite galaxy region, in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT
diagram. Furthermore, based on the discussed S-L lines, the number ratio of
Type-2 Seyferts to Type-2 LINERs differs significantly from that of Type-1
Seyferts to Type-1 LINERs in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, suggesting that
about 90$\%$ of Type-2 LINERs are non-AGN-related objects, true Type-2 AGNs, or
objects exhibiting both Seyfert and LINER characteristics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17301v1" target="_blank"><h2>Confirmation and characterization of Galactic planetary nebulae:

studies, galaxy blending is inevitable and poses a potential primary systematic
uncertainty for upcoming surveys. Current deblenders predominantly rely on
analytical modeling of galaxy profiles, facing limitations due to inflexible
and imprecise models. We present a novel approach using a U-net structured
transformer-based network for deblending astronomical images, which we term the
CAT-deblender. It was trained using both RGB and grz-band images, spanning two
distinct data formats from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS)
database, including galaxies with diverse morphologies. Our method requires
only the approximate central coordinates of each target galaxy, bypassing
assumptions on neighboring source counts. Post-deblending, our RGB images
retain a high signal-to-noise peak, showing superior structural similarity to
ground truth. For multi-band images, the ellipticity of central galaxies and
median reconstruction error for the r-band consistently lie within +/-0.025 to
+/-0.25, revealing minimal pixel residuals. In our comparison focused on flux
recovery, our model shows a mere 1 percent error in magnitude recovery for
quadruply blended galaxies, significantly outperforming SExtractor's higher
error rate of 4.8 percent. By cross-matching with publicly accessible
overlapping galaxy catalogs from the DECaLS database, we successfully deblended
433 overlapping galaxies. Furthermore, we demonstrated effective deblending of
63,733 blended galaxy images randomly selected from the DECaLS database.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17759v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field I: The deepest Herschel image of the

SPIRE instrument and is subsequently one of the deepest imaged fields of the
Universe at far-infrared-submillimetre wavelengths. The SPIRE dark field is
concurrent with the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field used for a similar purpose. The
final Dark Field map is comprised of 141 individual SPIRE observations in Small
Map and Large Map modes defined by a deep inner region approximately 12' in
diameter and a slightly shallower surrounding area of diameter ~30'. The depth
of both regions reach well below the confusion limit of the SPIRE instrument at
250 microns, 350 microns and 500 microns. Two independent processes are used to
extract sources, a standard map based method using the SUSSEXtractor algorithm
and a list driven photometry approach using the XID algorithm with the Spitzer
MIPS 24 microns catalogue as an input prior. The resulting source counts detect
the turnover in the galaxy population with both methods shown to be consistent
with previous results from other Herschel surveys, with the XID process
reaching approximately twice as deep compared to traditional map based
algorithms. Finally, we compare our results with two contemporary galaxy

angular diameter distance $D_{A_l}$ using the product $D^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l)
\cdot D_{A,\Delta t}^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l, z_s)$, where $D^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l)$
is reconstructed via Gaussian Processes from 99 Einstein radius measurements,
and $D_{A,\Delta t}^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l,z_s)$ is the time-delay angular
distance. We also reconstruct the unanchored luminosity distance $H_0 D_L(z_l)$
from supernova data. By using the cosmic distance duality relation validity, we
anchor $D_{A_l}$ and $H_0 D_L(z_l)$ to infer $H_0 = 70.55 \pm 7.44$ km/s/Mpc
(68\% CL). Our result, though not resolving the Hubble tension, offers a

to compare the explosion sites of 10 events to the star-formation distributions
of their host galaxies, and to the sites of different evolved massive stars.
The resulting sample mean value of NCR$_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} = 0.170 \pm 0.076$
is low, while the NCR$_{\mathrm{NUV}}$ distribution is flat with a mean value
of $0.488 \pm 0.084$. The NCR distribution of SN 1994W-like events is
consistent with relatively low-mass red supergiants (RSGs) and, despite the
small sample size, inconsistent with high-mass stars such as luminous blue
variables. To explain the nature of SN 1994W-like transients, interaction
between an expanding ejecta and a relatively massive circumstellar medium is
likely required, with the latter possibly having been produced by a H envelope
ejection via a nuclear flash event, or a luminous red nova (LRN) from a stellar
merger; both channels are consistent with low-mass RSGs suggested by the NCR
results. In this context, we find the early $-26$ d spectrum from light curve
maximum of SN 2003G to share similarities to those of F8-type supergiant stars
and LRNe. Finally, based on late-time HST imaging, we set the deepest limits
for the surviving precursor of SN 2011ht to $M_{\mathrm{F438W}} > -3.8$ and
$M_{\mathrm{F555W}} > -4.0$ mag. This would exclude most supergiants as a
non-terminal progenitor, assuming that such a star is not completely obscured
by newly formed dust.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17886v1" target="_blank"><h2>Influence of cosmic expansion on gravitational waveforms</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tan Liu, Wen-Fan Feng, Zong-Kuan Guo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gravitational waves undergo redshift as they propagate through the expanding
universe, and the redshift may exhibit time-dependent drift. Consequently, for
any isolated gravitational wave sources, the mass parameter $\mathcal{M}$ and
the redshift $z$ exhibit an observational degeneracy, typically manifesting in
the waveform as the redshifted mass $\mathcal{M}(1+z)$. Matching together the
wave propagation and the wave generation solutions, we show that dimensionless
source parameters depending on mass $\mathcal{M}$ can break this degeneracy.
Notably, the postmerger signal from binary neutron stars contains several
dimensionless parameters that satisfy this condition, including the quality
factors of different frequency components and their frequency ratios.
Considering the observations of solely the postmerger signal by the Neutron
star Extreme Matter Observatory or the Einstein Telescope, based on the Fisher
analysis, we find that the redshift can be measured with fractional
uncertainties of $\sim30\%$ for sources at $0.01<z<0.09$. Additionally, we
present a corrected derivation of the waveform phase correction due to the
redshift drift effect, rectifying a sign error in previous studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18085v1" target="_blank"><h2>First astrometric constraints on parity-violation in the gravitational
  wave background</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Santiago Jaraba, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Qiuyue Liang, Meng-Xiang Lin, Mark Trodden</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Astrometry, the precise measurement of stellar positions and velocities,
offers a promising approach to probing the low-frequency stochastic
gravitational wave background (SGWB). Notably, astrometric vector sky maps are
sensitive to parity-violating SGWB signals, which cannot be distinguished using
pulsar timing array observations in an isotropic SGWB. We present the first
astrometric constraints on parity-violating SGWB using quasar catalogs from
Gaia DR3 and VLBA data. By analyzing the $EB$ correlation in the two-point
correlation function of the proper motions of the quasars, we find 2$\sigma$
constraints on the parity-violating SGWB amplitude $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.020
\pm 0.025$ from Gaia DR3 and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.004 \pm 0.010$ from VLBA.
These constraints are valid in the frequency range $4.2 \times 10^{-18}\,{\rm
Hz} < f < 1.1 \times 10^{-8}\,{\rm Hz}$. Although not currently a tight
constraint on theoretical models, this first attempt lays the groundwork for
future investigations using more precise astrometric data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17514v1" target="_blank"><h2>Are single-field models of inflation and PBH production ruled out by ACT
  observations?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Daniel Frolovsky, Sergei V. Ketov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 4 figures, LaTeX</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) imposes stronger
constraints on primordial black hole (PBH) formation in single-field inflation
models than the Planck data. In particular, the updated Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) measurements favor a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, a
positive running $\alpha_s$, and a smaller slow-roll parameter $\eta$. Even in
the absence of PBH production, the updated constraints together place many
single-field models under tension with the CMB data. To explore this tension,
we study PBH formation in an $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We investigate an
impact of bending of the inflaton potential plateau toward reconciling the
model with the new bounds for CMB observables. We find that attempts to
increase $n_s$ by upward bending lead to negative values of $\alpha_s$ that are
disfavored by the new bounds. A possible model-building approach to resolve the
tension is proposed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17522v1" target="_blank"><h2>Influence of Dark Matter on the Formation of Biogenic Elements in Early
  Universe Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  L. Yildiz, D. Kayki, M. F. Ciappina</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 4 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar
nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and
modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark
matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy
injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of
carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional
shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra
that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked
role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos,
offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable
astrophysical signatures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inflaton Dynamics in Higher-Derivative Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sam E. Brady, Katy Clough, Pau Figueras, Áron D. Kovács</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 8 figures, comments welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> During inflation, higher derivative terms in the gravitational action may
play a significant role. Building on new stable formulations of four-derivative
scalar-tensor theories, we study the impact of these corrections in the case
where the inflaton is also the additional scalar degree of freedom of the
modified theory. This case is highly restricted by requiring that in the
homogeneous limit inflation must still work, and that the initial data must be
in the weak coupling limit to respect the validity of the effective theory. In
such cases, the non-linear dynamics of large perturbations are very similar to
the GR case, with the main deviations captured by the terms relating to the
homogeneous Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet contributions. We show that in
principle it is possible to dynamically drive the field out of the
weak-coupling regime from a starting point well within it, but that to do so
one has to finely tune the setup, so such cases are unlikely to occur
generically. This work provides a basis for the study of less restricted models
in future, for example those in which the inflaton and scalar degree of freedom
are independent, or in which one is not restricted to a weakly coupled regime.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17790v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black holes through preheating instabilities in
  $α$-attractor models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Daniel del-Corral, Paolo Gondolo, K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 7 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs)
within the context of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, focusing on the
preheating phase following inflation. During this phase, self-resonance
instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a
quadratic form. PBH formation is analyzed using three criteria: (1) the
perturbation must lie within the instability band, (2) its characteristic
length must exceed the Jeans length, and (3) it must have sufficient time to
collapse based on the estimations of massive scalar field spherical collapse in
Einstein-de Sitter universe. Based on these criteria, we calculate the PBH mass
fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms.
Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance
during preheating, as it neglects nonspherical effects. In contrast, the KP
formalism yields more realistic predictions by incorporating such effects. We
provide a detailed comparison with observational constraints from evaporating
PBHs. Notably, the PS formalism is excluded by these constraints, which are
based on Hawking radiation, while the KP formalism remains viable. These
findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonspherical effects and
accurate collapse dynamics in studies of PBH formation during preheating.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17824v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational waves from strong first order phase transitions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  José Correia, Mark Hindmarsh, Kari Rummukainen, David J. Weir</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 10 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study gravitational wave production at strong first order phase
transitions, with large-scale, long-running simulations of a system with a
scalar order parameter and a relativistic fluid. One transition proceeds by
detonations with asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.92$ and transition
strength $\alpha_n=0.67$, and the other by deflagrations, with a nominal
asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.44$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.5$.
We investigate in detail the power spectra of velocity and shear stress and -
for the first time in a phase transition simulation - their time decorrelation,
which is essential for the understanding of gravitational wave production. In
the detonation, the decorrelation speed is larger than the sound speed over a
wide range of wavenumbers in the inertial range, supporting a visual impression
of a flow dominated by supersonic shocks. Vortical modes do not contribute
greatly to the produced gravitational wave power spectra even in the
deflagration, where they dominate over a range of wavenumbers. In both cases,
we observe dissipation of kinetic energy by acoustic turbulence, and in the
case of the detonation an accompanying growth in the integral scale of the
flow. The gravitational wave power approaches a constant with a power law in
time, from which can be derived a gravitational wave production efficiency. For
both cases this is approximately $\tilde{\Omega}^\infty_\text{gw} \simeq
0.017$, even though they have quite different kinetic energy densities. The
corresponding fractional density in gravitational radiation today, normalised
by the square of the mean bubble spacing in Hubble units, for flows which decay
in much less than a Hubble time, is $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n}
R_*)^2=(4.8\pm1.1)\times 10^{-8}$ for the detonation, and
$\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(1.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{-8}$ for the
deflagration.</p></br></body>
