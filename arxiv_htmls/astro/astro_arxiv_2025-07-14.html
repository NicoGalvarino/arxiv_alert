  affect star formation in the EAGLE simulation?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Apashanka Das, Biswajit Pandey</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 1 table, 7 figures, comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the
universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and
mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its
influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment
remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star
formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample
matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven
environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the
difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched
controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of
AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit
enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the
trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population.
Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos,
consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear
in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally
trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN
feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such
models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings
demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting
neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent
manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often
overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale
structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale
environmental regulation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08298v1" target="_blank"><h2>Obscured and unobscured X-ray AGNs I: Host galaxy properties</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Carlos G.

influencing the observational properties of their host galaxies. We investigate
the host galaxy properties of X-ray selected AGNs, focusing on differences
between obscured and unobscured AGNs, and between
high-(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$}$>$0.5) and low-excitation sources
(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$$<$0.5). We selected a sample of AGNs from the
spectroscopic zCOSMOS survey with 0.5 $< zsp <$ 0.9 based on the
Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagram and X-ray emission. AGNs were classified as
obscured or unobscured using hydrogen column density, and as high- or
low-excitation based on the [OIII]5007/H$\beta$ ratio. We analysed various AGN
properties, including the hardness ratio, X-ray luminosity, emission line
ratios such as the ionisation-level sensitive parameter
O32=log([OIII]5007/[OII]3727), and the metallicity sensitive parameter
R23=log(([OIII]5007+[OII]3727/H$\beta$), and the specific black hole accretion
rate. Unobscured AGNs exhibit a more evident correlation between the
[OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ionisation ratio and X-ray luminosity than obscured AGNs,
while high-excitation obscured AGNs reach, on average, higher X-ray
luminosities. Furthermore, high-excitation AGNs typically show high values of
R23, suggesting low metallicities, similar to that observed in high-redshift
galaxies (4 $< z <$ 6). We find a positive correlation between the parameters
$\lambda$sBHAR and N$_H$, R23 and O32 parameters. The correlation suggests that
AGNs with a high specific accretion rate have not only a higher production of
high-energy photons, which ionise the surrounding medium more intensely, but
are also usually associated with environments less enriched in heavy elements.
These results provide insights into the complex interplay between AGN activity,
host galaxy properties, and the role of obscuration in shaping galaxy
evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08245v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JWST Spectroscopic Properties of Galaxies at $z=9-14$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mengtao Tang, Daniel P.

Topping</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 38 pages, 14 figures, submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), dust (abstract), ISM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We characterize the JWST spectra of $61$ galaxies at $z=9-14$, including $30$
newly-confirmed galaxies. We directly compare the $z>9$ spectroscopic
properties against $401$ galaxies at $6 < z < 9$, with the goal of identifying
evolution in the star formation histories and ISM. We measure rest-UV emission
line properties and UV continuum slopes, while also investigating the
rest-optical emission lines for the subset of galaxies at $9.0 < z < 9.6$. With
these spectra, we constrain the stellar masses, specific star formation rates,
dust attenuation, and the average metallicity and abundance pattern of $z>9$
galaxies. Our dataset indicates that the emission lines undergo a marked change
at $z>9$, with extremely large CIII], H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$ EWs becoming
$2-3\times$ more common at $z>9$ relative to $6 < z < 9$. Using the spectra, we
infer the distribution of SFRs on short (SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$) and medium
(SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$) timescales, finding that rapid SFR upturns (large
SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$ ratios) are significantly more likely
among $z>9$ galaxies. These results may reflect a larger dispersion in UV
luminosity at fixed halo mass and larger baryon accretion rates at $z>9$,
although other physical effects may also contribute. We suggest that the shift
in star formation conditions explains the prevalence of extreme nebular spectra
that have been detected at $z>9$, with hard ionizing sources and
nitrogen-enhancements becoming more typical at the highest redshifts. Finally,
we identify five $z>9$ spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with red UV colors
($\beta\gtrsim-1.5$), either revealing a small population with moderate dust
attenuation ($\tau_V=0.23-0.35$) or very high density nebular-dominated
galaxies with hot stellar populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08561v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing Missing Baryons in the Cosmic Filaments with tSZ and CMB-Lensing

stacking approximately 31,300 filaments across the northern and southern SDSS
sky regions using Planck Compton-$y$ and CMB lensing maps. Filaments are
identified using the DisPerSE algorithm applied to the SDSS LOWZ-CMASS galaxy
samples, selecting structures with lengths between 30-100 cMpc and redshifts in
the range $0.2 < z < 0.6$. Radial profiles are extracted out to 25 cMpc from
the filament spines, and galaxy clusters with halo masses above $3 \times
10^{13}$ solar masses are masked to reduce contamination. We detect the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal at $7.82\sigma$ and the CMB lensing signal at
$7.78\sigma$. The stacked profiles are corrected by a geometric bias related to
filament inclination with respect to the line of sight, and modeled assuming
isothermal, cylindrically symmetric gas distributions. We explore different gas
and matter density distributions, focusing on $\beta$-models with $(\alpha,
\beta) = (2, 2/3)$ or $(1, 1)$. By jointly fitting the Compton-$y$ and lensing
convergence profiles, we constrain the central electron overdensity and
temperature to be $\delta = 5.90^{+4.18}_{-1.98}$ and $T_e =
2.71^{+0.63}_{-0.51} \times 10^6$ K for the standard $\beta$-model. These
results suggest that the filamentary WHIM in our selected long filaments
contributes a significant baryon fraction of $0.124^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \times$
{\Omega}_b to the cosmic baryon budget.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08098v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Discovery of Warm Dust in the Circumgalactic Medium of the Makani

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out to ~ 35 kpc in the Makani Galaxy, a compact
massive galaxy with a record-breaking 100-kpc scale starburst-driven wind at
redshift z = 0.459. The NIRCam and MIRI observations with JWST take advantage
of a coincidental match between the PAH spectral features at 3.3, 7.7, and
(11.3 + 12.2) microns in Makani and the bandpasses of the MIRI and NIRCam
filters. The warm dust is not only detected in the cool-gas tracers of the
galactic wind associated with the more recent (7 Myr) starburst episode, but
also in the outer warm-ionized gas wind produced by the older (0.4 Gyr)
episode. The presence of PAHs in the outer wind indicates that the PAHs have
survived the long (R/v ~ 10^8 yrs) journey to the halo despite the harsh
environment of the galactic wind. The measured F1800W/F1130W flux ratios in the
unresolved nucleus, inner halo (R = 10 - 20 kpc), and outer halo (R = 20 - 35
kpc), tracers of the PAH (11.3 + 12.2)/7.7 ratios, indicate decreasing
starlight intensity incident on the PAHs, decreasing PAH sizes, and increasing
PAH ionization fractions with increasing distance from the nucleus. These data
provide the strongest evidence to date that the ejected dust of galactic winds
survives the long journey to the CGM, but is eroded along the way.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08633v1" target="_blank"><h2>Metal-THINGS: gas metallicity gradients in nearby galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Guillermo Valé, Maritza A.

galaxies using new Integral Field Spectroscopy observations from the
Metal-THINGS survey. We derive and study the resolved diffuse ionised gas
content, Baldwin, Phillips and Terlevich diagrams and gas metallicities for our
entire sample, at spatial resolutions of 40-300 pc. Gas metallicity gradients
are studied as a function of the galaxy's stellar mass, H I gas fraction,
diffuse ionised gas content, and using different parametric length scales for
normalisation. The metallicity gradients are analysed using Bayesian statistics
based on data from the Metal-THINGS survey. Bayesian MCMC models are developed
to explore how metallicity gradients vary with a galaxy's mass and how they
correlate with properties such as the stellar mass or the atomic gas fraction.
For our sample, we find that the metallicity typically decreases with galactic
radius, consistent with inside-out galaxy growth. We find a trend dependent on
the stellar mass, with a break at log(M_star/M_sun)=9.5, and another between
the metallicity gradients and the atomic gas fraction (f_g,HI) of a galaxy at
fg,HI=0.75, indicating relatively shallower gradients for lower gas fractions.
We find that normalisation using NUV-band effective radii are preferable for
galaxies with a higher atomic gas content and lower stellar masses, while
r-band radii are better suited for those with lower atomic gas fractions and
more massive ones. Our results highlight a strong connection between gas
content, stellar mass, and metallicity gradients. The breaks at
log(M_star/M_sun)=9.5 and fg,HI=0.75 mark shifts in chemical enrichment
behaviour, with low-mass galaxies showing greater sensitivity to gas processes.
Overall, this points to gas accretion and removal as key drivers of chemical
evolution in low-mass systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08084v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reverberation Mapping Data of NGC 5548 Imply a Multicomponent Broad-Line

galactic nuclei which allow us to measure supermassive black hole masses as
well as constrain the geometry and kinematics of the emitting gas, with the
most precise measurements requiring a degree of modeling. Two popular models of
the broad-line region describe the emitting gas as either a distribution of
puffed up clouds or a thin disk with strong velocity gradients. As we show in
this work, key features in the reverberation mapping dataset obtained by the
AGN STORM team in NGC 5548 cannot be accounted for by either simple model. In
several emission lines the observed broad-line profile has a single peak yet
the delay profile has a distinct double peak, strongly motivating a BLR with
emission from multiple components. We demonstrate a few possibilities that may
alleviate the tension and better represent the true nature of the broad-line
emitting gas in NGC 5548 and beyond.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08126v1" target="_blank"><h2>SILCC -- IX.

star-forming galactic interstellar medium (ISM) as well as ionising
luminosities, wind strengths, and lifetimes of massive stars. To investigate
its impact, we conduct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ISM using the
FLASH code as part of the SILCC project. The simulations assume a gas surface
density of 10 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and span metallicities from 1/50 Z$_\odot$ to
1 Z$_\odot$. We include non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry, a space- and
time-variable far-UV background and cosmic ray ionisation rate, metal-dependent
stellar tracks, the formation of HII regions, stellar winds, type II
supernovae, and cosmic ray injection and transport. With the metallicity
decreasing over the investigated range, the star formation rate decreases by
more than a factor of ten, the mass fraction of cold gas decreases from 60% to
2.3%, while the volume filling fraction of the warm gas increases from 20% to
80%. Furthermore, the fraction of H$_\mathrm{2}$ in the densest regions drops
by a factor of four, and the dense ISM fragments into approximately five times
fewer structures at the lowest metallicity. Outflow mass loading factors remain
largely unchanged, with values close to unity, except for a significant decline
at the lowest metallicity. Including the major processes that regulate ISM
properties, this study highlights the strong impact of gas phase metallicity on
the star-forming ISM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08077v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear

(~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the
context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE)
program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from
JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the
warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm
molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow
the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas
displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP):
low-IP species (< 25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV)
trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow
cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in
the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike
optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the
nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the
ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of
(750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining
advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain
intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified
classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN
reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR,
disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust
estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08179v1" target="_blank"><h2>BASS XLVIII: [Ne v] λ3427 Emission in Powerful Nearby Active

in a sample of over 340 ultrahard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) drawn from the BASS project. The analysis includes measurements in
individual and stacked spectra, and considers several key AGN properties such
as X-ray luminosity, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratios, and
line-of-sight column density. The [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line is robustly
detected in ~43% (146/341) of the AGN in our sample, with no significant trends
between the detection rate and key AGN/SMBH properties. In particular, the
detection rate remains high even at the highest levels of obscuration (>70% for
log[N_H/cm^-2] > 23). On the other hand, even some of our highest
signal-to-noise spectra (S/N > 50) lack a robust [Ne v] detection. The typical
(median) scaling ratios between [Ne v] line emission and (ultra-)hard X-ray
emission in our sample are log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75 and log L[Ne
v]/L(2-10 keV) = -3.36. The scatter on these scaling ratios, of ~0.5 dex, is
comparable to, and indeed smaller than, what is found for other commonly used
tracers of AGN radiative outputs (e.g., [O III] $\lambda$5007). Otherwise, we
find no significant relations between the (relative) strength of [Ne v] and the
basic AGN/SMBH properties under study, in contrast with simple expectations
from models of SMBH accretion flows. Our results reaffirm the usability of [Ne
v] as an AGN tracer even in highly obscured systems, including dual AGN and
high redshift sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08787v1" target="_blank"><h2>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Mystery N/O more -- uncovering the origin of

in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations. We find that smoothly curved gas-phase and
stellar mass-metallicity relations (MZR) are already in place at $z\approx12$
and evolve slowly ($\sim$0.2 dex increase for gas, $\sim$0.4 dex increase for
stars at a fixed stellar mass) down to $z=3$, governed largely by the
efficiency with which galaxies retain their metals, rather than gas fraction.
The canonical fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) survives in stars but
breaks down and inverts for gas in low-mass galaxies
($M_\ast\lesssim10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) due to regular dilution by
low-metallicity gas inflow. We find broad agreement of gas-phase N/O, Fe/O, and
C/O with high-redshift observations, including the presence of nitrogen-rich
galaxies (NRGs; $\log(\mathrm{N/O}) > -0.6$) without the need for exotic yields
in our chemical network. Instead, bursty star formation naturally generates
order-of-magnitude excursions in N/O on $\lesssim$100 Myr timescales due to
temporally differential galactic winds; after a starburst, stellar feedback
expels gas, leaving a large population of asymptotic-giant-branch stars to
dominate the enrichment of the relatively low-mass interstellar medium. NRGs
lie below the main sequence and typically exhibit
$\mathrm{EW}[\mathrm{H}\beta]\lesssim40$ Å, in apparent tension with observed
high-EW NRGs. This tension is reconciled if observed NRGs are in the initial
stages of a subsequent starburst, illuminating previously enriched gas, which
is supported by the finding of high SFR surface density nitrogen-rich giant
molecular clouds.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08612v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nature or Nurture: LMC-like Dust in the Solar Metallicity Galaxy M31</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Geoffrey C.

area of M31 having galactocentric distances of 5 to 16 kpc, enabling the
analysis of UV extinction curve variations over a large region of an external
galaxy similar to the Milky Way with global galactic characteristics such as
metallicity for the first time. No correlation is found between the extinction
parameters and galactocentric distance which might be expected if there is a
radial metallicity gradient in M31. Most of the new UV extinction curves
presented here are significantly different from the average extinction curves
of the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, but the average M31 extinction curve is similar
to the average extinction curve in the 30-Dor region of the LMC. The wide range
of extinction curves seen in each individual Local Group galaxy suggests that
global galactic properties such as metallicity may be less important than the
local environmental conditions such as density, UV radiation field, and shocks
along each sightline. The combined behavior of the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and now
M31 UV extinction curves supports the idea that there is a family of curves in
the Local Group with overlapping dust grain properties between different

gets stripped by ram-pressure, suffer galaxy interactions and witness quenching
of their star formation. Clusters, like Abell 2142, grow not only through
galaxy accretion but also through group infall. Our goal is to study the
physical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a
filament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is
the leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas
stripped by ram-pressure. The infalling galaxies are not quenched yet, and are
ideal objects to study the transformation processes due to the cluster
environment. We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar
and gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with
age and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst.
The gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of
H$\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of
which two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a
simple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling
the contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics.
The galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and
loops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated
dispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star
formation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\odot$/yr. We conclude
that the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium,
present before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure
stripping of the galaxy gas. The galaxy interactions within the group are still
enhancing the star formation, from the disks that are still rich in dense gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08589v1" target="_blank"><h2>A new type-1 transition in NGC 1346 revealed by (spectro)polarimetry</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  F.

changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC~1346 taken with the Perkins telescope
(November 2022, March 2025) and VLT/FORS2 (August and September 2024), which
have revealed a new spectral transition. We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to
its former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active
galactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\beta$ (3720
$\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\alpha$ (2985 $\pm$ 230
km.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024,
suggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The
strong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that
the gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven
outflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\sim$ 3\%) and 2024-2025's
de-biased polarization ($\le$ 0.5\%), the blueing of the spectra between August
and September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and
2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in
front of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or
a tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346.
Timely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are
needed to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07629v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: Early Release Observations. Weak gravitational lensing analysis

distortions over wide areas on the sky. Here we present a weak gravitational
lensing analysis of early Euclid observations obtained for the field around the
massive galaxy cluster Abell 2390 as part of the Euclid Early Release
Observations programme. We conduct galaxy shape measurements using three
independent algorithms (LensMC, KSB+, and SourceXtractor++). Incorporating
multi-band photometry from Euclid and Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we estimate
photometric redshifts to preferentially select background sources from
tomographic redshift bins, for which we calibrate the redshift distributions
using the self-organising map approach and data from the Cosmic Evolution
Survey (COSMOS). We quantify the residual cluster member contamination and
correct for it in bins of photometric redshift and magnitude using their source
density profiles, including corrections for source obscuration and
magnification. We reconstruct the cluster mass distribution and jointly fit the
tangential reduced shear profiles of the different tomographic bins with
spherical Navarro--Frenk--White profile predictions to constrain the cluster
mass, finding consistent results for the three shape catalogues and good
agreement with earlier measurements. As an important validation test we compare
these joint constraints to mass measurements obtained individually for the
different tomographic bins, finding good consistency. More detailed constraints
on the cluster properties are presented in a companion paper that additionally
incorporates strong lensing measurements. Our analysis provides a first
demonstration of the outstanding capabilities of Euclid for tomographic weak

stellar streams and merger remnants, often relies on the dynamics of their
constituent stars. However, this approach has limitations due to the complex
dynamical interactions between these structures and their environment.
Perturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential
escape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss
of dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying
solely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or
dispersed remnants. We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a
system of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying
accreted structures in the Galactic halo. We developed an integrated approach
combining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs),
autoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure
named CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the
Galactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs)
and then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams. CREEK successfully
recovered 80% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several
known stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally,
within highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures
that exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies. This approach
provides an objective data-driven method for selecting stars associated with
streams and stellar structures in general.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07991v1" target="_blank"><h2>Baryonification II: Constraining feedback with X-ray and kinematic

scales, posing a challenge for precision cosmology. The new, component-wise
baryonification (BFC) approach provides a self-consistent framework to model
feedback effects for different observables. In this paper we use this framework
to fit kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) observations from the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT) alongside halo X-ray gas fractions from eROSITA,
investigating baryonic feedback in a cosmological context. We first show that
the kSZ data from ACT is consistent with the gas fractions from eROSITA, both
suggesting a feedback model that is stronger than what is assumed in most
hydrodynamical simulations. This finding is in contrast to older, pre-eROSITA
gas fraction measurements that point towards weaker feedback in tension with
the kSZ results. We suspect these discrepancies to be due to selection bias in
the pre-eROSITA sample, or differences in halo mass estimation between the two
data sets. In a further step, we use the BFC model to predict the baryonic
suppression of the matter power spectrum. Based on our combined fit to data
from ACT and eROSITA, we find a power spectrum suppression that exceeds the
percent-level at modes above $k=0.3-0.6 \,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, growing to 2-8
percent at $k=1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and to 20-25 percent at
$k=5\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, consistent with strong-feedback hydrodynamical
simulations. Finally, we compare our best-fitting model to the observed gas
density and pressure profiles of massive galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample,
finding excellent agreement. These results show that BFC provides a
self-consistent picture of feedback across mass- and length scales as well as
different cosmological observables, thus making it promising for applications
to multiwavelength studies to jointly constrain cosmology and baryonic effects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08798v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: High-redshift measurement of structure

redshifts by combining CMB lensing observations from ACT DR6 and
$\textit{Planck}$ PR4 with the overdensity of quasars from Quaia, a
$\textit{Gaia}$ and $\textit{unWISE}$ quasar catalog. Our analysis includes the
CMB lensing power spectrum from ACT DR6, the auto-correlation of two Quaia
quasar samples centered at $z \simeq 1.0$ and $z \simeq 2.1$, and their
cross-correlations with CMB lensing from both ACT DR6 and $\textit{Planck}$
PR4. By performing a series of contamination and systematic null tests, we find
no evidence for contamination in the lensing maps, contrary to what was
suggested in previous Quaia cross-correlation analyses using $\textit{Planck}$
PR4 CMB lensing data. From the joint analysis of the quasar auto- and
cross-correlations with CMB lensing, and including BOSS BAO data to break the
degeneracy between $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, we obtain $\sigma_8 =
0.802^{+0.045}_{-0.057}$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from
$\textit{Planck}$ primary CMB measurements. Combining the CMB lensing
auto-spectrum with the cross-correlation measurement improves the constraint on
$\sigma_8$ by $12\%$ relative to the lensing auto-spectrum alone, yielding
$\sigma_8 = 0.804 \pm 0.013$. This dataset combination also enables a
reconstruction of structure growth across redshifts. We infer a $12\%$
constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations at $z > 3$, with a
measurement at the median redshift of the signal of $\sigma_8(\tilde{z}=5.1) =
0.146^{+0.021}_{-0.014}$, consistent with $\textit{Planck}$ at the $1.4\sigma$

dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for
gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach
first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic
components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By
applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and
temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against
hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature
varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density
and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we
calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from
the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify
$N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum
suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out
this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2
percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We
also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for
feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The
2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than
2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys.
Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body
simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual
inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the
integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to

  Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mengye Wang, Qingwen Wu, Yiqiu Ma</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13pages, 8 figures, Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single
interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential
source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities.
Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can
significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such
as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct
estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In
this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of
1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian
\emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance
the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system
and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects
together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as
high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in
encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the
enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger
radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed
within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the
BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a
timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures
of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08651v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical abundances and small-scale gas kinematics in the local

Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we
examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances
across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71

via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most
of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the
other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates
suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized
spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal

generalise here to the case of cross-correlations between multiple fields. The
projected galaxy bispectrum is detected at very high significance (above
$30\sigma$ in all redshift bins), and the galaxy-galaxy-convergence bispectrum
is detected above $5\sigma$ in the three highest-redshift bins. We find that
the bispectrum is reasonably well described over a broad range of scales by a
tree-level prediction using the linear galaxy bias measured from the power
spectrum. We carry out the first cosmological analysis combining projected
power spectra and bispectra under a relatively simple model, and show that the
galaxy bispectrum can be used in combination with the power spectrum to place a
constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, an on the
non-relativistic matter fraction $\Omega_m$. We find that data combinations
involving the galaxy bispectrum recover constraints on these parameters that
are in good agreement with those found from the traditional

emission are measures for the strengths of total, ordered, and isotropic
turbulent fields in the sky plane. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) provide a
model of the regular field. The quadratic difference between ordered and
regular field strengths yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field.
- Based on observations of M31 at 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20.5 cm wavelengths and
assuming equipartition between the energy densities of total magnetic fields
and total cosmic rays, we measured average equipartition strengths of the
magnetic field in the emission torus of M31 of 6.3\pm\0.2 \muG for the total,
5.4\pm0.2 \muG for the isotropic turbulent, and 3.2\pm0.3 \muG for the ordered
field in the sky plane. The average strength of the axisymmetric regular field,
Breg, is 2.0\pm0.5 \muG and remains almost constant between 7 kpc and 12 kpc
radius. Quadratic subtraction of the component Breg,perp in the sky plane from
the ordered field Bord,perp yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent
field Ban,perp, which is 2.7\pm0.7 \muG. - The average strength of the regular
field is about 40% smaller than the equipartition strength of the ordered
field, which is consistent with the assumption of equipartition. The almost
constant ratio between regular and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.39 is
consistent with present-day dynamo models. The almost constant ratio between
anisotropic and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.57 indicates that
anisotropic turbulent fields are generated by the shearing of isotropic
turbulent fields. - The average magnetic energy density is about five times
larger than the thermal energy density of the diffuse warm ionized gas, while
the magnetic energy density is similar to the kinetic energy density of

detail via the weak lensing (WL) signature of billions of distant galaxies. The
WL signal is most prominent around galaxy clusters, and can extend up to
distances well beyond their virial radius, thus constraining their total mass.
Near the centre of clusters, where contamination by member galaxies is an
issue, the WL data can be complemented with strong lensing (SL) data which can
diminish the uncertainty due to the mass-sheet degeneracy and provide
high-resolution information about the distribution of matter in the centre of
clusters. Here we present a joint SL and WL analysis of the Euclid Early
Release Observations of the cluster Abell 2390 at z=0.228. Thanks to Euclid's
wide field of view of 0.5 deg$^$2, combined with its angular resolution in the
visible band of 0."13 and sampling of 0."1 per pixel, we constrain the density
profile in a wide range of radii, 30 kpc < r < 2000 kpc, from the inner region
near the brightest cluster galaxy to beyond the virial radius of the cluster.
We find consistency with earlier X-ray results based on assumptions of
hydrostatic equilibrium, thus indirectly confirming the nearly relaxed state of
this cluster. We also find consistency with previous results based on weak
lensing data and ground-based observations of this cluster. From the combined
SL+WL profile, we derive the values of the viral mass $M_{200} = (1.48 \pm
0.29)\times10^{15}\, \Msun$, and virial radius $r_{200} =(2.05\pm0.13 \, {\rm
Mpc}$), with error bars representing one standard deviation. The profile is
well described by an NFW model with concentration c=6.5 and a small-scale
radius of 230 kpc in the 30\,kpc $< r <$ 2000\,kpc range that is best
constrained by SL and WL data. Abell 2390 is the first of many examples where
Euclid data will play a crucial role in providing masses for clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07558v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Gaia RVS Benchmark Stars. III . Confirmed and New High Radial

providing the community a way to select stars for their kinematics and the
radial velocity, one of the speed components, is derived from the Gaia RVS

positive. They are rare and as such they are more easily impacted than lower
velocity stars, by contamination by very low SNR spurious measures. We here
investigate a sample of 26 stars with Gaia absolute radial velocity in excess
of 500___km/s with spectroscopic follow-up observations with UVES. For all but
one star the extreme radial velocity is confirmed and these stars are all
metal-poor and, as expected, enhanced in the elements. The complete chemical

understand this in the context of a model in which powerful AGN jets enhance
star formation for up to hundreds of millions of years while jet power
decreases in time, followed by a longer phase in which star formation is
suppressed but coupled to jet power increasing with time. We also highlight
characteristic differences depending on environment richness in a way that is
also compatible with the observed SEDs of high redshift radio galaxies. While
the absence of a direct correlation between jet power and star formation rate
emerges naturally, our framework allows us to also predict the environment
richness, range of excitation and redshift values of radio AGN in the jet

Abell 3558, located in the core of the Shapley Supercluster. Using new MeerKAT
UHF-Band and uGMRT Band-3 observations, and published MeerKAT L-band and ASKAP
887 MHz data, we perform a detailed analysis of the diffuse emission in the
cluster centre. We complement with XMM-Newton X-ray information for a thorough
study of the connection between the thermal and non-thermal properties of the
cluster. We find that the diffuse radio emission in the cluster centre is more
extended than published earlier, with a previously undetected extension
spanning 100 kpc towards the north beyond the innermost cold front, increasing
the total size of the emission to 550 kpc, and shows a clear spatial
correlation with the X-ray features. The overall radio spectrum is steep
($\alpha_{\rm 400\,MHz}^{\rm 1569\,MHz}=1.18\pm0.10$), with local fluctuations
which show several connections with the X-ray surface brightness, cold fronts,
and residual emission. The point-to-point correlation between the radio and
X-ray surface brightness is sub-linear, and steepens with increasing frequency.
We discuss the classification of the diffuse emission considering its overall
properties, those of the ICM, and the existing scaling laws between the radio
and X-ray quantities in galaxy clusters. We conclude that it is a mini-halo,
powered by turbulent (re)-acceleration induced by sloshing motions within the

$10^{9} M_{\odot}$ merely hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang
generates tension with the idea of Eddington-limited accretion and pressures
the community into exploring the concept of massive black hole seeds and/or
super-Eddington accretion. The observation that many black holes have reached
supermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion
models are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the
physics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically
thick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides
the radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of
the inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section
drops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite
being Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section
calculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time
drops by up to $47\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ black
hole can form from a seed $10 M_{\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of
accretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a
number of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in
that it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and
cosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black
holes have grown rapidly despite that limit.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07964v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact

Code release:this https URL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by
intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a
gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a
closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave
source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed
events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population
outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed,
nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers.
This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on
observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because
lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources,
which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier
implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We
additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical
depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or
absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest
gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on
the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or
more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs
will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the
optical depth. Future work will investigate the ability of the full inferred
population of compact binaries to inform the distribution of lenses in the
Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and
constrain cosmic structures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07963v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Semi-Analytic model for Effects of Fuzzy Dark Matter Granule

effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion
approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the
perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be
applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to
finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos
behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed
perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using
FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule

dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic
background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production
and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of
thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle
scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that
the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to
radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal
gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to
that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We
also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find
that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100
GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises
from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The
flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during
WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection
prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved
slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging.
The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the
amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI
models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum
contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton
contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally
expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the
cosmic microwave background.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08687v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interpreting Hubble tension with a cascade decaying dark matter sector</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Quan Zhou, Zixuan Xu, Sibo Zheng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time

a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces
relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently
decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with
four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck
2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits,
neutrino flux bounds, and Planck and SDSS data about matter power spectra.
Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and

observed features of our Universe, but its viability depends on an efficient
reheating phase that converts the inflaton's energy into Standard Model
particles. This conversion often proceeds through non-perturbative mechanisms
such as parametric resonance, which is described by Hill's equation. In this
work, we investigate how stochastic fluctuations in the parameters of Hill's
equation can influence particle production during reheating. We show that such
fluctuations can arise from couplings to light scalar fields, and can
significantly alter the stability bands in the resonance structure, thereby
enhancing the growth of fluctuations and broadening the region of efficient
energy transfer. Using random matrix theory and stochastic differential
equations, we decompose the particle growth rate into deterministic and
noise-induced components and demonstrate analytically and numerically that even
modest noise leads to substantial particle production in otherwise stable
regimes. These results suggest that stochastic effects can robustly enhance the
efficacy of reheating across a wide swath of parameter space, with implications
for early Universe cosmology, UV completions involving multiple scalar fields,
and the resolution of the cosmological moduli problem.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07798v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring non-cold dark matter in a scenario of dynamical dark energy

a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform
analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI
DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia
supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of
CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS
parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a
constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$
and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$.
Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and
$w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and
Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model
relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a

various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this
paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic
theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not
limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or
axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such
as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and
phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the
non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for
systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The
latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains
dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally,
we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar
field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound
speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account
for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating
ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we

by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early
universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism,
the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically
compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that
such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs
heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH
mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of
next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and
Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing
the PBH dark matter scenario.</p></br></body>
