1.1334$ ultra-strong MgII absorption system identified in the $VLT$/UVES
spectrum of a background quasar located at $\rho \approx 18$ kpc from a
star-forming galaxy. Low ionization metal lines like MgI, FeII, and CaII are
also detected for this absorber. The HI lines are outside of the wavelength
coverage. The MgII has a rest-frame equivalent width of $W_r(2796) =3.185 +/-
0.032 A^{\circ} $, with the absorption spread across $\Delta v \approx 460$
km~s$^{-1}$ in several components. A component-by-component ionization modeling
shows several of these components having solar and higher metallicities. The
models also predict a total HI column density of $log[N(HI)/cm^{-2}] \approx
22.5$, consistent with ultra-strong MgII absorbers being sub-Damped Lyman Alpha
and Damped Lyman Alpha systems. The absorber is well within the virial radius
of the nearest galaxy which has a stellar mass $M_* = 4.7 \times
10^{10}$~M$_\odot$, and a star formation rate of $\approx
8.3$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. The absorption is along the projected major axis of
the galaxy with a velocity spread that is wider than the galaxy's disk
rotation. From the kinematic analysis of the absorber and the galaxy, the
origin of the absorption can be attributed to a combination of circumgalactic
gas structures, some corotating with the disk and the rest at line-of-sight
velocities outside of the disk rotation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02708v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ultra-strong MgII absorbers trace both inflowing and outflowing gas:

$0.4 \leq z \leq 0.6$, each exhibiting ultra-strong MgII absorption
($W_{r,2796} \geq 3$ {\AA}), probing both down-the-barrel and transverse gas
flows. Down-the-barrel galaxy spectra reveal outflows in three galaxies ($v =
19$ to $311$ km s$^{-1}$) and inflows in five ($v = 61$ to $361$ km s$^{-1}$),
including one system showing inflows and outflows simultaneously. All galaxies
with detected inflows are below the star-forming main sequence, suggesting that
they might be actively replenishing their gas reservoirs. Outflows have a mean
covering fraction of $C_{f, \rm out}=0.5$, whereas inflows show a lower average
of $C_{f, \rm in}=0.3$. Mass flow rates span $\dot{M}_{\rm in} = 0.01-1.18$
$M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for inflows and $\dot{M}_{\rm out} = 0.23-1.03$
$M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for outflows, yielding mass loading factors below
unity and implying these galaxies cannot sustain their current level of
star-formation rates. These results are based on the T $\sim 10^4$ K
photoionised gas phase traced by MgII; additional accreting/outflowing material
in other gas phases may also be present, but remains undetected in this study.
Quasar sightlines consistently show redshifted inflow components and
blueshifted outflow components, demonstrating that ultra-strong MgII absorbers
trace baryon cycling out to impact parameters of $D = 15$-31 kpc. Moreover, the
unexpectedly high prevalence of inflows suggests that ultra-strong MgII
absorbers offer a powerful strategy for future surveys to systematically map
inflow and outflow cycles across cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01315v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neutral hydrogen in and around galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  V.

galaxies offer a unique probe of reionization's earliest stages. However,
disentangling absorption by the increasingly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM)
from that in galaxies' interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM, CGM)
remains challenging due to the poorly constrained nature of neutral hydrogen
(HI) in and around galaxies at these redshifts. We use the SERRA
high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to characterize the HI
distribution and its evolution along sightlines to star-forming regions during
reionization, to interpret the contribution of local HI (ISM+CGM) to Ly$\alpha$
absorption in $z>5$ spectra. We analyze $\sim 100$ $z=6-9.5$ galaxies,
generating mock sightlines from each galaxy's star formation peak. We study the
sightline distribution of HI column densities ($N_{\rm HI}$) and its variation
with radius, halo mass and redshift. We find broad sightline variation in
$N_{\rm HI}$ (0.5-1.5dex) due to complex ISM morphology driven by bursty star
formation, with median $\log(N_{\rm HI}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) \simeq 21-22$. Dense ISM
gas is the dominant origin of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems along
sightlines towards star-forming regions, outweighing gas in the CGM, filaments
and proximate absorbers. Median $N_{\rm HI}$ increases with halo mass, scaling
roughly with the virial radius, as expected due to larger potentials and more
extended CGM, but shows negligible redshift evolution at fixed halo mass. This
suggests post-reionization $N_{\rm HI}$ distributions may provide useful priors
to interpret IGM damping wings at higher redshifts. To interpret strong $z>5$
DLA candidates found by JWST, we investigate $N_{\rm HI}>10^{22}{\rm cm}^{-2}$
sightlines. These trace dense, metal-enriched ISM within <1 kpc of massive
halos, a scenario testable with higher-resolution spectroscopy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01486v1" target="_blank"><h2>Feeding frenzy in the mighty black holes: what we could learn from them?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Swayamtrupta Panda, Hygor Benati Gonçalves, Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann, Marzena Śniegowska, Bożena Czerny, Edi Bon, Paola Marziani, Nataša Bon, Alberto Rodríguez Ardila, Daniel May, Marcos Fonseca Faría, Luciano Fraga, Francisco Pozo Nuñez, Eduardo Bañados, Jochen Heidt, Karla Garnica, Deborah Dultzin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 8 figures, review based on the invited talk at the 15th Serbian Conference on Spectral Line Shapes in Astrophysics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), QSO (abstract), quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and
life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a
multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN
studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the
Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars
(QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of
the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects
by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust,
nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington
ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for
interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST.
Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive
high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification:
Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in
the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field
spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy,
rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the
high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation
mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM)
offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling
efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we
developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for
extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic
extreme physical conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01430v2" target="_blank"><h2>13 Billion Years of MgII Absorber Evolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Christopher W.

for weaker absorbers (Wr < 0.3 [angstroms]). We bracketed two data-driven
scenarios: from z ~ 7 to z ~ 4, dN/dX of weak absorbers is (1) constant, or (2)
decreasing. For scenario #1, the evolution of Phi*(z), W*(z), and alpha(z) show
that in the post-reionization universe, weak systems are nonevolving while the
incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following
Cosmic Noon, the strongest absorbers slowly evolve away while the incidence of
weak absorbers rapidly increases. For scenario #2, the parameter evolution is
such that, in the post-reionization universe, weak systems evolve away while
the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following
Cosmic Noon, the behavior tracks the same as scenario #1. We argue in favor of
scenario #2 based on corroborating OI, CII, and SiII measurements at z > 4. Our
results provide a unified, quantitative description for MgII absorber evolution
spanning 13 billion years of cosmic time and offer deeper insights into
galactic baryon cycle physics. They also highlight the need for deep z > 5 MgII

and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially in low-luminosity
AGN (LLAGN) systems. NGC 1266 hosts one such LLAGN, embedded in a massive
molecular gas reservoir that is not forming stars, likely due to AGN feedback.
We analyze deep archival \textit{Chandra} data to constrain the properties of
its hot gas and compare them to other wind systems. We find temperatures of
$0.24$--$1.85$ keV and notably high electron densities of $0.33$--$4.2$
cm$^{-3}$, suggesting significant mass loading, further supported by charge
exchange emission in the southern lobe, one of the few AGN systems where it has
been detected. We measure pressures and thermal energies of $10^6$--$10^8$~K
cm$^{-3}$ and $10^{54}$--$10^{56}$ erg, exceeding the minimum energy needed for
the radio jet to power the outflow and implying the hot phase comprises a large
fraction of the energy budget. Archival MUSE data reveal a cavity-like feature
in the southern outflow, potentially associated with the far side of the
outflow cone. At the maximum outflow extent, the warm and hot phases appear to
be in pressure equilibrium. Coupled with short cooling timescales of $\sim$1
Myr, comparable to the advection time, this suggests the outflow is undergoing
radiative cooling and may have stalled. Finally, we compare NGC 1266 to other
local AGN and starburst galaxies, finding NGC 1266 to be the densest wind in
the sample.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02517v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of AGN and nuclear star formation on the ISM turbulence of

can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the
SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as
it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of
turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and
intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF
galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54
galaxies at z<0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853,
[FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from
W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line
ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin
of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the
largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less
turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity
dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the
nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5--1 kpc, followed by an outward
increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display
increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line
ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most
turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We
speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and
jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be
created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an
important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from
cooling and forming new stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00959v1" target="_blank"><h2>From atoms to stars: Modelling $\mathrm{H}_2$ formation and its impact

incorporating molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$) production via dust grain
condensation and its destruction through star formation and photodissociation.
Implemented within the magnetohydrodynamical code AREPO, our model tracks the
non-equilibrium mass fractions of molecular, ionised, and atomic hydrogen, as
well as a stellar component, by solving a system of differential equations
governing mass exchange between these phases. Star formation is treated with a
variable rate dependent on the local $\mathrm{H}_2$ abundance, which itself
varies in a complex way with key quantities such as gas density and
metallicity. Testing the model in a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass
galaxy, we obtain a well-defined spiral structure at $z = 0$, including a gas
disc twice the size of the stellar one, alongside a realistic star formation
history. Our results show a broad range of star formation efficiencies per
free-fall time, from as low as $0.001\%$ at high redshift to values between
$0.1\%$ and $10\%$ for ages $\gtrsim 3-4 \, \mathrm{Gyr}$. These findings align
well with observational estimates and simulations of a turbulent interstellar
medium. Notably, our model reproduces a star formation rate versus molecular
hydrogen surface densities relation akin to the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt
law. Furthermore, we find that the star formation efficiency varies with
density and metallicity, providing an alternative to fixed-efficiency
assumptions and enabling comparisons with more detailed star formation models.
Comparing different star formation prescriptions, we find that in models that
link star formation to $\mathrm{H}_2$, star formation onset is $\sim \! 500 \,
\mathrm{Myr}$ later than those relying solely on total or cold gas density.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01029v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Clustering of Active Galactic Nuclei and Star Forming Galaxies in

Fields, this work measures the angular clustering of star forming galaxies
(SFGs) and low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) to $z$$\lesssim$1.5 for faint
sources, $S_{\textrm{144 MHz}}$$\geq$200 $\mu$Jy. We measure the angular
auto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation
with multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs
and LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from
$b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z
\sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in
previous LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in
broad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence
of bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at
fixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes
available. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with
$b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \sim
1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model
($b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs
which reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they
are more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b =
2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \sim
1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to
their properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias
evolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer
analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01972v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Disk Plus (Failed) Wind System of 3C 47: A Story of Accretion Disks

supermassive black holes are thought to contribute to broad-line emission in
type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, observed emission line profiles
most often deviate from those expected from a rotating disk. This report
examines the role of accretion disks in broad-line emission of Population B AGN
characterized by relatively low accretion rates in which broad lines show large
redward asymmetry both in H$\beta$ and Mg II$\lambda$ 2800. An unbiased
comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most
powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$\beta$.
These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift
effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\approx$10$^{8.7}$
M$_\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece
to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described
by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the
range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line
profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind
contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio
properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the
presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\sim$
0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line
profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission
truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving
systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission,
rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01092v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quasar Main Sequence unfolded by 2.5D FRADO (Natural expression of

serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully
self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically
motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model
naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\dot{m}$) is the primary physical
driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$)
acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations
of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a
representative range of $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we
computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$ line under
different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the
characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the
role of $\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\rm
Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\dot{m}$ can be regarded as
the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale
directly with it. The $M_{\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter
in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\rm Fe}$ and FWHM
for a given $\dot{m}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01773v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identifying tidal disruption events among radio transient galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS).
Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble
young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and
characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are
likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few
sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio
variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we
extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our
sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and
infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are
massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN).
They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud
AGNs ($\rm >10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In
contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure
star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to
radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit
infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not
display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the
evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which
we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of
the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered
TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that
the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio
transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02432v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Entangled Feedback Impacts of Supernovae in Coarse- versus

responsible for regulating star formation and generating gaseous outflows.
However, a detailed look at their effect on the local interstellar medium (ISM)
on small mass scales in simulations shows that these processes proceed in
clearly distinct channels. We demonstrate this finding in two independent
simulations with solar-mass resolution, LYRA and RIGEL, of an isolated dwarf
galaxy. Focusing on the immediate environment surrounding SNe, our findings
suggest that the large-scale effect of a given SN on the galaxy is best
predicted by its immediate local density. Outflows are driven by SNe in diffuse
regions expanding to their cooling radii on large ($\sim$ kpc) scales, while
dense star-forming regions are disrupted in a localized (\sim pc) manner.
However, these separate feedback channels are only distinguishable at very high
numerical resolutions capable of following scales $\ll 10^3 M_\odot$. On larger
scales, ISM densities are greatly mis-estimated, and differences between local
environments of SNe become severely washed out. We demonstrate the practical
implications of this effect by comparing with a mid-resolution simulation
($M_{\rm ptcl.} \sim 200 M_\odot$) of the same dwarf using the SMUGGLE model.
The coarse-resolution simulation cannot self-consistently determine whether a
given SN is responsible for generating outflows or suppressing star formation,
suggesting that emergent galaxy physics such as star formation regulation
through hot-phase outflows is fundamentally unresolvable by subgrid stellar
feedback models, without appealing directly to simulations with highly resolved
ISM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00400v1" target="_blank"><h2>Uncertainties in high-$z$ galaxy properties inferred from SED fitting

Space Telescope (JWST), providing new insights into early galaxy evolution.
Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach for such early
systems remains uncertain. Applying {\sc Bagpipes} on simulated SEDs at $z=6$
from the {\sc Sphinx$^{20}$} cosmological simulation, we examine uncertainties
in the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR$_{10}$), and
stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry. Even
without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum
overestimates the stellar mass by about 60\% on average (and by up to a factor
of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts) and underestimates
SFR$_{10}$ by a factor of two, owing to inaccurate star formation histories and
age-metallicity degeneracies. The addition of dust and nebular emission further
amplifies these biases, yielding offsets of approximately +0.3 and -0.4 dex in
stellar mass and SFR$_{10}$, respectively, while leaving stellar metallicities
largely unconstrained. Incorporating bands free of strong emission lines, such
as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line
emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best-fit or
likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior
values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well, the
slope of the star formation main sequence depends sensitively on the adopted
fitting model. Overall, these results underscore the importance of careful
modelling when interpreting high-$z$ photometry, particularly for galaxies with
recent star formation burst and/or strong emission lines, to minimise
systematic biases in derived physical properties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00813v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational lensing of 21 cm HI signal: detection prospects at z ~ 1

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), atomic hydrogen (abstract), baryon cycle (abstract), feedback (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star
formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves
processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While
probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI
detection is essentially limited to $z \lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of
the 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking
technique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational
lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the
redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in
cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI
emission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the
uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong
likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the
HI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models
provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in
blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from
galaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred
hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI
emission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical
appears to be more promising with potential for a $5\sigma$ detection in $<50$
hours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $<75$ hours for Abell 1703
with the uGMRT.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02449v1" target="_blank"><h2>4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS): Clustering properties of CRS BG

spectroscopic redshifts over $\sim5700$\,deg$^2$ to map large-scale structure
and enable measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), growth rates
via redshift-space distortions, and cross-correlations with weak-lensing
surveys. We validate the target selections, photometry, masking, systematics
and redshift distributions of the CRS Bright Galaxy (BG) and Luminous Red
Galaxy (LRG) target catalogues selected from DESI Legacy Surveys DR10.1
imaging. We measure the angular two-point correlation function, test masking
strategies, and recover redshift distributions via cross-correlation with DESI
DR1 spectroscopy. For BG, we adopt Legacy Survey \texttt{MASKBITS} that veto
bright stars, SGA large galaxies, and globular clusters; for LRG, we pair these
with an unWISE W1 artefact mask. These choices suppress small-scale excess
power without imprinting large-scale modes. A Limber-scaling test across BG
$r$-band magnitude slices shows that, after applying the scaling, the
$w(\theta)$ curves collapse to a near-common power law over the fitted angular
range, demonstrating photometric uniformity with depth and consistency between
the North (NGC) and South (SGC) Galactic Caps. Cross-correlations with DESI
spectroscopy recover the expected $N(z)$, with higher shot noise at the
brightest magnitudes. For LRGs, angular clustering in photo-$z$ slices ($0.4\le
z<1.0$) is mutually consistent between the DECaLS and DES footprints at fixed
$z$ and is well described by an approximate power law once photo-$z$ smearing
is accounted for; halo-occupation fits yield results consistent with recent LRG
studies. Together, these tests indicate that the masks and target selections
yield uniform clustering statistics, supporting precision large-scale structure
analyses with 4MOST CRS.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00927v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fuzzy dark matter dynamical friction: Defying galactic cannibalism of

Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), ISM (title, abstract), IGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a new implementation of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) dynamical friction
within the galpy framework, enabling orbital integrations of globular clusters
(GCs) across a broad range of halo-to-GC mass ratios and boson masses. In this
alternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by
heating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of
baryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the
efficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most
significant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the
dwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs
over a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and
halting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our
FDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since
the inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs
through core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ
populations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses
the mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial
distribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems
encode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs. These predictions open
a new pathway to constrain the boson mass parameter with upcoming Euclid DR1
observations of extragalactic GCs, while simultaneously offering a natural
explanation for the long-standing Fornax timing problem.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01421v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ly-alpha emission reveals two satellite halos around massive groups at z

(LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs
at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant
LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that
Ly$\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$.
This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With
sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae
are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only
shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs,
suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat
are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and
$12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode
accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically
distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an
elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty
star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns
well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo,
making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting
onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to
morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active
galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$
filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE
(and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to
efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure
and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01314v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Observations of Starbursts: PAHs Closely Trace the Cool Phase of

the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To
investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3~$\mu$m from the outflow of
the prototypical starburst M82 out to $3.2$ kpc. We find that PAH emission
shows significant correlations with CO, H$\alpha$, and X-ray emission within
the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with
gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly
with cold molecular gas, with PAH--CO scaling relations in the wind nearly
identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The
H$\alpha$--PAH correlation indicates that H$\alpha$ traces the surfaces of
PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by
shocks. Meanwhile the PAH--X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects
are controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot
gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the
outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with
variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the
product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly
over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that
PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the
starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life
cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.</p></br></body>
