the most energetic objects of the Universe. While they are thought to be
ignited by galaxy mergers and affect the surrounding gas, observational
constraints on both processes remain scarce. Here we unveil a major merging
system at redshift $z \approx 2.7$, and demonstrate that radiation from the
quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the other galaxy.
Our findings reveal that the galaxies, with centroids separated by only a few
kiloparsecs and approaching each other at speed $\approx550\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$,
are massive, form stars, and contain a substantial molecular mass. Yet, dusty
molecular gas seen in absorption against the quasar nucleus is highly excited
and confined within cloudlets with densities $\sim 10^5$ - $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and
sizes $<$0.02 pc, several orders of magnitude more compact than those observed
in intervening (non-quasar) environments. This is also approximately 10$^5$
times smaller than currently resolvable through molecular-line emission at high
redshifts. We infer that, wherever exposed to the quasar radiation, molecular
gas is disrupted, leaving behind surviving dense clouds too small to give birth
to new stars. Our results not only underscore the role of major galaxy mergers
in triggering quasar activity, but also reveal localized negative feedback as a
profound alteration of internal gas structure which likely hampers star
formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15127v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatial and velocity anisotropies of stellar halos across cosmic web
  environments: Insights from IllustrisTNG simulation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Amit Mondal, Biswajit Pandey, Anindita Nandi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The role of large-scale environment in shaping the structural and kinematic
properties of stellar halos remains an open question. We investigate whether
the cosmic web environments affect the spatial and velocity anisotropies of
stellar halos in Milky Way-mass galaxies. Using high-resolution data from the
TNG50 simulation, we analyze 29 stellar halos from each environment and
quantify their spatial and kinematic anisotropies as a function of halo-centric
radius. We find that stellar halos across all environments generally exhibit
increasing spatial anisotropy with radius, with fluctuations corresponding to
bound substructures. The velocity anisotropy profiles show radially dominated
orbits on average, but also display significant local variation, including
tangentially dominated regions. However, no statistically significant
differences are observed in the mean spatial or velocity anisotropy profiles
across environments, for either the total stellar halo population or for the in
situ and ex situ components individually. The large scatter within each
environment suggests that the formation of stellar halos is primarily driven by
stochastic, small-scale processes such as satellite merger histories, rather
than the large-scale geometry of the cosmic web. Our results imply that, at
fixed halo mass, the influence of cosmic web environment on the structure of
stellar halo is weak or highly non-deterministic. Possible environmental
effects may be more prominent at higher masses where accretion is more
anisotropic. Exploring this regime will require simulations with both larger
volume and higher resolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15470v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PAU Survey: Measuring intrinsic galaxy alignments in deep wide

the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) deep wide fields, which
include the W1 and W3 fields from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy

analyses cover 51deg$^{2}$, in the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) range $0.1
< z_{\mathrm{b}} < 1$ and a magnitude limit $i_{\mathrm{AB}}<22$. The precise
photo-$z$s and the luminosity coverage of PAUS enable robust IA measurements,
which are key for setting informative priors for upcoming stage-IV surveys. For
red galaxies, we detect an increase in IA amplitude with both luminosity and
stellar mass, extending previous results towards fainter and less massive
regimes. As a function of redshift, we observe strong IA signals at
intermediate ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.55$) and high ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.75$)
redshift bins. However, we find no significant trend of IA evolution with
redshift after accounting for the varying luminosities across redshift bins,
consistent with the literature. For blue galaxies, no significant IA signal is
detected, with $A_{1}=0.68_{-0.51}^{+0.53}$ when splitting only by galaxy
colour, yielding some of the tightest constraints to date for the blue

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A detailed understanding of cosmic-ray transport in galactic halos is
essential for explaining various observations, such as the radio continuum
measurements of synchrotron radiation from energetic electrons. Of central
importance is the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays, which can be
computed in an ab initio manner if the turbulence in the background medium is
known. The study aimed to establish a suitable framework to compute the
evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and, hence, the diffusion
tensor in the dynamical halos of galaxies. The Reynolds-averaged single-fluid
MHD equation were solved numerically on a cylindrical grid, assuming axial
symmetry and fixed boundary conditions on a central ellipsoid representing the
galaxy. The physical properties of both large-scale MHD and small-scale
turbulent quantities, including the coefficients of parallel and perpendicular
diffusion, were extracted from the resulting steady state. Hydrodynamic
validation revealed a persistent instability of the near-axis flow, which could
be traced to the galaxy's gravitating mass. The results for the evolution of
MHD turbulence in a galactic halo - using parameters approximating those of
NGC4631 - enabled an ab initio computation of the spatial diffusion tensor of
cosmic rays through the application of a state-of-the-art nonlinear theory. The
simulation results reveal variation in turbulence quantities, (i.e.,
fluctuation energy, correlation scale, and cross helicity) in a dynamical halo.
Furthermore, the corresponding diffusion tensor of cosmic rays exhibits
significant variation throughout such a halo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15073v1" target="_blank"><h2>Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project. V. Velocity-resolved

Project. We detect unambiguous velocity-resolved structures in 12 AGNs, among
which eight objects exhibit symmetric structures, two objects show inflow-like

we successfully measure the velocity-resolved lags in different years,
revealing evidence of evolving broad-line region (BLR) kinematics. By combining
our sample with the literature velocity-resolved lags, we find that the
symmetric velocity-resolved lags are the most common (40%) type among this

  spatially-resolved graveyards in MaNGA/SDSS-IV galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Claudia Maraston, Marco Limongi, Justus Neumann, Lorenzo Roberti, Alessandro Chieffi, Daniel Thomas, Jianhui Lian</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 14 figures, MNRAS in press, models and modelled data available at:this https URL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We update our stellar population models for the time evolution of the number
and mass of massive remnants - neutron stars and black holes - with a new
initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae. The
calculations are based on hydrodynamical simulations and induced explosions of
a subset of previously published pre-supernovae models spanning a wide range of
stellar mass, metallicity and different values for rotation velocity. The
resulting stellar population models predict lower numbers of neutron stars (by
up to 0.3 dex) and higher numbers of black holes (by up to 0.8 dex), especially
when stellar rotation is considered. The mass fraction locked in neutron stars
and black holes is lowest in high-metallicity populations, with the largest
number of remnants found at about half-solar metallicity. This mirrors the
amount of available gas, ranging from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. We then apply
our new models to IFU spectra for ~10,000 galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA
survey for which we previously published spatially-resolved star formation
histories. This allows us to probe spatially-resolved graveyards in galaxies of
different types. The number and radial distribution of remnants depend on a
galaxy's mass, star formation history and metal content. More massive and hence
more metal-rich galaxies are found to host fewer remnants. Radial gradients in
the number of remnants depend on galaxy mass mostly because of the
mass-dependent profiles in mass density: the gradients are flat in low-mass
galaxies, and negative in high-mass galaxies, particularly in Milky Way
analogues.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15060v1" target="_blank"><h2>SYMPHANY- SYnergy of Molecular PHase And Neutral hYdrogen in galaxies in

spatially resolved galaxies in the A2626 cluster (z = 0.055), observed as part
of the SYMPHANY project. Using CO(2-1) observations from ALMA and SMA, together
with HI data from MeerKAT, we examine the interplay between gas phases and
environmental influences. A joint morphological and kinematic analysis reveals
that while the kinematic behavior of HI and CO are often similar,
morphologically the atomic gas is more extended compared to centrally
concentrated CO distributions, making it more susceptible to environmental
stripping. However, we also find evidence for molecular gas asymmetries,
disturbed velocity fields, and H2 deficiencies in some galaxies, indicating
that H2 reservoirs can also be disrupted in dense environments. Compared to
Virgo-a dynamically unrelaxed, non-cool-core cluster-A2626's relaxed, cool-core
structure likely results in less intense ram-pressure stripping. This may allow
galaxies to retain more atomic gas, while local interactions or pre-processing
may still affect the molecular phase, causing relatively low HI deficiencies
but high H2 deficiencies in A2626 galaxies. This is also reflected in the
higher gas fractions, slightly elevated SFRs, along with shorter depletion
timescales (0.3-3 Gyr), implying moderately enhanced star formation efficiency
A2626 galaxies. Moreover, the lack of correlation between H2 deficiency and
cluster-centric distance or velocity suggests that molecular gas evolution in
A2626 may be shaped more by early infall or local interactions than by current
cluster location.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15789v1" target="_blank"><h2>CMB Lensing Trispectrum as a Probe of Parity Violation in LSS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alessandro Greco, Zachary Slepian, Jiamin Hou, Alex Krolewski</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 44 pages, 15 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing trispectrum is

compact expression for the reduced lensing trispectrum that is general for any
input matter trispectrum. We then present as an example a simple
parity-violating toy model for the latter, and explicitly compute the
parity-odd lensing trispectrum, including an estimate of the Signal-to-Noise

studies of more physically motivated models can be conducted. It also provides
an intuitive physical explanation of why CMB lensing is sensitive to parity.
Our work is the first to point out that secondary CMB anisotropies can be used
to probe parity in LSS, and will be important in enabling upcoming experiments
such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 to contribute maximal power on parity

recombination line (H110a) emission in 215 molecular clouds from the Bolocam
Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), observed using the Nanshan 25-m radio telescope.
H2CO was detected in 88 sources (40.93 percent) with 59 being new detections,
while H110a emission was found in only 11 sources (5.12 percent), all
coincident with H2CO absorption. There exists a correlation of H2CO fluxes with
millimeter fluxes below a 3 Jy threshold and an increased dispersion above it,
suggesting the sub-CMB cooling of H2CO. Cross-matching with kinematic distance
catalogs revealed H2CO spanning galactocentric distances from 0.216 to 10.769
kpc, with column densities ranging from 7.82 x 10^11 to 6.69 x 10^14 cm-2. A
significant inverse correlation was observed between H2CO detection fraction
and galactocentric distance, suggesting enhanced star forming activity closer
to the Galactic Center. These findings challenge traditional Galactic Habitable
Zone (GHZ) models by demonstrating the presence of biogenic precursors in the
inner Galaxy, shielded within dense molecular clouds. Our results underscore
the importance of incorporating chemical tracers like H2CO, alongside physical
constraints, to refine the boundaries of the GHZ and advance the research of

stars within the self-gravitating region. These stars undergo high accretion
rates because of the dense environment of the active galactic nuclei (AGN)
accretion disk. The vorticity of the AGN disk may influence the ultimate mass
feeding rate toward the star. In our study, we simulate mass feeding rates onto
stars at different AGN disk thicknesses through 3D numerical models to explore
the relationship between feeding rates and the thermal mass of the star
($q_{\rm th}$), defined as the ratio of the star's Bondi radius to the AGN disk
thickness. Our findings indicate that disk shearing with angular momentum can
notably decrease the feeding rate, and we provide an approximate formula that
links the feeding rate based on the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and
the thermal mass $q_{\rm th}$. Lastly, we examine the potential feedback of the
rapidly accreting stars on the AGN disk and their subsequent evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15819v1" target="_blank"><h2>Selection of optically variable active galactic nuclei via a random

A defining characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that
distinguishes them from other astronomical sources is their stochastic
variability, which is observable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Upcoming optical wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's
Legacy Survey of Space and Time, are set to transform astronomy by delivering
unprecedented volumes of data for time domain studies. This data influx will
require the development of the expertise and methodologies necessary to manage
and analyze it effectively. Aims. This project focuses on optimizing AGN
selection through optical variability in wide-field surveys and aims to reduce
the bias against obscured AGN. We tested a random forest (RF) algorithm trained
on various feature sets to select AGN. The initial dataset consisted of 54
observations in the r-band and 25 in the g-band of the COSMOS field, captured
with the VLT Survey Telescope over a 3.3-year baseline. Methods. Our analysis
relies on feature sets derived separately from either band plus a set of
features combining data from both bands, mostly characterizing AGN on the basis
of their variability properties and obtained from their light curves. We
trained multiple RF classifiers using different subsets of selected features
and assessed their performance via targeted metrics. Results. Our tests provide
valuable insights into the use of multiband and multivisit data for AGN
identification. We compared our findings with previous studies and dedicated
part of the analysis to potential enhancements in selecting obscured AGN. The
expertise gained and the methodologies developed here are readily applicable to
datasets from other ground- and space-based missions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15066v1" target="_blank"><h2>Star formation at different stages of ram-pressure stripping as observed

Tandon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping develop gaseous tails that can
extend several kiloparsecs outside the galaxy disc. We used far-ultraviolet and
H$\alpha$ imaging from the GASP survey to investigate how different stages of
stripping affect star formation properties in the tail and disc of 13 galaxies
undergoing stripping. These galaxies have different stripping strengths, as
identified from the MUSE integral field spectroscopy. The star-forming knots in
the disc and tails show a good correspondence between the measured FUV and
H$\alpha$ flux. This is especially true for strong and extreme cases of
stripping, which have developed extended ionized gaseous tails featuring clumpy
structures. The mechanism behind the H$\alpha$ emission on the tails of these
regions, which correlates well with FUV emission, is photoionization caused by
young massive stars. The optical emission line ratio maps enable us to
understand the emission mechanism, which can be attributed to star formation,
LINER activity, or a combination of both phenomena and AGN. The star-forming
regions in the emission line maps correspond well to the areas with significant
FUV flux in these galaxies. Six galaxies exhibit minimal star formation in
their tails, with two cases star formation is limited to the central regions
and their discs are truncated. In galaxies with truncated discs, star formation
is confined to a smaller region on the disc, as indicated by the FUV flux,
compared to H$\alpha$. Galaxies with strong stripping are undergoing recent
star formation and are likely recent infalls. Galaxies with truncated discs
confine star formation to the center, likely because they have completed a
cluster crossing that depleted most of their outer gaseous disc. Galaxies with
minimal FUV flux along their tails exhibit unresolved H$\alpha$ emission which
may be attributed to processes other than star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15550v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Sagittarius stellar stream embedded in a fermionic dark matter halo</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Santiago Collazo, Martín F. Mestre, Carlos R. Argüelles</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar streams are essential tracers of the gravitational potential of the
Milky Way, with key implications to the problem of dark matter (DM) model
distributions, either within or beyond phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos. For
the first time in the literature, a DM halo model based on first physical
principles such as quantum statistical mechanics and thermodynamics is used to
try to reproduce the 6D observations of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream. We model
both DM haloes, the one of Sgr dwarf and the one of its host with a spherical
self-gravitating system of neutral fermions which accounts for the effects of
particles escape and fermion degeneracy, the latter causing a high-density core
at the center of the halo. Full baryonic components for each galaxy are also
considered. We use a spray algorithm with $\sim 10^{5}$ particles to generate
the Sgr tidal debris, which evolves in the gravitational potential of the
host-progenitor system, to compare with the full phase-space data of the
stream. We repeat this kind of simulations for different parameter setups of
the fermionic model including the particle mass, with special attention to test
different DM halo morphologies allowed by the physics. We find that across the
different families of fermionic halo models, they can only reproduce the
trailing arm of the Sgr stream. Within the observationally allowed span of
enclosed masses where the stream moves, neither the power-law like, nor the
polytropic behaviour of the fermionic halo models can answer for the observed
trend of the leading tail. A conclusion which is shared by former analysis
using other type of spherically symmetric haloes. We conclude that further
model sophistications such as abandoning spherical symmetry and including the
Large Magellanic Cloud perturber are needed for a proper modelisation of the
overall Milky Way potential within this kind of first principle halo models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15339v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of broad emission lines from double-peaked to single-peaked to

central Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), the outer boundary increased with time of
the disk-like broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion
disk will lead expected broad emission lines changed from double-peaked to
single-peaked. Considering common elliptical orbitals for the accreting
fallback TDEs debris, based on simulated results through the preferred standard
elliptical accretion disk model, a probability about 3.95\% can be estimated
for cases with double-peaked profile changed to single-peaked profile in
multi-epoch broad emission lines, indicating such unique profile variability
could be indicator for BLRs related to TDE debris. Meanwhile, among the
reported optical TDE candidates with apparent broad lines, such profile changes
in broad H$\alpha$ can be found in the AT 2018hyz. After accepted the outer
boundaries of the disk-like BLRs increased with time, the observed multi-epoch
broad H$\alpha$ can be described in AT 2018hyz. Moreover, the elliptical
accretion disk model determined time dependent ratios of the outer boundaries
of the disk-like BLRs are well consistent with the TDE model expected ratios of
the outer boundaries of the fallback TDE debris. Furthermore, the evolution
properties of disk-like BLRs can be applied to estimate the locations of the
disk-like BLRs of which outer boundary could be about one sixth of the outer
boundary of the fallback TDE debris in AT 2018hyz. Such unique profile changes
from double-peaked to single-peaked could be applied as further clues to
support a central TDE.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15645v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring future synergies for large-scale structure between

sets of cosmological tracers. These include mapping the large-scale
distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) using intensity mapping (IM), HI galaxies
and radio continuum galaxies. In this work, we will investigate synergies
between gravitational waves (GW) and radio tracers through a multi-tracer
approach. We first forecast the precision on the clustering bias of GWs by
cross-correlating data from an ET-like detector with an SKAO IM survey. Our
results indicate that this approach can constrain the GW clustering bias to
within $2\%$ up to $z = 2.5$. Additionally, we explore the potential of a
triple cross-correlation using GWs, IM, and photometric galaxies from a survey
like LSST. This multi-tracer method enhances constraints on the magnification
lensing effect, achieving percent-level precision, and allows for a measurement
of the Doppler effect with approximately $15\%$ uncertainty. Furthermore we
show for the first time that this method could achieve the precision required
to measure subdominant gravitational potential contributions to the
relativistic corrections, which had thought to be below cosmic variance. Our
analysis highlights the potential of cross-correlations between GWs and radio
tracers to improve constraints on astrophysical properties of BBHs, measure
relativistic effects, and perform null tests of GR in cosmological scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15226v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparison of simulations and semi-analytical model for WDM subhalo mass

formation, but challenges remain at smaller scales, leading to interest in Warm
Dark Matter (WDM) as an alternative. The abundance of Milky Way subhalos
depends on the mass of WDM particles, allowing constraints to be obtained by
comparing observations and theoretical models. However, high-resolution
simulations of heavier WDM particle masses are computationally demanding,
making semi-analytical approaches valuable. In this study, we evaluate the
ability of the Semi-Analytical Sub-Halo Inference Modeling for WDM (SASHIMI-W)
to reproduce subhalo mass functions for heavier WDM particle masses. We perform
high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations for CDM and WDM with particle
masses of 1 keV, 3 keV, and 10 keV, and compare the ratio of the subhalo mass
function between WDM and CDM cases. Our results show that SASHIMI-W
successfully reproduces the simulation results over redshifts z = 0 to z = 2.
Furthermore, both simulations and the semi-analytical model show a slight
redshift dependence in the subhalo suppression ratio. However, a direct
comparison of the differential subhalo mass functions shows discrepancies in
the mid- and low-mass regions, suggesting that the tidal stripping effects
implemented in SASHIMI-W may be too strong for WDM subhalos, or that the
removal of spurious subhalos in the simulations is insufficient. These results
validate the use of SASHIMI-W in constraining WDM properties, and highlight the

  CMB Temperature and Anisotropies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yousef Bisabr</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, no figure</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Hubble tension, as a persistent discrepancy between early-time and
late-time measurements of the Hubble constant, motivates explorations of new
physics in the early Universe. In a recent early dark energy (EDE) model, we
introduced a scalar field interacting with the radiation sector at early-time
before recombination. We showed that such a scalar-photon coupling can lead to
an accelerated expansion phase in which the energy density of scalar component
dilutes faster than
  radiation does, a crucial feature for a successful EDE model. In the present
work, we extend our analysis to investigate how this scalar-photon coupling
affects the CMB temperature-redshift law and CMB anisotropies. We demonstrate
that the temperature-redshift law deviates from the standard relation
$T(z)\propto (1+z)$ due to the scalar-photon coupling. This deviation is
controlled by a model parameter $\epsilon$, which quantifies the rate of energy
transfer between the scalar field and radiation. We also argue that a positive
value of $\epsilon$ shifts the acoustic peaks to larger scales, which
potentially alleviates the Hubble tension. These findings suggest that
scalar-photon coupling is a testable mechanism for reconciling different
cosmological observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15028v1" target="_blank"><h2>Analyzing Stellar and Interstellar Contributions to Polarization:
  Modeling Approaches for Hot Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R Ignace, A G Fullard, G V Panopoulou, D J Hillier, C Erba, P A Scowen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> to appear in Astrophysics and Space Science</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Linear polarimetry of unresolved stars is a powerful method for discerning or
constraining the geometry of a source and its environment, since spherical
sources produce no net polarization. However, a general challenge to
interpreting intrinsic stellar polarization is the contribution to the signal
by interstellar polarization (ISP). Here, we review methodologies for
distinguishing the stellar signal from the interstellar contribution in the
context of massive stars. We first characterize ISP with distance using a
recent compilation of starlight polarization catalogs. Several scenarios
involving Thomson scattering, rapidly rotating stars, optically thick winds,
and interacting binaries are considered specifically to contrast the
wavelength-dependent effects of ISP in the ultraviolet versus optical bands.
ISP is recognizable in the stellar polarization from Thomson scattering in the
polarization position angle rotations. For hot stars with near-critical
rotation rates, the ISP declines whereas the stellar continuum polarization
sharply increases. In the case of quite dense winds, strong ultraviolet lines
trace the ISP, which is not always the case in the optical. In the binary case,
temporal and chromatic effects illustrate how the ISP displaces variable
polarization with wavelength. This study clarifies the impacts of ISP in
relation to new ultraviolet spectropolarimetry efforts such as Polstar and
Pollux.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15764v1" target="_blank"><h2>Direct Detection of Cosmic Walls with Paleo Detectors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wen Yin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20pages, 11figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Paleo detectors are emerging dark matter detection technology that exploits
ancient minerals as passive, time-integrated detectors. Unlike conventional
real-time experiments, they search for permanent damage tracks-typically tens
of nanometers to micrometers long-left in crystal lattices by rare particle
interactions, most notably dark matter induced nuclear recoils accumulated over
millions to billions of years. In this paper I propose a direct detection
strategy for cosmic walls-either bubble walls produced by a late-time
first-order phase transition or domain walls in a scaling regime-using paleo
detectors as the target medium. Because the cosmic wall is expected to traverse
Earth at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time(s) in cosmic history, an ancient,
continuously exposed detector is the only feasible way to observe it directly.
By calculating the target recoils, I find that the smoking-gun signature would
be parallel damage tracks found worldwide in minerals older than the
wall-crossing epoch. I derive the limit on the wall-target coupling by assuming
that a wall passed through the Earth within the last 0.5 Gyr. I also mention a
novel indirect detection of ultra-relativistic cosmic walls by noting the
induced cosmic rays.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15768v1" target="_blank"><h2>Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light
  model through the cosmic distance duality relation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jaiane Santos, Carlos Bengaly, Rodrigo S. Gonçalves</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on
testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks
such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the
relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular
diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation
(CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv
D_{\text{L}}(z)/D_{\text{A}}(z) = (1+z)^{2}$, making it a powerful probe of a
potential variation of such a fundamental constant. Hence, we test the
viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$
measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES
and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type
Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed
on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same
redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\sigma$
confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined
together, as well as when considering SNe with 3D BAO only. However, when SNe
and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim
4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently
discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in
addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually.
Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL
model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</p></br></body>
