galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy
formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible
explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows
that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we
analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing
galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering
the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations
and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find
that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50
km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the
configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo
populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s
(p<0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where
globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and
axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5
kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits
measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This
interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as
preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion
could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive
galaxies observed by JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04517v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing dust torus radius--luminosity relation: An WISE view</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ashutosh Tomar, Suvendu Rakshit, Amit Kumar Mandal, Shivangi Pandey</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (title, abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), time-domain (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present measurements of the dusty torus sizes of 51 active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) with a redshift of $z<$ 0.8. Our analysis utilizes about 16 years of
optical photometric data of 146 AGNs from various time-domain surveys,
including ASAS-SN, CRTS, and ZTF, along with 14 years of infrared data in the
$W$1 ($\sim$ 3.4 $\mu$m) and $W$2 ($\sim$ 4.6 $\mu$m) bands obtained from the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The estimated dust torus size
ranges from 1000 to 3000 days, using both the cross-correlation analysis and
lightcurve modeling through `MICA'. The measured lag has been corrected by
$(1+z)^{-0.37}$, to account for cosmological time dilation and the torus
temperature-gradient scaling. We conduct a linear regression analysis for both
the $W$1 and $W$2 bands to examine the radius--luminosity ($R$--$L_{BOL}$)
relationship under two conditions: one where the slope is fixed at 0.5 and one
where it is allowed to vary. For the fixed slope of 0.5, we find the ratio of
R$_{\mathrm{BLR}}$: R$_{W1}$: R$_{W2}$ to be 1: 9: 12, indicating that the
torus lies outside the BLR and that its size increases with wavelength.
Furthermore, we determine the relationship between torus size and L$_{BOL}$,
yielding best-fit slopes of $0.413\pm0.047$ for the $W$1 band and
$0.397\pm0.058$ for the $W$2 band. Both slopes are shallower than predicted by
the dust radiation equilibrium model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that
the torus size systematically decreases as the Eddington ratio increases, a
trend that can be explained by the self-shadowing effects of slim disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03400v1" target="_blank"><h2>H I Properties of Field Galaxies at $\boldsymbol{z\approx 0.2}$-0.6:

intermediate-redshift ($z\approx0.2$-0.6) galaxies. By leveraging
multi-sightline galaxy survey data from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey
(CUBS) and deep radio observations from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey
(MALS), we have established a sample of $\approx6000$ spectroscopically
identified galaxies in 11 distinct fields to constrain the neutral gas content
at intermediate redshifts. The galaxies sample a broad range in stellar mass --
$8\lesssim\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\lesssim11$ with a median of
$\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle_\rm{med}\approx10$ -- and a wide

significance in the stacked spectra of all subsamples, and the observed total H
I 21-cm line flux translates to a H I mass
$M_\rm{H\;I}\approx10^{10}\rm{M}_\odot$. We find a high H I-to-stellar mass
ratio of $M_\mathrm{H\;I}/M_\rm{star}\approx6$ for low-mass galaxies with
$\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle \approx9.3$ ($>3.7\,\sigma$). For

find $M_\mathrm{H\;I}/M_\rm{star}\approx0.3$ ($>4.7\,\sigma$). Additionally,
the redshift evolution of H I mass in both low- and high-mass field galaxies,
inferred from the stacked emission-line signal, aligns well with the
expectation from the cosmic star formation history. This suggests that the
overall decline in the cosmic star formation activity across the general galaxy
population may be connected to a decreasing supply of neutral hydrogen.
Finally, our analysis has revealed significant 21-cm signals at distances
greater than 75 kpc from these intermediate-redshift galaxies, indicating a
substantial reservoir of H I gas in their extended surroundings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05067v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectral Properties of Anomalous Microwave Emission in 144 Galactic

to arise from spinning dust grains, yet remains poorly understood. We analyze
AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3
GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using
aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without
informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral
width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than
previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally
broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the
interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along
the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution
in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical
predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude
correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing
$\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency
in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases
with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not
reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution
and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental
parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with
AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a
log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum
across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04733v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multiwavelength continuum, emission line and BAL variability with

peculiar broad-absorption-line quasar based on UV HST spectra. We took
simultaneous deep X-ray observations of PG0043+039 with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR,
UV spectra with the HST, and optical spectra with the HET telescope in 2022.
PG0043+039 was an extreme low-X-ray-luminosity quasar in 2022. This AGN showed
an extreme steep alpha_oX value of -2.47. The X-ray luminosity was a factor of
3.4 higher in the meantime in 2013. The optical and UV continuum only decreased
by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 from 2013 to 2022. Very strong emission-line intensity
variations by factors of eight or more were observed in the OVI_1038 and
SiIV_1403 lines between 2013 and 2022. The other UV emission lines such as
Ly_alpha only decreased by a factor of 1.4. We derived a black hole mass of
M=6.95*10^{8} M_solar (based on H_beta). This corresponds to an Eddington ratio
of L/L_edd = 0.115. PG0043+039 exhibits strong and broad absorption lines in
the UV. The highly ionized absorption lines show the largest velocity
blueshifts in their broad absorption lines. The PV absorption is very strong,
with equivalent widths of 7 - 10 AA. PG0043+039 shows strong Ly_alpha emission
despite strong PV absorption. All the strong absorption-line troughs in the UV
varied in unison in velocity space back and forward (-2000.+-300.kms-1,
+2740.+-200.kms-1) without any major changes in absorption strength or in their
profiles for the years 1991, 2013, and 2022. We found no general correlations
of X-ray/opt/UV continuum variations with the broad absorption line variations.
However, based on the simultaneous UV and X-ray observations - taken in 2013
and 2022 - we see higher maximum velocities of the blueshifted broad absorption
lines in the UV when the X-ray flux was lower.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04429v1" target="_blank"><h2>High energy gamma-ray sources in the VVV survey - III. Spectroscopic

candidate counterpart to the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGLJ1812.8-3144.
This object was selected based on its near-infrared photometric properties and
moderate variability, as part of a broader effort to identify active galactic
nuclei (AGN) behind the Galactic bulge and disc. We obtained near-infrared
spectra using the Flamingos-2 instrument at Gemini South, covering the $1.1
$--$ 1.8~\mu$m range with a spectral resolution of $R \sim 1200$. Standard data
reduction procedures were applied, including telluric correction and wavelength
calibration. The analysis focused on the identification of emission lines and
the estimation of the redshift using cross-correlation techniques and spectral
template fitting. Despite a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the spectrum
reveals the presence of Pa$\beta$ and Fe\,\textsc{ii} emission lines. The
measured redshift is $z = 0.206 \pm 0.001$, which confirms the extragalactic
nature of the source. The spectral features such as line ratios and full width
at half maximum are consistent with those typically observed in type-1 AGNs,
particularly Seyfert 1 galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of
near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal AGNs that are obscured by highly extincted
and crowded galactic fields. The confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic
latitude ($b\sim -6.5${\deg}) shows that near-IR surveys like VVV can
successfully penetrate the zone of avoidance. Extending this approach to
additional candidates is crucial for improving the census of AGNs hidden behind
the Milky Way, as well as for constraining the population of unassociated
gamma-ray sources in these troublesome regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03716v1" target="_blank"><h2>A systematic study on the properties of aromatic and aliphatic

appreciable amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in the harsh
environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the origins of which are still
under discussion. In this paper, we analyze the near-IR spectra of AGNs
obtained with AKARI to systematically study the properties of the aromatic and
aliphatic hydrocarbon dust a ected by the AGN activity. We perform the spectral
fitting and the spectral energy distribution fitting for our sample of 102 AGNs
to obtain the fluxes of the aromatic and aliphatic spectral features, the total
IR luminosity (L_IR), and the fractional luminosity of AGN components
(L_AGN/L_IR). As a result, we find that L_aromatic/L_IR is systematically lower
for the AGN sample, especially much lower for AGNs with the aliphatic feature
seen in the absorption, than for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), while
L_aliphatic/L_aromatic is systematically higher for the AGN sample than for the
SFG sample, increasing with the AGN activity indicated by L_AGN/L_IR. In
addition, the profiles of the aliphatic emission features of the AGN sample are
significantly di erent from those of the SFG sample in that the AGNs have the
feature intensities systematically stronger at longer wavelengths. We conclude
that both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust are likely of circumnuclear
origins, suggesting that a significant amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon dust
may come from a new population created through processes such as shattering of
large carbonaceous grains by AGN outflows.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04709v1" target="_blank"><h2>Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined $Λ$CDM Halo

unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a
significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In
this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous
high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by
revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo
mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that
incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent
collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of
massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST)
formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity,
we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from
$z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model
requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST
overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from
oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical
role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02879v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust scattering halo of 4U 1630-47: High resolution X-ray and mm

analyzing its dust scattering halo (DSH) using high-resolution X-ray (Chandra)
and millimeter (APEX) observations. Dust scattering halos form when X-rays from
a compact source are scattered by interstellar dust, creating diffuse ring-like
structures that can provide clues about the source's distance. Our previous
work suggested two possible distances: 4.9 kpc and 11.5 kpc, but uncertainties
remained due to low-resolution CO maps. We developed a new methodology to
refine these estimates, starting with a machine learning approach to determine
a 3D representation of molecular clouds from the APEX dataset. The 3D maps are
combined with X-ray flux measurements to generate synthetic DSH images. By
comparing synthetic images with the observed Chandra data through radial and
azimuthal profile fitting, we not only measure the source distance but also
distinguish whether the molecular clouds are at their near or far distances.
The current analysis again supported a distance of 11.5 kpc over alternative
estimates. While the method produced a lower reduced chi-squared for both the
azimuthal and radial fits for a distance of 13.6 kpc, we ruled it out as it
would have produced a bright ring beyond the APEX field of view, which is not
seen in the Chandra image. The 4.85 kpc estimate was also excluded due to poor
fit quality and cloud distance conflicts. The systematic error of 1 kpc,
arising from uncertainties in determining molecular cloud distances, dominates
the total error.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02801v1" target="_blank"><h2>A $z\simeq0.4$ Little Red Dot analog: An Extended Starburst with an

red sources at z > 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs).
Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key
phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe.
Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace
their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been
spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe.
Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs,
J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS
IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The
GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation
rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow.
This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and
outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding
the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an
extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH
mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 Msun,
respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the
implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of
high-z LRDs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04416v1" target="_blank"><h2>Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the

pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they
currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos
at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could
plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy
evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0
observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of
443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation.
We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar
mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched
(with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with
varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed
galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more
extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of
their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the
control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of
UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star
formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The
low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed
galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent
JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high
globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these
failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark
matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the
fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental
density.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02805v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational lensing by a spiral galaxy I: the influence from bar's

mass structures within lens galaxies. These anomalies are often attributed to
dark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a
significant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common
feature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic
analysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga
cosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of
these galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields
smooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating
numerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the
flux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical
cusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars,
we use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region.
Our primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between
the magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even
Fourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole
components show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with
Spearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order
of 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are
highly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We
conclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic
bar's complex morphology. Failing to account for a bar's complex morphology can
lead to a misinterpretation of the lensing signature, potentially causing an
overestimation of the dark matter subhalo population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02751v1" target="_blank"><h2>Self-lensing binaries in globular clusters -- predictions for ELT</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Grzegorz Wiktorowicz, Matthew Middleton, Mirek Giersz, Adam Ingram, Adam McMaster, Abbas Askar, Lucas Hellström</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Self-lensing (SL) represents a powerful technique for detecting compact

environments, utilizing synthetic stellar populations from MOCCA simulations to
predict detection rates for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our analysis
incorporates finite-size lens effects for white dwarf (WD) lenses and the
specific observational characteristics of the ELT/MICADO instrument. We find
that present-day GCs contain 1-50 SL sources with magnifications
$\mu_\mathrm{sl} > 1+10^{-8}$, strongly dependent on initial binary fraction,
with systems dominated by WD lenses paired with low-mass main-sequence
companions. The predicted populations exhibit characteristic bimodal magnitude
distributions with peaks at $m \approx 24$ and 32 mag at 10 kpc distance, and
typical Einstein ring crossing times of $\tau_\mathrm{eff} \sim 2$ hours. ELT
observations should achieve detection efficiency of 0.015-10 sources in
$\sim150$ nearby GC after a year of observations depending on distance and
survey strategy, with nearby clusters ($D \lesssim 10$ kpc) offering the
highest yields. Multi-year monitoring campaigns with daily cadence provide
order-of-magnitude improvements over single observations through enhanced
photometric precision and increased detection probability. Our results
demonstrate that coordinated ELT surveys of Galactic GCs represent a viable
approach for probing hidden binary populations and compact object demographics
in dense stellar environments, with comprehensive programs potentially yielding
up to 10-100 well-characterized SL sources after first 5 years of observations
suitable for statistical studies of binary evolution in extreme environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03229v1" target="_blank"><h2>Robust magnetic field estimates in star-forming galaxies with the

from synchrotron intensity in radio galaxies, yet the validity of its
underlying assumptions remains uncertain. Using an Arepo simulation which
incorporates a two-moment cosmic ray (CR) transport scheme and a multiphase
interstellar medium, we compare magnetic fields inferred from synthetic
synchrotron emission maps with the true fields in the simulation. Starting from
the derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between
the equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only
weakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density. In practice, for
both face-on and edge-on projections, the equipartition model slightly
overestimates the total synchrotron-weighted magnetic field with mean offsets
of 32% (0.17 dex) and 36% (0.2 dex), even though the energy equipartition does
not hold locally. Beyond these average offsets, a clear trend emerges in
edge-on projections that the model underestimates the field in the disk and
overestimates it in the halo. Our results demonstrate that the validity of the
equipartition model depends only weakly on the strict fulfillment of energy
equipartition, and that the equipartition model remains a practical method for
estimating magnetic field strengths in face-on projection maps based on our
CR-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05037v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the sensitivity of different galaxy properties to warm dark matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Belén Costanza, Bonny Y.

coupled with a normalizing flow to explore global statistical descriptors of
galaxy populations, such as the mean, standard deviation, and histograms of 14
galaxy properties. We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative
feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of
R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable
relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized
approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating
subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as
graph-level features. The GNN approach yields only a residual improvement over
MLP models based solely on global features, indicating that most of the
predictive power resides in the global descriptors, with only marginal gains
from halo-level information.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03552v1" target="_blank"><h2>Woven by the Whirls: The growth and entrainment of cold clouds in

cold dense gas and the hot diffuse medium. Such multiphase flows -- involving
gas at different temperatures, densities, and ionization states -- for
instance, galactic winds, are frequently turbulent. However, idealized
simulations typically model the winds and driven turbulence separately, despite
their intertwined roles in galaxy evolution. To address this, we investigate
the survival of a dense cloud in a hot wind subject to continuous external
turbulent forcing. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations across a range of
turbulent Mach numbers in the hot phase $\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}=v_{\rm
turb}/c_{\rm s, wind}$ from 0.1 to 0.7 ($c_{\rm s, wind}$ and $v_{\rm turb}$
being the sound speed and the turbulent velocity in the hot phase,
respectively). We find that in spite of the additional subsonic turbulence,
cold clouds can survive if the cooling time of the mixed gas $t_{\rm cool,
mix}$ is shorter than a modified destruction time $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}$, i.e.,
$t_{\rm cool,mix}/\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}<1$ where $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}=t_{\rm
cc}/(1+\left(\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}/\left(f_{\rm mix}\mathcal{M}_{\rm
wind}\right)\right)^2)^{1/2}$, where $f_{\rm mix}\sim0.6$ is a fudge factor.
Moreover, in the `survival regime', turbulence can enhance the growth of cold
clouds by up to an order of magnitude because of more efficient stretching and
an associated increase in the surface area. This increase in mass transfer
between the phases leads to significantly faster entrainment of cold material
in turbulent winds. In contrast to the narrow filamentary tails formed in
laminar winds, turbulence stretches the cold gas orthogonally, dispersing it
over a larger area and changing absorption line signatures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02736v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the Low Radio Frequency Emission in PG Quasars with the uGMRT --

the Palomar Green (PG) quasar sample with $z<0.5$. Radio emission is detected
in all sources except for 3 radio-quiet (RQ) sources, viz., PG 0043+039, PG
1121+422, and PG 1552+085. The radio-loud (RL) $-$ RQ dichotomy persists at 685
MHz with only 1 source, PG 1216+069, changing its classification from RQ to RL.
Approximately 1/3 of the detected RQ quasars display AGN-dominated radio
emission while the rest may show additional contributions from stellar-related
processes. Consistent with this, the RL and RQ quasars occupy distinct tracks
on the `fundamental plane' of black hole activity. We find that RL quasars have
$\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1}) > 25.5$, while RQ quasars
have ${\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1})} <23.5$.
Furthermore, the radio sizes display the RQ$-$RL divide as well with RQ sources
typically having sizes $\lesssim30$ kpc, with only 16 ($\sim22$%) RQ sources
having sizes between 30 and 100 kpc where there is an overlap with RL quasar
sizes. A strong correlation exists between 685 MHz radio luminosity and black
hole mass which is tightened when accretion rate is considered, highlighting
the important role played by the accretion rate and accretion disk structure in
jet production. We found no difference in the minimum-energy magnetic field
strengths of the radio cores of RL and RQ quasars; however, different
assumptions of source volume and volume filling factors may apply.
High-resolution X-ray observations and radio-X-ray flux comparisons are needed
to independently test the `magnetic flux paradigm'.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04998v1" target="_blank"><h2>Doubly Discordant SH0ES NGC4258 Cepheid Relations (HVI), and Impactful

well-studied sloshing cold fronts at radii of $r \approx 30$ kpc and $r \approx
90$ kpc, respectively. In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic
observations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \approx
250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely
to be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison
with a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these
cold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49
from the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the
south. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the
disturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness
profiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas
the western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies
that magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while
its western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the
X-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the
cold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our
findings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of
the intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important
implications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such
as the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing
ancient cold fronts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04523v1" target="_blank"><h2>Suzaku observations of outskirts of nearby clusters and groups: I.

and groups (z < 0.06), extending radial coverage out to the virial radius
(approximately r200). The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about
2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as
Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components,
including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and
super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the
non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of
the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission
measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with
radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near
r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core
regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while
groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500,
electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2.
At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight
correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright
subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and
approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass
systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass
dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play
an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection
between baryons and dark matter halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03221v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inferring Stellar Densities with Flexible Models I: The Distribution of

requires detailed mapping of its stellar components, which preserve fossil
records of the Galaxy's assembly through cosmic time. RR Lyrae stars are
particularly well-suited for this endeavor, as they are old, standard candle
variables that probe the Galaxy's earliest formation epochs. In this work, we
employ a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the
three-dimensional density distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way. This
approach provides a flexible framework for modeling complex stellar
distributions, particularly in the inner Galaxy where the bulge, disk, and halo
components overlap. Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by
a distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.30. Consistent with
previous work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that
flattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is
oblate ($q$=0.62) with a tilt angle of $12.22^{\circ}$. We report for the first
time that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results establish GMMs as an effective and
flexible tool for modeling Galactic structure and provide new constraints on
the distribution of old stars in the inner Galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03106v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the origin of counterrotating stellar disks in TNG50.

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Understanding galaxy evolution is key to explaining the structures we observe
in the present-day Universe. Counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs), i.e.
co-spatial stellar disks rotating with opposite angular momentum, have been
proposed as signatures of past accretion events. Therefore, they constitute
potentially valuable tracers of galactic assembly. We aim to investigate the
properties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass
galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central
late-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\rm tot} \approx 10^{12}$, $D/T>0.5$, $N_{\rm
star}>10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar
particles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity
$\epsilon < -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main
disk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star
formation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host
significant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\% of the total stellar mass of
the disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from
observations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\%),
in-situ dominated (i.e.73\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often
coincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations
are able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD's star
population is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways
can lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth
accretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare
but diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the
accretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow,
suggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy's past
accretion history.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03447v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA-IMF. XXI.: N$_2$H$^+$ kinematics in the G012.80 protocluster:

the dense and cold gas. Additionally, we use lines such as DCN(3$-$2),
H41$\alpha$, C$^{18}$O(1$-$0), and SiO(5$-$4), as well as continuum maps. We
perform a N$_2$H$^+$ hyperfine spectral line fitting to analyze multiple
velocity components and spectral parameters. We estimate velocity gradients,
column densities, and line-mass profiles for the two main filaments in G012,
named R1 and R2. Line-mass profiles follow $\lambda$($\omega$) = 5660
M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.30}$ (R1) and $\lambda$($\omega$) = 6943
M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.20}$ (R2), which are much larger than
those of typical low-mass filaments. R1 and R2 show disparate position-velocity
(PV) features. R1 exhibits a transverse velocity gradient of 10.4 kms$^{-1}
$pc$^{-1}$ and few dense cores. This gradient is interpreted with a simple
rotation toy model, combined with line-mass profile, and corresponds to a
rotational timescale of 0.1 Myr. In contrast, R2 exhibits compact velocity
structures ($\Delta$V < 2 kms$^{-1}$), likely due to collapse, as evidenced by
the presence of a comparatively large number of massive cores and protostellar
outflows. R2 is forming prestellar and protostellar cores at a rate of 55.3
M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with an efficiency similar to the Orion Integral Shaped
Filament (ISF). The R1 filament, in contrast, lacks protostellar cores and only
contains a few prestellar cores, resulting in an estimated SFR of 4.2
M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, more than an order of magnitude below that of R2.
Combining these lines of evidence, we suggest that R1 is younger and still
rotating, while R2 has evolved to collapse with a higher SFR. G012 thus hosts
filaments at different evolutionary stages.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04771v1" target="_blank"><h2>A GLIMPSE into the very faint-end of the

to $10^{39}$ erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell
S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring
combined H$\beta$+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The
resulting LF ($\alpha$=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF ($\alpha<-2$),
indicating a lower number density of low H$\beta$+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV.
We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the
H$\beta$+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/H$\beta$, or
(iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/H$\beta$
ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]$\lambda$5008 LF ($\alpha$=-1.45 to -1.66) and
a steeper H$\beta$ LF ($\alpha$=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing
metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and H$\beta$+[OIII]
LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we
find that galaxies with H$\alpha$ flux $>10^{39}$ erg/s
(SFR(H$\alpha$)$>5\times10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of
the ionising photon budget at 7<z<8 and 8<z<9, respectively (for
$f_{esc}=0.1$). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to
the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density
(CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low
SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the
ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE
has detected the bulk of the total H$\beta$+[OIII] emission from star-forming
galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03098v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deciphering the radio-star formation correlation on kpc scales. IV.

emission are produced within the thin disk and transported into the halo. We
made an attempt to reconstruct the radial properties of radio continuum halos
in nearly edge-on galaxies where the star formation rate (SFR) distribution can
be deprojected and the vertical radio continuum emission is well distinct from
the disk emission. The deprojected SFR distribution is convolved with a
Gaussian kernel to take CRe diffusion within the galactic disk into account and
a vertical profile of the radio continuum emissivity is added to the disk
emission. The three-dimensional emission distribution is then projected on the
sky and compared to VLA radio continuum observations at 20 and 6 cm. We found
that overall the halo emission contains information on the underlying
distribution of the star formation rate. The majority of our galaxies show
flaring radio continuum halos. Except for one galaxy, our Virgo galaxies follow
the trend of increasing effective height with increasing radio continuum size
found by the CHANG-ES collaboration. We confirm that radio continuum halos can
represent a significant fraction of the total radio continuum emission of a
starforming spiral galaxy. At 20 cm and 6 cm between 30 and 70 of the total
radio continuum emission originate in the halo. We propose a halo
classification based on the height ratio and SI between 20 and 6cm. If we
interpret the vertical structures of the large-scale magnetic field within the

very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray emission around PSR~B1055$-$52 using
observations from the H.E.S.S. array. This middle-aged pulsar, previously
grouped together with Geminga and PSR~B0656$+$14 as part of the ``Three

third detected system of its kind, and the first TeV pulsar halo discovered in
the southern hemisphere. Our analysis performed in an energy range of
$0.3-60\,$TeV, reveals gamma-ray emission with a one sigma extension of $(2.05

region which was observed with H.E.S.S.. No significant spectral variation is
detected across the emission.
  The diffusion coefficient derived for this halo is significantly lower than
the standard ISM value, aligning with findings in the Geminga halo and
indicating that slow diffusion may be a common property of pulsar halos. The
detection of this new TeV pulsar halo provides a crucial data point for
studying the population-wide properties of pulsar halos, their impact on
cosmic-ray propagation, and their role as a source of Galactic electrons and

properties of ionized gas and the effect of stellar feedback. Using emission
line data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized
Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the
principal optical emission line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous HII
region in M33. The excitation maps align well with the H$\alpha$ morphology and
are clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and
secondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show
substantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these
variations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily
caused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios.
We present the H$\alpha$ kinematics of the region and connect it to the
excitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial
distribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these
excitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary
nebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the
overall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution
spatial data. Throughout the paper, we make comparisons to and raise concerns
about single-aperture and long-slit spectroscopic measurements of giant HII
regions, highlighting the limitations and potential inaccuracies of such
methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04194v1" target="_blank"><h2>Azimuthal Misalignments in Stellar Warp Structure as Dynamical Tracers
  of Mergers in Milky Way-like Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lekshmi Thulasidharan, Elena D'Onghia, Robert Benjamin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the origin of warps in stellar disks using high-resolution
Milky Way analogs from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Focusing on galaxies that
experienced a major merger, we identify a characteristic azimuthal misalignment
between the warp structures of stellar populations formed before and after the
merger. This misalignment persists even after correcting for differential
rotation, suggesting it is a dynamical imprint of the merger rather than a
consequence of internal kinematics. In contrast, galaxies without significant
merger events show no such offset between stellar populations of different
ages. These findings support the scenario in which mergers can induce
long-lived warps and leave detectable structural signatures in stellar disks.
Applied to the Milky Way, this approach offers a potential way to test whether
the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger contributed to the formation of the Galactic
warp. It may also provide an independent means to constrain the timing of such
merger events by examining the phase offsets in the stellar warp as a function
of stellar age.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04977v1" target="_blank"><h2>Line emission search from DM annihilation in the Galactic Center with

Among various
candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands
out and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray
emission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of
electroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other
direct DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP
self-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other
Standard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative
proximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for
monoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM
properties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from
20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However,
the limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (< 3.5{\deg} )
prevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an
enhanced DM density is expected. The LST-1 of the CTAO, located at the Roque de
Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), close to the MAGIC site, has been
observing the GC since 2021. With its wide FoV of 4.5{\deg}, LST-1 could
contribute significantly to the WIMPs search at the GC. The observations are
performed at LZA (ZA > 58{\deg}), which, while required due to the source's low
altitude, also optimizes the detection of gamma rays up to 100 TeV and beyond.
We present a study of the systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission
searches with LST-1. Our work examines the instrument response functions for
LZA observations, background rejection in monoscopic mode, and includes updated
results from simulations, highlighting new methods for spectral line searches.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02832v1" target="_blank"><h2>A supermassive black hole under the radar: repeating X-ray variability

short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of
the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable
information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources
showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified
peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the
Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the
long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral
parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton}
observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that
J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on
typical timescales of $\simeq20-25$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found
hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux
states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the
ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs
($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic
X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow
for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However,
given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic
oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic
eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04570v1" target="_blank"><h2>Relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of supernova explosions within

Fichet de Clairfontaine</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Jets in active galactic nuclei have to cross significant distances within
their host galaxies, meeting large numbers of stars of different masses and
evolution stages in their paths. Given enough time, supernova explosions within
the jet will eventually happen, and may have a strong impact on its dynamics,
potentially triggering powerful non-thermal activity. We carried out a detailed
numerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta
of a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of
relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated
the jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a
two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which
includes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling
a region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually
covers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy
from the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which
also favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales ~ 10^4 yr.
Although a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given
the subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are
consistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical
properties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the
supernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet. The
results also suggest that the jet-ejecta interaction may be a non-negligible
non-thermal emitter. Moreover, due to efficient mixing, the interaction region
can be a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays of heavy
composition.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04599v1" target="_blank"><h2>Theoretical Modelling of Early Massive Black Holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Marta Volonteri</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> These notes follow as faithfully as possible what was presented at the 54th Saas-Fee Advanced Course "Galaxies and Black Holes in the First Billion Years as seen with the JWST'', held in January 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth

conducting precise and thorough observations of the X-ray sky for the past two
decades. The most recent iteration of the 4XMM catalogue and one of its latest
data releases DR11 mark significant improvements over previous XMM-Newton
catalogues, serving as a cornerstone for comprehending the diverse inhabitants
of the X-ray sky. We employ detections and spectra extracted from the 4XMM-DR11
catalogue, subjecting them to fitting procedures using simple models. Our study
operates within the framework of the XMM2ATHENA project, which focuses on
developing state-of-the-art methods that exploit existing XMM-Newton data. We
introduce and publicly release four catalogues containing measurements derived
from X-ray spectral modelling of sources. The first catalogue encompasses
outcomes obtained by fitting an absorbed power law model to all the extracted
spectra for individual detections within the 4XMM-DR11 dataset. The second
catalogue presents results obtained by fitting both an absorbed power law and
an absorbed blackbody model to all unique physical sources listed in the
4XMM-DR11s catalogue, which documents source detection results from overlapping
XMM-Newton observations. For the third catalogue we use the five band count
rates derived from the pipe line detection of X-ray sources to mimic low
resolution spectra to get a rough estimate of the spectral shape (absorbed
power-law) of all 4XMM-DR11 detections. In the fourth catalogue, we conduct
spectral analyses for the subset of identified sources with extracted spectra,
employing various models based on their classification into categories such as
AGN, stars, X-ray binaries, and cataclysmic variables. The scientific potential
of these catalogues is highlighted by discussing the capabilities of optical

frontier topic of research, with contemporary telescopes revealing intricate
features that require investigation. This study aims to examine the emission
characteristics of simulated GRGs, and correlate them with their underlying 3D
dynamical properties. Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz
were computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized
emissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to
reflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from
these RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different
locations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are
strongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features
like wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial
indicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in
GRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary
structures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr.
High-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon
distances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the
interpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the
lateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source's state, with a
gradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage. This study
highlights that applying a simple radio power-jet power relation to a
statistical GRG sample is unfeasible, as it depends on growth conditions of
individual GRGs. Effects such as inverse-Compton CMB cooling and matter
entrainment significantly impact the long-term emission persistence of GRGs.
The diminishing fractional polarization with GRG evolution reflects increasing
turbulence in the cocoon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02937v1" target="_blank"><h2>A quest for sulfur-bearing refractory species. Identification of CaS in

identifying refractory compounds containing sulfur could reveal potential
connections between sulfur and refractories, as well as help determine the
sulfur budget in these extreme environments. We find convincing evidence of a
reliable detection of CaS, and tentative detections of KS and KSH in the disk
G351.77-mm1. These are the first ever identifications of these species in the

  Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jonathan Mack, Shy Genel</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, accepted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Mergers are believed to play a pivotal role in galaxy evolution, and
measuring the galaxy merger fraction is a longstanding goal of both
observational and theoretical studies. In this work, we extend the
consideration of the merger fraction from the standard measure of binary
mergers, namely those comprising two merging galaxies, to multiple mergers,
namely mergers involving three or more galaxies. We use the Illustris and
IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to provide a theoretical
prediction for the fraction of galaxy systems that are involved in a multiple
merger as a function of various parameters, with a focus on the relationship
between the multiple merger fraction $f_m$ and the total merger fraction $f_t$.
We generally find that binary mergers dominate the total fraction and that
$f_m\approx (0.5-0.7)f_t^{5/3}$, a prediction that can be tested
observationally. We further compare the empirical simulation results with toy
models where mergers occur, on the evolution timeline of a galaxy, either at
constant intervals or as a Poisson process at a constant rate. From these
comparisons, where the toy models typically produce lower multiple merger
fractions, we conclude that in cosmological simulations, mergers are more
strongly clustered in time than in these toy scenarios, likely reflecting the
hierarchical nature of cosmological structure formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03139v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optimising the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array and towards precision pulsar

gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Recently, several PTAs have found evidence
for the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a
community-defined definitive (> 5$\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify
limiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs
under different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for
intrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar
Timing Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast
jitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the
timing precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter
noise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar
medium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a
stationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the
established hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing
potential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088\,MHz) of MeerKAT and find
a potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\approx 8$\%, relative to
observing at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the
propagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing
frequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present,
where noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the
improvement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers
and sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence
observations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both
the continuous GWs and stochastic GWB. These results highlight the role of
MeerKAT and the MPTA in the context of international GW search efforts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04328v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Role of Spiral Arms in Galaxies II: Similarities Amid Diversity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bingqing Sun, Daniela Calzetti, Andrew J.

efficiency or primarily act as material gatherers -- remains an open question.
Observational studies have yielded ambiguous results, in part due to the choice
of star formation rate (SFR) tracers and their inherent limitations. These
limitations are addressed here by applying multi-wavelength spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting to individual arm and interarm regions. We expand on
our previous study of two galaxies to include six diverse galaxies, spanning
over an order of magnitude in total stellar mass and factors of several in
total SFR, for which spiral arms have been mapped. We find that the specific
star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_{star}$) can be used as a proxy for the star
formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M$_{gas}$), since the two quantities are directly
proportional to each other in our regions. In our analysis of both tracers
(sSFR and SFE) no significant difference is found the between arm and interarm
regions, except for one galaxy (NGC 1097), supporting the gatherers scenario.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03410v1" target="_blank"><h2>Updated Radio Sigma-D Relation and Distances to the Shell-Like Galactic

use the obtained calibration to derive the distances to 164 Galactic SNRs and
27 new detected SNRs/SNR candidates with none or poor distance estimates. The

light (ICL), which is thought to be a promising tracer of the underlying dark
matter (DM) distribution. In this study, we employ the TNG300 simulation to
investigate the prospect of recovering the dark matter distribution of galaxy
clusters from deep, wide-field optical images. For this, we generate mock
observations of 40 massive clusters ($M_{200}\gtrsim 10^{14.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$)
at $z=0.06$ for the $g'$ band of the Wendelstein Wide-Field Imager (WWFI), and
isolate the emission from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL by
masking the satellite galaxies, following observational procedures. By
comparing $\Sigma_{\rm BCG+ICL}$ profiles from these images against
$\Sigma_{\rm DM}$ profiles for the central subhaloes, we find that $\Sigma_{\rm
cen-DM}/\Sigma_{\rm BCG+ICL}$ exhibits a quasi-linear scaling relation in log
space with the normalised distance $r/R_{\Delta}$, for both
$R_{\Delta}=R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$. The scatter in the scaling is predominantly
stochastic, showing a weak dependence on formation time and dynamical state. We
recover the DM concentration and mass within $\approx 23$ and $\approx 15$ per
cent of their true values (for $R_{200}$), respectively, and with $\approx 3$
per cent larger uncertainties for $R_{500}$. Alternatively, we find that the
concentration can be estimated using the BCG+ICL fraction, the central's DM
mass using the BCG+ICL flux, and the total DM mass using the bolometric flux.
These results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving dark matter
characteristics of galaxy clusters to be observed with facilities like the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory in the near future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04179v1" target="_blank"><h2>Crosschecking Cosmic Distances from DESI BAO and DES SNe Points to

ratio of $D_M/r_d$ values are consistent with a horizontal, thus confirming
that the distance duality relation holds up to calibration. However, the
$D_H/r_d$ ratio shows a decreasing trend with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ at $2.3
\sigma$ to $2.5 \sigma$ that cannot be explained by physics. We demonstrate
that the result does not depend on the choice of cosmological model, but the
radius of the sound horizon $r_d$ has a much greater influence. Studying ratios
of $D_H/r_d$ is a stronger test than the distance duality relation, and the
rejection of a horizontal confirms systematics in either DESI BAO or DES SNe.

raise doubts about the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a
preference for an inherently dynamical dark energy component. The
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization -- a widely used
two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state -- displays marked
early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These
features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of
such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of
two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original
CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models
reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior
through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual
evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic
microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these
models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive
parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or
disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical
precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed
parameterizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03183v1" target="_blank"><h2>HESS J1831$-$098 -- Exploring a pulsar halo scenario with H.E.S.S. data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Karim Sabri, Yves Gallant, Justine Devin, Kirsty Feijen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in the ICRC 2025 proceedings</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Pulsar halos are a class of extended very-high-energy (VHE) sources
highlighted by the HAWC observatory towards the Geminga pulsar and PSR
B0656$+$14. These VHE sources are interpreted as the inverse Compton emission
from electrons and positrons diffusing in the interstellar medium at an
inhibited rate, having escaped the pulsar wind nebula. Our aim is to search for
new pulsar halos using H.E.S.S. data and to constrain their physical
properties. Using a physically-motivated model of pulsar halos, we created
template-based models of the spatial and energetic distributions of the
expected gamma-ray emission using the Gammapy library. A promising candidate
source to which this model can be effectively applied is HESS J1831$-$098, an
extended VHE source spatially coincident with two energetic pulsars, which also
exhibits spectral continuity and morphological compatibility with the
ultra-high-energy source 1LHAASO J1831$-$1007u*. It could be powered by the
radio pulsar PSR J1831$-$0952 with a characteristic age of 128 kyr. We present
a spectro-morphological analysis of this source with H.E.S.S. data, revealing
that the emission is well described with a pulsar halo model, although we
cannot reject a simple 2D Gaussian morphology. We discuss the implication of
the derived physical parameters of the model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03395v1" target="_blank"><h2>The LMC Corona as Evidence for a First Passage</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Scott Lucchini, Jiwon Jesse Han, Sapna Mishra, Andrew J.

Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> CGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use constrained idealized simulations of the LMC/Milky Way interaction to
determine if the size of the LMC's gaseous halo (Corona) can be used to
distinguish between first and second passage models $-$ an orbital trajectory
for the LMC in which it has just recently approached the Milky Way for the
first time (first passage), or one in which it has had a previous pericenter
(second passage). Using live circumgalactic gas particles combined with
analytic dark matter potentials evolved to follow previously published orbital
trajectories, we find that the first passage model is able to reproduce the
observed velocity profile and column density profile of the present day LMC
Corona. On the other hand, in a second passage scenario the longer interaction
time leads to the velocities and column densities around the LMC at the present
day being too low. Based on this observed velocity profile, recent works have
found that the LMC's Corona has been truncated to 17$-$20 kpc, and we find
truncation radii of $15.3\pm 0.9$ kpc and $7.6\pm 2.0$ kpc for the first and
second passage models, respectively. Thus, based on the gas properties of the
LMC's CGM at the present day, a second passage trajectory is disfavored.</p></br></body>
