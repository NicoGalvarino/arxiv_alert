dusty molecular torus on the parsec scale which is often embedded within a
larger circumnuclear disk (CND). AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of
material through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that
influence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus
Galaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms
responsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this
Seyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We
analysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of
the Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced
dust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied
the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the
Circinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect
directly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures
and argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the
mechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of
0.3-7.5 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material
is expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The
inferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability
in AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales,
the ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow
is stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than
in the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or
collimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its
geometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06134v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving Star Cluster Formation in Galaxy Simulations with Cosmic Ray

galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the
formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay
between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star
formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of
cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We
present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters
with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a
feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the
CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of
CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs
simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass
function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible
with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star
cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity
dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately,
the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae,
and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed
in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more
bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs.
Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback
model, despite this idealized setup.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05667v1" target="_blank"><h2>MEGATRON: the impact of non-equilibrium effects and local radiation

progenitor of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the MEGATRON suite. The simulations
combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium
thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas
in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on
average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation
with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium
(PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that
non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the
thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy
shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for
example, HI damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a
resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the
resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When
refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases
tenfold to $\approx 10^4\,M_\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion
stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of
warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that
non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with
physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict
circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of
targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05220v1" target="_blank"><h2>EIGER VIII: First stars signatures in the connection between OI

systems at z~6, which trace metal-enriched gas during the epoch of
reionization. We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15
overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption
systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering
fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond
typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity
environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is
largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for
$\sim35\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the
remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in
dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\gtrsim
2\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the
galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much
metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show
significantly higher $\log(N_{\rm CII}/N_{\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers
lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O],
[C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with
Population III nucleosynthesis. These rare systems offer a unique window into
the role of first-generation stars in shaping the early metal enrichment of
galaxies and their environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05201v1" target="_blank"><h2>MEGATRON: Reproducing the Diversity of High-Redshift Galaxy Spectra with

These simulations model galaxy formation up to $z\approx8$ in a region that
will collapse into a Milky-Way-like galaxy at $z=0$, while self-consistently
tracking Population III and II (Pop.~III, Pop.~II) star formation, feedback and
chemical enrichment. MEGATRON dwarf galaxies are in excellent agreement with
the observed stellar mass-metallicity relation at $z=0$, including an
over-abundance of dwarfs along a flat plateau in metallicity ($\langle
[\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \approx -2.5$) at low stellar masses ($M_{\star} \leq
10^5 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$). We tie this feature to the chemical enrichment of
dwarf galaxies by Pop.~III pair-instability supernova (PISN) explosions. The
strong Lyman-Werner background (LW) from the protogalaxy ensures that PISNe
occur in haloes massive enough ($\approx 10^7\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$) to retain
their ejecta. We also predict a tail of $\approx 20\%$ of iron-deficient
($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \leq - 3$) dwarf galaxies. We show that both

from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan

variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability
amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the
presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations;
however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The

Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in

lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington
ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the

it drops to a lower value ($\sim 0.9\times10^{-3}$).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05299v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy sizes and compactness at Cosmic Dawn</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  P.

high-mass galaxies ($\log (M^\star / {\rm M} _\odot) \gtrsim 10$) with
extremely small effective radii ($\sim 100\,\rm pc$) at $z \gtrsim 6$. Also,
the existence of an unusual size--mass relation has been claimed. These
observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics
responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to
unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605
snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation
suite FirstLight.
  We find that galaxies undergo an expansion--compaction--re-expansion process.
This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at $\log
(M^\star_ {\rm on} / {\rm M}_\odot) \sim 8.5$ and ends at $\log (M^\star_{\rm
off} / \mathrm{M}_\odot) \sim 9.5$. In between these masses, the size--mass
relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism
driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of
gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the
centre (within $1\, {\rm kpc}$). This contraction continues until conditions
favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth
pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet
compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical
accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of
galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical
expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models.
Contrary to low-redshift galaxies, in high-redshift systems compaction ends
without gas depletion and star-formation quenching.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05223v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on Radial Gas Flows in the Milky Way Disk Revealed by Large
  Stellar Age Catalogs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  James W.

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galactic chemical evolution (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows
carrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these
radial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five
different parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$,
of the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models
predict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer
disk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because
radial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it
elsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the
inner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational
constraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity
($\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations
($\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows
cannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our
models reproduce this result at $R\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is
relatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\approx-1$ km/s. In
agreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower
metallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models.
Exploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative
rates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that
establish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic
formulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this
connection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05515v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Gamma-ray Luminosity Function of Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Garima Rajguru, Lea Marcotulli, Marco Ajello, Mattia Di Mauro, Meg Urry</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ). 18 pages, 12 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We have utilized the largest sample of $\gamma$-ray selected Fermi
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) ever used (519 sources) to construct the
luminosity function and its evolution through the cosmic history. In addition
to spanning large redshift ($0<z\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges
($2.9\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this
sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated
with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood.
We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double
power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a
luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution
with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum
redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at
larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower
luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity
function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity.
This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar
sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs
with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05682v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on dark matter models from the stellar cores observed in

(UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed
by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos.
Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if
such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the
range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core
sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low
sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed
range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature
for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar
mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model
reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent
with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius
with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf
galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the
SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the
mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form
cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If
the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are
thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than
the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially
influence substructure formation in more massive systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05388v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Prevalence of Bursty Star Formation in Low-Mass Galaxies at z=1-7

star-forming galaxies at $1\lesssim z<7$, selected from JWST/NIRSpec G395M and
PRISM spectroscopy provided by the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We analyze the
correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main
sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the
intrinsic scatter in the H$\alpha$-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS.
However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low
stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies.
To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the
dust-corrected H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a
from constant SFH over the past $\sim100$ Myr. In our sample, $73^{+4}_{-4}$%
of galaxies exhibit H$\alpha$-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We
do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H$\alpha$-to-UV
ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies
($7\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})<8.5$) are $30 \pm 1$% more likely to lie above
this equilibrium range -- indicative of a recent ($\lesssim 100$ Myr) burst of
star formation -- compared to higher-mass systems
($8.5\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})\leq10.9$). These results suggest that bursty
SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at $z\sim 1$-$7$ and that this
remains relatively stable across $\sim0.8$-$6$ Gyr after the Big Bang.</p></br></body>
