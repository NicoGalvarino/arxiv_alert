  Predictions for Population III Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Eli Visbal, Ryan Hazlett, Greg L. Bryan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 1 figure, submitted to ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope
observations of the $z=6.6$ Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is
gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the
first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars:
(1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures
ranging from $T_{\rm vir}\sim 10^3-10^4~{\rm K}$, (2) a top-heavy initial mass
function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ${\sim}{\rm a ~few}\times
1000~M_\odot$ in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently
formed Pop III stars hosted in a $\sim 5\times 10^7~M_\odot$ dark matter halo,
some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or
stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to
predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification
provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters
unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy
similar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic
abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because
of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which
would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift
theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that
most Pop III systems form much earlier.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04203v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optimal strategies for measuring gas-phase metallicities in

do not host active galactic nuclei (AGN) are crucial for understanding the role
of AGN in regulating galaxy growth over cosmic time. Recent work at $z=0$ has
demonstrated that a self-consistent comparison of metallicities in AGN-host and
non-AGN galaxies can be conducted within a Bayesian framework given sufficient
coverage of rest-frame optical emission lines. The next generation of adaptive
optics-assisted optical and near-infrared integral field spectrographs promise
to deliver the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution required conduct
comparable measurements at intermediate redshift ($z\sim 1-3$), albeit with a
restricted set of emission lines dictated by the various filter and grating
combinations available. In this work, we explore optimal strategies for
recovering the metallicities of both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies given these
constraints. We consider suites of emission lines that will be practical to
obtain at different redshifts, and test a range of strategies to measure
metallicity using just these lines, evaluating their performance by comparison
to measurements using all the lines to which we have access in $z=0$ optical
spectra. Our results facilitate straightforward estimates of exposure times
required by future instruments to reach specified accuracy goals in a range of
redshift windows using optimal sets of lines, enabling the development of
efficient observing strategies for future surveys. This study can be extended
to spatially resolved galaxies in order to design optimal strategies for
measuring metallicity fluctuation maps in addition to the mean metallicities we
consider here.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03823v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scaling Relations for Dark Matter Halos Hosting Ultra-Faint Dwarf

ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in the case where there are only ${\cal O}(10)$
identified member stars with measured line-of-sight velocities. This scenario
is likely to be increasingly common, as upcoming newly discovered dwarf
galaxies in the Milky Way, by e.g. the Rubin Observatory, will likely (at least
initially) have only a few identified members. Assuming an NFW dark matter
profile, equilibrium modeling likely can only robustly extract one halo
parameter ($\rho_s r_s$), but the scale radius itself will typically be
unconstrained. In these cases, the results obtainable from Jeans modeling can
be well replicated by a simple scaling relation motivated by the half-light
mass estimator. As a application, we examine the recently discovered stellar
system Ursa Major III, which has been optimistically assessed to have the
largest $J$-factor of any known object. We suggest that, because of the
presence of outlier stars, the $J$-factor obtained from modeling of Ursa Major
III is likely inflated, as it is inconsistent with the half-light mass
estimator, while removal of the outliers will leave the $J$-factor
unconstrained from below.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03888v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synthesizer: a Software Package for Synthetic Astronomical Observables</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Christopher C.

  a robust scale for chemical evolution across cosmic time</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Paige M. Kelly, Tucker Jones, Yuguang Chen, Ryan L. Sanders, Danielle A. Berg, Peter Senchyna, Fabio Bresolin, Daniel P. Stark</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star
formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales.
However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and
those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the
abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but
uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase
C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior
optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H
II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate
biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C$^{2+}$ ion which
is consistent with that of O$^{2+}$, assuming a similar temperature structure
in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived
from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also
consistent to within $<0.1$ dex, with an offset of $0.05\pm0.03$ dex in
C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ for the standard T$_e$ method. While the absolute C/H and O/H
abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish
that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably
compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for
studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV
observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04277v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stringent constraint on the CCC+TL cosmology with $H(z)$ Measurements</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lei Lei, Ze-Fan Wang, Tong-Lin Wang, Yi-Ying Wang, Guan-Wen Yuan, Wei-Long Lin, Yi-Zhong Fan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, the Covarying Coupling Constants and Tired Light (CCC+TL) hybrid
model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly small angular diameters of
high-redshift galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that
are challenging to reconcile with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we test
the CCC+TL model against model-independent Hubble parameter [$H(z)$]
measurements obtained from cosmic chronometers. It turns out that the parameter
set optimized for the type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) dataset within the CCC+TL model
fails to reproduce the $H(z)$ data, but the $\Lambda$CDM model works well.
Statistical comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly
favors $\Lambda$CDM over CCC+TL for the $H(z)$ data, with $\Delta \mathrm{BIC}
= 60.85$. Additionally, the fit of the CCC+TL model to the $H(z)$ data results
in a best-fit value for the speed-of-light variation index parameter $\alpha$
disagreeing with that for the SN Ia data at the $\sim 6\sigma$ level,
demonstrating significant internal tension within the CCC+TL framework.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03912v1" target="_blank"><h2>When Stars Mimic Monsters: Luminous Blue Variables in SBS 0335-052 E</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zixuan Peng, Crystal L.

Hennawi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent studies have claimed the detection of an active massive black hole
(BH) in the low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052 E based on
near-infrared (NIR) time variability and broad H$\alpha$ wings. This
interpretation remains questionable given the observed broad wings in forbidden
[O III] emission. Based on spectroscopic properties derived from our KCWI/KCRM
integral-field observation of super star clusters 1 and 2 (SSCs 1$\&$2), we
propose instead that these BH signatures originate from a luminous blue
variable (LBV) outburst in a binary system like $\eta$ Carinae. First, the [Fe
II] emission-line ratio and detected O I 8446 pumped emission require
high-density gas ($n_e \sim 10^6$ $\rm{cm^{-3}}$). This dense gas resides in
the circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by pre-outburst stellar winds. Subsequent
shock interaction between the LBV outburst ejecta and CSM efficiently produces
warm dust and the corresponding NIR excess. Second, SSCs 1$\&$2 are
nitrogen-enriched relative to other SSCs. This enrichment arises from ejections
of CNO-cycled material by multiple LBV outbursts. Third, we detect asymmetric
broad H$\alpha$ wings extending from $\sim -5\,000$ to $\sim 10\,000\
\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This asymmetry results from electron scattering in the
expanding, optically thick CSM. The proposed CSM shock interaction naturally
explains the luminosities of [Fe V] and ultra-luminous X-ray emission.
Contrarily, [Fe II] and [Fe IV] emission originates primarily from gas
photoionized by the cool primary LBV and hot secondary stars, respectively. Our
results highlight how the shock interaction of massive stars with high-density
CSM mimics active massive BH signatures in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03819v1" target="_blank"><h2>Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Marco Cirelli, Arpan Kar, Halim Shaikh</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages, 8 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV
scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM
particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV
$\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a
broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by
the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and
in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions').
We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the
vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a
detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays,
$\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned
signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon
telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission
signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from
cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV
DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at
the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$,
or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions.
Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming
instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in
many cases provide the dominant signal.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03817v1" target="_blank"><h2>Jet collimation in a spiral-hosted AGN: a parabolic jet profile in
  0313-192</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Seung Yeon Lee, Jae-Young Kim</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> molecular gas (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Double-lobed radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs)
are typically found in elliptical galaxies, while supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) in disk galaxies rarely produce powerful kpc-scale jets. However, the
growing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical
dichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such
source, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across
nearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\sim$ pc to $\sim100$ kpc
(projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\sim
610$ pc ($\sim 7.9 \times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition
to a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates
from the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles
those in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how
the jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic
collimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the
sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\sim7.3\times10^{5} R_{S}$),
and no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to
provide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet
confinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal
components, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These
mechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas.
Our results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under
rare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet
formation beyond traditional models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04413v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the residuals in the $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation using the

($M_\bullet-M_*$), diagnosing the residual $\Delta \log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)$
($\Delta$) in this relation to understand the coevolution of the galaxy and
black hole (BH) in the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation SIMBA. We showed
that SIMBA can reproduce the observed $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation well with little
difference between central and satellite galaxies. By using the median value to
determine the residuals, we found that the residual is correlated with galaxy
cold gas content, star formation rate, colour and black hole accretion
properties. Both torque and Bondi models implemented in SIMBA, contribute to
this residual, with torque accretion playing a major role at high redshift and
low-mass galaxies, while Bondi (also BH merge) takes over at low redshift and
massive galaxies. By dividing the sample into two populations: $\Delta>0$ and
$\Delta <0$, we compared their evolution paths following the main progenitors.
With evolution tracking, we proposed a simple picture for the BH-galaxy
coevolution: Early-formed galaxies seeded black holes earlier, with stellar
mass increasing rapidly to quickly reach the point of triggering `jet mode'
feedback. This process reduced the cold gas content and stopped the growth of
$M_*$, effectively quenching galaxies. Meanwhile, during the initial phase of
torque accretion growth, the BH mass is comparable between galaxies formed
early and those formed later. However, those galaxies that formed earlier
appear to attain a marginally greater BH mass when shifting to Bondi accretion,
aligning with the galaxy transition time. As the early-formed galaxies reach
this point earlier -- leaving a longer time for them to have Bondi accretion as
well as merging, their residuals become positive, i.e., having more massive BHs
at $z=0$ compared to these late-formed galaxies at the same $M_*$. This picture
is further supported by the strong positive correlation between the residuals
and the galaxy age, which we are proposing as a verification with observation
data on this story suggested by SIMBA.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04410v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bursting at the seams: the star-forming main sequence and its scatter at

its scatter at redshifts $3 \leq z \leq 9$, using NIRCam photometry from the
JADES survey in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. Our analysis is based on a
sample of galaxies that is stellar mass complete down to $\log
\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \approx 8.1$. The redshift evolution of the
SFMS at an averaging timescale of 10 Myr follows a relation, quantified by the
specific star-formation rates (sSFR$_{10}$), of
$\mathrm{sSFR}\propto(1+z)^{\mu}$ with $\mu = 2.30^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$, in good
agreement with theoretical predictions and the specific mass accretion rate of
dark matter halos. We find that the SFMS normalisation varies in a complex way
with the SFR averaging timescale, reflecting the combined effects of bursty
star formation and rising star formation histories (SFHs). We quantify the
scatter of the SFMS, revealing that it decreases with longer SFR averaging
timescales, from $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.4-0.5~\mathrm{dex}$ at 10 Myr to
$\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.2~\mathrm{dex}$ at 100 Myr, indicating that
shorter-term fluctuations dominate the scatter, although long-term variations
in star formation activity are also present. Our findings suggest that bursty
SFHs are more pronounced at lower stellar masses. Furthermore, we explore the
implications of our results for the observed over-abundance of UV-bright
galaxies at $z > 10$, concluding that additional mechanisms, such as top-heavy
initial mass functions, increased star-formation efficiencies, or increased
burstiness in star formation are needed to explain these observations. Finally,
we emphasize the importance of accurate stellar mass completeness limits when
fitting the SFMS, especially for galaxies with bursty SFHs.</p></br></body>
