activity in galaxies. Sulphur bearing molecules, such as H2S, are sensitive to
the physical and chemical environments in which they reside and are potential
tracers of shocked, dense gas in galactic outflows and active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We aim to investigate the origin of H2S emission and its relation to
dense gas and outflow activity in the central regions of nearby infrared
luminous galaxies. We present ALMA Band 5 observations of the ortho H2S 1(1,0)
1(0,1) transition in three nearby galaxies: NGC 1377, NGC 4418, and NGC 1266.
We perform radiative transfer modelling using RADEX to constrain the physical
conditions of the H2S emitting gas and compare the results to ancillary CO and
continuum data. We detect compact H2S emission in all three galaxies, arising
from regions smaller than approximately 150 parsecs. The H2S spectral profiles
exhibit broad line wings, suggesting an association with outflowing or shocked
gas. In NGC 4418, H2S also appears to be tracing gas that is counterrotating. A
peculiar red shifted emission feature may correspond to inflowing gas, or
possibly a slanted outflow. RADEX modelling indicates that the H2S emitting gas
has high densities (molecular hydrogen density greater than 10^7 cm^-3) and
moderately warm temperatures (between 40 and 200 Kelvin). The derived densities
exceed those inferred from CO observations, implying that H2S traces denser
regions of the interstellar medium.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19901v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of Diffuse Radio Emission in a Massive z=1.709 Cool Core

scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint
surface brightness ($\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual
galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and
relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the
discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most
distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep
LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from
diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming
galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray
emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\rm
150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking
similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the
redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton
losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced
turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require
a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped
distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic
field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further
implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\sim$$10~\mu$G
levels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before
$z\sim2$. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster
physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio
surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution
of galaxy clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20422v1" target="_blank"><h2>Outflows from Star-Forming Galaxies in the Early Universe: Evolution

Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (abstract), outflows (title, abstract), outflow (title, abstract), kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Lyman-$ \alpha $ emission, which owing to its resonant nature strongly
couples the emergent line profile to gas kinematics, has become a key
observable for probing outflows from star-forming galaxies in the early
universe. Typically, Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are explained in terms of
idealised expanding shell models, while empirically-motivated interpretations
of Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles that make use of comparisons with kinematics
revealed by other spectral features (e.g. metal emission and absorption lines)
are limited. Here, we analyse the kinematics of emission/absorption lines in
the spectra of 338 gravitationally-lensed Lyman-$ \alpha $ sources revealed via
blind spectroscopy of galaxy clusters with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE). Using metal emission lines to measure systemic redshifts, we
confirm that the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are consistent with outflowing gas.
In cases where interstellar metal absorption lines are detected, we find their
kinematics and line ratios to be indicative of clumpy outflows. We investigate
the differences between sources with single- and double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $
profiles, finding the latter to drive weaker outflows yet show spectral
signatures suggestive of younger stellar ages ($ < 4\,$Myr compared with $ >
20\,$Myr for sources with single-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles). We argue
that double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles may reflect weaker feedback in
extremely young starbursts due to the delayed onset of supernova explosions. We
also investigate whether outflow properties can be reliably inferred by fitting
simple expanding shell models. We find that these models yield unphysical
parameters in many cases even when they can reproduce the Lyman-$ \alpha $
profiles to high precision, and urge caution when inferring outflow properties
from such models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21026v1" target="_blank"><h2>Balmer Decrement and IRX Break in Tracing Dust Attenuation at Scales of

indicators of dust attenuation for 609 ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions at
scales of $\sim 50-200$ pc in NGC 628, utilizing data from AstroSat, James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Our
findings indicate that about three fifths of the sample ${\rm {H\,{\small
II}}}$ regions reside within the regime occupied by local star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) along the dust attenuation correlation described by their corresponding
color excess parameters $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX} = 0.51\,E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm
H}\beta}$. Nearly 27$\%$ of the sample exhibits $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}> E(B-V)_{{\rm
H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$, while a small fraction ($\sim 13\%$) displays
significantly lower $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}$ compared to $E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm
H}\beta}$. These results suggest that the correlation between the two dust
attenuation indicators no longer holds for spatially resolved ${\rm {H\,{\small
II}}}$ regions. Furthermore, the ratio of $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}$ to $E(B-V)_{{\rm
H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$ remains unaffected by various physical parameters of
the ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions, including star formation rate (SFR), SFR
surface density, infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$), $L_{\rm IR}$ surface
density, stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, circularized radius, and the
distance to galactic center. We argue that the ratio is primarily influenced by
the evolution of surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) of the star-forming
regions, transitioning from an early dense and thick phase to the late
blown-away stage.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21477v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quasar cosmology II: joint analyses with Cosmic Microwave Background</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between
theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after
25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has
elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings
of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence,
it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at
distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed
dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their
consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs
with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard
cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting
dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations
affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas
model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm,
using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS)
for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from
$\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models
of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of
probes at all scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21531v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Kaleidoscope Survey: Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters

J0949.8+1708. Each cluster contains at least one radial arc, a unique physical
feature that allows for more precise measurements of the inner mass profile (R
< 50 kpc) from strong lensing. We present the first strong lensing analysis for
MACS J0326 and MACS J1427. We use a combination of HST imaging and VLT/MUSE
observations from the ESO Kaleidoscope Clusters Survey, a large `filler'
program, to identify and measure redshifts for multiply-imaged systems and
obtain the 2-D stellar velocity dispersion for each centrally-located brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG). The BCG kinematics are used to subtract the baryonic mass
component from the inner mass profile. We find total mass density profiles
consistent with previous works using a combination of strong lensing and BCG
kinematics. The overall shape of these profiles appears core-like, with an
average dark matter slope measurement of $\gamma$~0.66. These results
demonstrate the ongoing need for the construction of observational models for
galaxy clusters, and show how galaxy-scale kinematics can be used to
disentangle baryonic and dark matter concentrations in cluster cores.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20896v1" target="_blank"><h2>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- III: Feeding and

emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well
as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is
well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by
~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the
H$_2$2.12$\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\mu$m and
Pa$\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk
seen as a narrow component ($\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad
outflow ($\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad
component ($\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$
values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical
images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust
lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 8
x 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For
the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04

reionization (EoR) gives us a hint to understand what types of galaxies
contribute to reionization. Although recent studies have pointed out the
positive correlation between high ionizing photon escape fractions and high [O
III] $88~\mu\mathrm{m}$-to-[C II] $158~\mu\mathrm{m}$ ratios found in
UV-luminous star-forming galaxies at $z > 6$ with ALMA, previous studies have
paid little attention to the neutral gas porosity that allows ionizing photons
to escape. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a $z=8.312$ Lyman break
galaxy, MACS0416_Y1 with a high $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88}/L_\mathrm{[CII]158}$ ratio
($\approx9$) and dust continuum detection. We construct a multi-phase ISM model
incorporating the neutral gas covering fraction ($cov_\mathrm{PDR}$). The
best-fit model reveals a $cov_\mathrm{PDR}\approx25 \%$, indicating that
$\approx75 \%$ of the ionized gas region is exposed to intercloud space. We
confirm that our conclusions hold even when varying star-formation history,
stellar age, gas/stellar metallicity, and carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio.
This finding meets one of the necessary conditions for galaxies to have a
non-zero escape fraction of ionizing photons and supports recent studies that
galaxies with a high [O III] $88~\mu\mathrm{m}/$[C II] $158~\mu\mathrm{m}$
ratio, such as MACS0416_Y1, could contribute to cosmic reionization.
Furthermore, the modeled H II region with the best-fitting parameters has a
typical size ($D=0.90~\mathrm{pc}$) and gas density ($\log
n_\mathrm{H,c}/\mathrm{cm^{-3}}=2.7$) that are comparable to local compact H II
regions. This suggests that the H II regions in MACS0416_Y1 are in an early
evolutionary stage.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21320v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Obscured Star Formation in Galaxy Clusters Using JWST Medium

the advanced stages of galaxy evolution within dense environments. We present a
sample of 3.3$\mu$m PAH-bright galaxies in the Abell 2744 (A2744) galaxy
cluster. Using F430M medium band images, we select PAH emitters in the galaxy
cluster, which capture the 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission at the redshift of A2744. Our
multi-wavelength study demonstrates consistent star formation rates (SFRs)
derived from PAH emission and SED fitting, indicating the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH flux
estimated from medium band image alone can reveal the entirety of star
formation, immune to dust obscuration. We find that the PAH emitters are
located in relatively low mass surface density regions of A2744, with SFRs
aligning with the field star-forming main sequence at $z=0.3$. The PAH emission
morphologies show more asymmetry than that of the F444W image when asymmetry
index $> 0.4$. With these results, we suggest that these star-forming galaxies
in A2744 are in the stage of falling into the cluster from the field, and have
not been quenched yet. We further explore a potential link between these
galaxies and cosmic filaments being accreted onto the cluster, which may
channel gas inflows to fuel star formation. JWST medium-band imaging provides a
powerful new tool for identifying heavily dust-obscured star-forming
populations. Future HI and low-J CO observations should be prioritized to
resolve the cold gas kinematics and star formation processes in these systems,
which would directly test the role of environmental stripping versus
filamentary gas supply.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19902v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational Torques from a Lopsided Young Stellar Component Sustain

observed as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While mergers can drive luminous AGN
episodes, secular processes may fuel a substantial portion of cosmic BH growth.
Whether these mechanisms can sustain high BH accretion rates remains uncertain.
This study aims to identify the secular mechanism driving high BH accretion
rates, by targeting a galaxy with moderately massive SMBH, high central gas
densities, accretion rates of a few percent of the Eddington limit, and gas
kinematics resolved close to black hole-dominated scales. A blind search led to
the identification of NGC 4593, which is representative of the AGN population
driving BH mass density growth since $z=1$. A prominent single-arm ("$m=1$")
molecular gas spiral with ${\rm log}\,M_{\rm mol}/{\rm M}_\odot=8.1\pm0.3$
extends from 1.3$\,$kpc down to the SMBH's sphere of influence
($1.7^{+0.5}_{-0.2}\,{\rm pc}$). Star formation in the spiral is inefficient
(${\rm SFR} = 4.9 \times 10^{-2} \,{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}$, $\langle t_{\rm
dep}\rangle=3.9 \pm 0.6\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas inflow rate exceeds the SFR by two
orders of magnitude and is sufficient to sustain the current BH accretion rate
for $\geq$35$\,$Myr, enabling $\sim$10% SMBH growth. A young, lopsided stellar
component (${\rm log}\,M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot=7.5-9.3$) exerts torques on the
molecular gas, likely driving the gas inflow. This young stellar component may
serve as both a cause and a product of sustained gas funnelling towards the
SMBH. These findings provide evidence for the sustained secular $m=1$ feeding
mode at high BH accretion rates, linking kpc-scale gas dynamics to the black
hole's sphere of influence. This mechanism, consistent with simulation
predictions, may represent a key contributor to SMBH growth in luminous AGNs
since cosmic noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21283v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hiding behind a curtain of dust: Gas and dust properties of an

sub-arcsecond resolution ($\sim0.75$) ALMA observations, VLT/MUSE and FORS2
optical data, as well as spectral scans from the ACA and the LMT) we identify
two high-significance (SNR>5) emission lines at 97.0 and 145.5 GHz,
corresponding to CO(4-3) and CO(6-5), respectively. These detections yield a

detection of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line at 400 GHz using the
Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), further confirming the redshift and
providing insights into J154506's physical properties. By modeling ALMA Band 6
and 7 continuum data in the uv-plane, we derive an average magnification factor
of $6.0 \pm 0.4$ and our analysis reveals a relatively cold dust ($\sim$37 K)
in a starburst galaxy with a high intrinsic dust mass
($\sim2.5\times10^{9}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) and infrared (IR) luminosity
($\sim6\times10^{12}~\rm{L}_{\odot}$). The dust SED is best reproduced by a
model dominated by moderately dense molecular gas ($10^2-10^4\rm{cm}^{-3}$),
indicating that the far-infrared emission arises primarily from diffuse regions
rather than compact, high-pressure environments typical of extreme starbursts
or AGN. This is supported by the close-to-unity ratio between the dust and
kinetic temperatures, which argues against highly energetic heating mechanisms.
The CO excitation ladder peaks close to CO(5-4) and is dominated by slightly
denser molecular gas. Our results underscore the unique power of far-IR and
submillimeter observations to both uncover and characterize scarce, strongly
lensed, high-redshift galaxies, even when obscured by foreground molecular

galaxies. Therefore the less numerous nearby galaxies presenting kpc-sized
clumps represent unique laboratories from which to address the mechanisms
driving clump formation and study why such structures become less common in the
local Universe, and why they tend to exhibit smaller sizes and lower star
formation rates compared to their high-$z$ counterparts. We use high spatial
resolution Integral Field Unit observations from VLT/MUSE to investigate the
properties of several kpc-sized clumps seen in SDSS J020536-081424, a $z
\approx 0.04$ dwarf irregular galaxy interacting with its more massive
companion Mrk 1172 ($\log (M/M_{\odot}) \sim 11$). H$\alpha$ channel maps
reveal that the clumps are embedded within a rotating ionised gas component,
possibly a disk. Self-consistent full-spectral fitting of the clump spectra
with $\mathrm{FADO}$ indicates that their young ($t \leq 10$ Myr) populations
have lower stellar metallicities compared to the older ($t \gtrsim 100$ Myr)
ones, although these estimates are subject to significant degeneracies. The
clumpy SF in SDSS J020536-081424 seems to occur in the disk, which dominates
the stellar emission. Gas-phase metallicities derived through strong-line
calibrations exhibit a flat distribution around $Z_{\mathrm{gas}} \approx

processes. There is no evidence for a strong anti-correlation between
$Z_{\mathrm{gas}}$ and $\mathrm{SFR}$, although clump sizes are likely
overestimated due to seeing limitations. The lower $Z_{\ast}$ of younger
stellar populations compared to the disk suggests clump formation driven by

We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and
environment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation
history, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the
possible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods.
We analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular
gas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784.
The potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed
using photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a
regular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular
gas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be
explained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to
CO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion
following a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas
collapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc,
shows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in
GAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion
may have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a
high-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have
undergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity.
The presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed
encounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in
progress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent
evolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers
beyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of
GAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20951v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA Observations of Molecular Complexity in the Large Magellanic Cloud:

hot ($>$100 K) regions around massive protostars and are one of the main
production sites of complex organic molecules (COMs, $\geq6$ atoms, including
carbon). The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal place to study hot core
and COM formation in an environment that is different from our Galaxy, though
prior to this study there have only been nine detections of extragalactic hot
cores (seven in the LMC and two in the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). Here, we
report 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the star-forming region N160 that we
named N160A-mm. We identify six 1.2 mm continuum sources, four of which are
associated with methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission. Another COM, methyl cyanide
(CH$_3$CN) is associated with the brightest source, N160A-mmA, the most
chemically rich source in the field. Using the XCLASS software, we perform
spectral modeling to estimate rotational temperatures and total column
densities of detected molecular species for four sources. Based on the
temperature exceeding 100 K, small size, and high H$_2$ number density, we
identify N160A-mmA as a hot core. We compare the molecular abundances of this
newly detected hot core with those previously detected in the LMC and SMC, as
well as with a sample of Galactic hot cores, and discuss the complex nature of
N160A-mmA.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20448v1" target="_blank"><h2>The changing impact of radio jets as they evolve: The view from the cold

galaxy, PKS 0023-26, hosted by a far-infrared bright galaxy. The galaxy has a
luminous optical AGN and a very extended distribution of molecular gas. We used
these observations (together with available CO(2-1) data) to trace the impact
of the AGN across the extent of the radio emission and beyond on scales of a
few kpc. Despite the strength of the optical AGN, the kinematics of the cold
molecular gas is strongly affected only in the central kpc, and is more weakly
affected around the northern lobe. We found other signatures of the substantial
impact of the radio AGN, however. Most notably, extreme line ratios of the CO
transitions in a region aligned with the radio axis indicate conditions very
different from those observed in the undisturbed gas at large radii. The
non-detection of CO(1-0) at the location of the core of the radio source
implies extreme conditions at this location. Furthermore, on the scale of a few
kpc, the cold molecular gas appears to be wrapped around the northern radio
lobe. This suggests that a strong jet-cloud interaction has depleted the
northern lobe of molecular gas, perhaps as a result of the hot wind behind the
jet-induced shock that shreds the clouds via hydrodynamic instabilities. The
higher gas velocity dispersion and molecular excitation that we observed close
to this location may then be the result of a milder interaction in which the
expanding jet cocoon induces turbulence in the surrounding interstellar medium.
These results highlight that the impact of an AGN can manifest itself not only
in the kinematics of the gas, but also in molecular line ratios and in the
distribution of the gas. Although the radio plasma and the cold molecular gas
are clearly coupled, the kinetic energy that is transferred to the ISM is only
a small fraction of the energy available from the AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20002v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Morphology Classification: Are Stellar Circularities Enough?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Katarina Baucalo, Ana Mitrašinović</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Serbian Astronomical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a preliminary study exploring whether the stellar orbital
circularity of simulated galaxies, available from precomputed catalogs in the
IllustrisTNG project, can be used as a proxy for broad morphological
classification. We focus on the publicly available "Stellar Circularities,
Angular Momenta, Axis Ratios" catalog, which enables a simple kinematic
decomposition of the stellar component into disk and spheroid subsystems. By
validating this approach against the more detailed five-component kinematic
decomposition in TNG50, we confirm that the circularity-based disk fraction
correlates most strongly with the thin disk, while the bulge fraction broadly
represents the combined contribution of classical bulges and stellar halos. We
then apply this decomposition to galaxies in the TNG100 simulation at redshift
$z=0$ and identify a data-motivated threshold of $\mathrm{F_{disk}} = 0.25$ to
distinguish early- and late-type galaxies. This threshold, lower than the
commonly adopted value of $0.4$, better captures the diversity of
disk-dominated systems and avoids excluding galaxies with moderately prominent
disks. Additionally, we identify irregular or morphologically complex systems
based on galaxies with low total disk and spheroid mass fractions. Using this
classification, we recover a morphology-density relation that is broadly
consistent with observations: late-type galaxies dominate in the field, while
early-type galaxies are the most prevalent morphological type in clusters. Our
results demonstrate that stellar circularity alone can serve as an accessible
and computationally efficient morphological proxy. We also discuss the
potential for this classification to support machine learning efforts as a
baseline or training set for future morphological studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20767v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Importance of the Population III Initial Mass Function in
  Determining the Characteristics of the Earliest Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Richard Sarmento, Evan Scannapieco</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use large-scale cosmological simulations to study the prospect of
observing Population III (Pop III) bright galaxies with the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). To quantify the impact of radiative transfer (RT), we compare
a simulation that includes moment-based RT with one in which RT is handled
approximately. Both simulations include a subgrid model of turbulent mixing,
which is essential in tracking the formation of Pop III stars. We find that RT
has a minor impact on our results and that the overall star formation rate
densities for both simulations are in fair agreement with observations and
other simulations. While our overall galaxy luminosity functions are consistent
with current high-redshift observations, we predict a drop of a factor of at
least 6 in detectable galaxy counts at $z = 14$ as compared to $z = 12$ at
$M_{ab}$ $\le$ -16. Modeling Pop III stars according to a lognormal, top-heavy
initial mass function (IMF), we find that these stars contribute no more than
about 1 percent of the flux of potentially detectable lensed galaxies at $z =
12$-14 with $M_{ab} \le -15$. This is because a top-heavy Pop III IMF results
in 99 percent of Pop III stellar mass being recycled within 10 Myr, well before
the approx. 30 Myr timescale on which galaxies recover from supernova feedback
and heating. These effects conspire to quickly extinguish Pop III star
formation, making their detection difficult even for JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20211v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hybrid Morphology Radio Sources from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey

galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of
the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on
the other. These unique sources provide valuable insights into the physical
mechanisms behind the FR dichotomy. In this study, we report the discovery of
thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the
southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line
survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities, with
a median value of 4.4 $\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located
within the redshift range 0.04 < z < 1.34. To gain further insights into their
origin, we also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of
their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated
near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that
extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are
high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), hosted by actively star-forming
galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that hybrid morphology may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a
dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one
jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection
of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still
necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19900v1" target="_blank"><h2>Perturbing AGN Accretion Disks with Stars and Moderately Massive Black

in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this model, an orbiting companion interacts
with the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH).
This interaction excites spiral density waves, leading to bursts of mass inflow
lasting a few orbital timescales, whose mass content depends sensitively on the
sphere of influence of the orbiting companion. To explain changing-look (CL)
AGN, we find that lighter SMBH companions are necessary, while we generally
exclude stellar companions. The moderately massive black hole perturber must be
on a highly eccentric orbit in order to account for the non-repeating nature of
most CL AGN. When applied to quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), we find that
stars with highly eccentric orbits and close pericenter passages can produce
accretion flares with QPE-like characteristics. For many QPEs, low-mass
main-sequence stars or stripped-envelope stars are required. Although
moderately massive black hole perturbers could also match the observed
properties of QPEs, the gravitational-wave merger timescales of such binary
systems are prohibitively short.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20479v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MALATANG survey: Dense gas distribution on sub-kiloparsec scales

James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey, combined with
archival HCN J=1-0 and HCO^+ J=1-0 data from the Green Bank Telescope, to study
the spatial distribution and excitation conditions of dense molecular gas in
the disk of M82. We detect HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 emission within the
central region (< 500 pc) of the galaxy, while the J=1-0 emission lines exhibit
a more extended spatial distribution (> 700 pc). The dense gas shows a clear
double-lobed structure in both spatial distribution and kinematics, with the
HCN and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines in the southwest lobe blueshifted by ~ 40 km/s
relative to the J=1-0 lines. The HCN J=4-3/1-0 and HCO^+ J=4-3/1-0
line-luminosity ratios range from 0.09 to 0.53 and from 0.14 to 0.87,
respectively, with mean values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.36 +/- 0.06. The HCN
ratio is lower than the typical average observed in nearby star-forming
galaxies, whereas the HCO^+ ratio is comparatively higher, suggesting that the
high-J HCN emission in M82 is significantly sub-thermally excited. Spatially,
the peak values of the J=4-3/1-0 ratios are found in the northwest region of
M82, coinciding with the galaxy-scale outflow. Elevated HCN/HCO^+ ratios are
also detected in roughly the same area, potentially tracing local excitation
enhancements driven by the outflow. The HCN/HCO^+ J=4-3 ratio across all
detected regions ranges from 0.19 to 1.07 with a mean value of 0.41 +/- 0.11,
which is significantly lower than the average J=1-0 ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.08.
Both ratios are significantly lower than the average values observed in nearby
star-forming galaxies, which could be related to the relatively low gas density
and the presence of an extended photo-dissociation region in M82.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20824v1" target="_blank"><h2>Planck Constraints on Axion-Like Particles through Isotropic Cosmic

axion-like particles (ALPs), derived from the analysis of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) polarization measurements obtained with the high-frequency
channels of Planck. Recent measurements report a hint of isotropic cosmic
birefringence, though its origin remains uncertain. The detailed dynamics of
ALPs can leave characteristic imprints on the shape of the $EB$ angular power
spectrum, which can be exploited to constrain specific models of cosmic
birefringence. We first construct a multi-frequency likelihood that
incorporates an intrinsic nonzero $EB$ power spectrum. We also show that the
likelihood used in previous studies can be further simplified without loss of
generality. Using this framework, we simultaneously constrain the ALP model
parameters, the instrumental miscalibration angle, and the amplitudes of the
$EB$ power spectrum of a Galactic dust foreground model. We find that, if ALPs
are responsible for the observed cosmic birefringence, ALP masses at
$\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\simeq-27.8$, $-27.5$, $-27.3$, $-27.2$, $-27.1$,
as well as $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\in[-27.0,-26.5]$, are excluded at more

formation not only inside the galaxy but also in an HI cloud in the eastern HI

several ultra-blue compact objects ($\rm F555W - F814W <-0.5 mag,\, FWHM\sim

star formation in diffuse HI tails could highlight an potential aspect of
galaxy stellar halo formation, warranting further investigation of the impact
of star formation in halos on galaxy evolution.</p></br></body>
