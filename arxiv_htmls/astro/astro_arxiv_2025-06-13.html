by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies,
triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy
merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and
spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin
collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism
spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN.
A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In
addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous
extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst
is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the
AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical
simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of
this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation,
driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated
yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar
mass assembly in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10799v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas-Poor Hosts and Gas-Rich Companions of $z\approx$3.5 Radio AGN: ALMA

providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and
star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum
observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$,
focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within
projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of
these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the
AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at
0.2" resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by
re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our
sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}<L_{\rm
[CII]}/L_{\odot}<4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim
9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our
findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We
propose that these companions, which may be stripped clouds in merger process
and by interaction with the energy output from the AGN, could also be a trigger
of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g.,
shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In
general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are
impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circum-galactic or
proto-intracluster media.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09962v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Theoretical Three-Dimensional Diagram to Separate Star Formation,
  Active Galactic Nuclei, and Shocks in Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Peixin Zhu, Lisa J. Kewley, Ralph S. Sutherland, Kathryn Grasha</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 7 figures (2 interactive figures available in the online journal), accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The excitation sources in galaxies are frequently mixed due to AGN and
stellar feedback, including star formation, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
shock excitation. Disentangling the star formation, AGN, and shocks in galaxy
integral-field spectra (IFU) at optical wavelengths is crucial to expanding the
galaxy sample for AGN and stellar feedback studies, given the lack of
multiwavelength observations for most of the galaxies that are observed in
optical wavelengths. Previous methods to address this issue either have a
limited application range or are highly uncertain in separating AGN from shock
excitation (D'Agostino et al. 2019; Johnston et al. 2023). Here, we propose a
theoretical three-dimensional (3D) diagram. This theoretical 3D diagram
overcomes the limitations of previous methods and can simultaneously separate
star formation, AGNs, and shocks in active galaxies. Along with the separation,
the new theoretical 3D diagram also constrains the gas metallicity, ionization
parameter, and gas pressure within the galaxy. By applying the Very Large
Telescope (VLT)/MUSE IFU data and the Wide Field Spectrograph IFU data for
NGC5728 on the theoretical 3D diagram, we find a star-forming ring surrounding
the galaxy center with a projected radius of $\sim$1 kpc in the sky plane, an
AGN ionized-bicone extended up to $\sim$2 kpc from the nuclear center, and a
fast shock dominated disk region at the base of the AGN outflow, which is
likely associated with a nuclear accretion disk or a result of jet-ISM
interaction. The theoretical 3D diagram opens a new window to study the
interplay among star formation, AGN, and shocks in active galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10063v1" target="_blank"><h2>Time-scales of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and dust continuum

Thilker</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent JWST mid-infrared (mid-IR) images, tracing polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dust continuum emission, provide detailed views of the
interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1
and PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes
of gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative
spatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\mu$m) and H$\alpha$ emission at
various scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in
galaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation
is detected in H$\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the
stellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\alpha$ emission. This
significant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions,
illuminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR
time-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO.
Although mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution,
radiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two
time-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission,
they quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is
likely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with
near-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is
longer in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured
backgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM
surrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This
suggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10220v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematic Confirmation of a Remarkable Linear Trail of Galaxies in the
  NGC 1052 Field, Consistent with Formation in a High-Speed Bullet Dwarf
  Collision</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Michael A. Keim, Pieter van Dokkum, Zili Shen, Harrison Souchereau, Imad Pasha, Shany Danieli, Roberto Abraham, Aaron J. Romanowsky, Yimeng Tang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC
1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and
DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It
has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two
gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are
kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a
function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and
DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven
additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses
presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain
measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a
novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on
Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity
trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly
occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly
higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate,
kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail
of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A
'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual
properties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10122v1" target="_blank"><h2>A novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around
  supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mayank Sharma, Gonzalo Herrera, Nahum Arav, Shunsaku Horiuchi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the
vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping
measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of
multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different
radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark
matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen
AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii,
hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2
$\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark
matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$,
consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by
stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to
derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters.
Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from
the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or
constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of
extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and
nature of dark matter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10083v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multidepth datasets with
  selection effects: a case study for $3<z<5$ Ly$α$ emitters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Davide Tornotti, Matteo Fossati, Michele Fumagalli, Davide Gerosa, Lorenzo Pizzuti, Fabrizio Arrigoni Battaia</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity
function of any class of objects by jointly modeling data from multiple surveys
with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly
accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g., in
luminosity) and could be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass.
We validate the model using mock catalogs, recovering how deep data reaching
$\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity $\tilde{L}^\star$ are
essential to reduce biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex), while
wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As proof of concept, we consider
a combined sample of 1176 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 < z < 5$ drawn
from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow
($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide
($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the
luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) =
-2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) =
42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the
uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in
agreement with studies based on gravitational lensing that reach
$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the
faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In
contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain
the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$],
where statistical uncertainties still dominate.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10518v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the local supervoid solution to the Hubble tension with direct
  distance tracers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Richard Stiskalek, Harry Desmond, Sergij Mazurenko, Indranil Banik</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 7 figures. To be submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around
the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in
redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in
near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local
Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the
Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local
expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the
Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to
direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4
compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void
density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of
less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by
Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local
Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or
$70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is
exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two
ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance
ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The
exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over
$1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models
produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from
CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such
estimates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09395v1" target="_blank"><h2>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM. I. Kinematic and

3783. For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed
characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic
nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along
with their ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_{\rm H}$. The
high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption
lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower
energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our
spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum
uncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow
absorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In
addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe
XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic
luminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve
spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically
broader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent
velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases
with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally
declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point,
suggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption
profile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV
absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer
that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a
'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving
mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind
models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10928v1" target="_blank"><h2>Two coincidences are a clue: Probing a GeV-scale dark QCD sector</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yi Chung</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The similarity between dark matter and baryon energy densities suggests the

small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions

GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we
investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can
resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with
the latest measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model
prediction, is also discussed. Current constraints leave a finite window in the

explored. In this paper, we discuss future observations that will facilitate
the discovery of the gas flow pathways in galaxies and the telescope parameters

resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities on the Habitable Worlds
Observatory (HWO) that will enable observations in a wavelength range of 940 -
3500 A (minimum range: 970 - 3000 A) and at a resolution of 100,000 (minimum of
50,000). We advocate 19 for a multi-object spectrograph with thousands of
sub-arcsec slitlets and a field of view 6' x 6'. We also recommend that the
spectrograph be sensitive enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or
higher within a few hours for a continuum source of 21 AB magnitude and
estimate an optimal aperture size of 8 meters. These capabilities would enable
the characterization of gas in the disk-halo interface, leading to

$\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the
$\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in
$\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong

densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong
correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2
fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two
sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we
find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of
$\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk
masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid
of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these
mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination
of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses
are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint
disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk
masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between
$10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10740v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VI.

dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA
Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three
star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the
observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust
evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of
models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with
different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and
dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth,
weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any
observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The
observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible
with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$,
suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of
the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and
sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are
consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The
evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an
unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular
resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from
comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive

and 8.4GHz of three nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, identified via
mid-infrared spectroscopic analyses as hosting deeply embedded active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal
compact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744,
accounting for $\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The
non-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4
GHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no
conclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of
$10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the
mid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object
exhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further
investigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three
galaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse
kpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One
possible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced
particle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum,
characteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening
attributable to this AGN activity. Consequently, the spectral steepening at

Gil de Paz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the
chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be
determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we
investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously
unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric
distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We
obtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field
unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting
red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial
velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six
elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated
estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +-
0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7
kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +-
0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and
indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance
ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both
clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +-
0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for
Galactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high
resolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of
the outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10277v1" target="_blank"><h2>Precipitation plausible: magnetized thermal instability in the
  intracluster medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Benjamin D. Wibking, G. Mark Voit, Brian W. O'Shea</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of galaxy-cluster cores reveal that AGN feedback is strongly
associated with both a short central cooling time ($t_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^9 \,
{\rm yr}$) and accumulations of cold gas ($\lesssim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$). Also,
the central ratio of cooling time to freefall time is rarely observed to drop
below $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$, and large accumulations of cold gas
are rarely observed in environments with $t_{\rm c} / t_{\rm ff} \gtrsim 30$.
Here we show that the critical range -- $10 \lesssim t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}
\lesssim 30$ -- plausibly results from magnetized thermal instability. We
present numerical simulations of magnetized stratified atmospheres with an
initially uniform magnetic field. Thermal instability in an otherwise static
atmosphere with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$ progresses to nonlinear
amplitudes, causing cooler gas to accumulate, as long as the background ratio
of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is $\beta \lesssim 100$. And in
atmospheres with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 20$, cooler gas accumulates for
$\beta \lesssim 10$. Magnetized atmospheres are therefore much more likely to
precipitate than unmagnetized atmospheres with otherwise identical properties.
We hypothesize that AGN feedback triggered by accumulations of cold gas
prevents $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ from dropping much below 10, because cold gas
inevitably precipitates out of magnetized galactic atmospheres with lower
ratios, causing $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ to rise.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10542v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) V: properties of volume-limited

often appear to be underestimated. Existing literature on AGB stars
under-samples both the most and least extreme nearby dust-producing stars. We
reproduce the literature star-formation history of the solar neighbourhood,
though stellar-evolution models over-predict the number of AGB stars of ages
around 500 Myr. The distribution of AGB stars broadly matches the known 300 pc
scale height of the Galactic disc and shows concentration in the direction of
the Galactic centre. Most dust-producing carbon stars belong to the Galactic
thick-disc population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10738v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): V.

crucial for our understanding of planet formation, yet it has proven hard to
constrain observationally, due both to the difficulties of measuring gas masses
and the lack of a homogeneous sample. Here we present a large grid of
thermochemical models which we use to measure protoplanetary gas disk masses of
AGE-PRO, the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. AGE-PRO
covers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with
ages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations
of CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes
out. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time,
from 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (<1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4
Msun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6
Myr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass
distributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to
survivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO
emitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does
not significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco. From Lupus to Upper Sco
the median gas-to-dust mass ratio increases by a factor ~3 from ~40 to ~120,
suggesting efficient inward pebble drift and/or the formation of planetesimals.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09688v1" target="_blank"><h2>CSST Cosmological Emulator II: Generalized Accurate Halo Mass Function

Comments are welcome!</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Accurate theoretical prediction for halo mass function across a broad
cosmological space is crucial for the forthcoming China Space Station Telescope
(CSST) observations, which will capture cosmological information from multiple
probes, e.g., cluster abundance, and weak lensing. In this work, we quantify
the percent-level impact of different mass binning schemes when measuring the
differential halo mass function from simulations, and demonstrate that the
cumulative form of the halo mass function is independent of the binning scheme.
Through the recently finished Kun simulation suite, we propose a generalized
framework to construct multiple accurate halo mass function emulators for
different halo mass definitions, including $M_{200m}$, $M_{vir}$, and
$M_{200c}$. This extends our CSST Emulator to provide fast and accurate halo
mass function predictions for halo mass $M\geq 10^{12}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ up to
$z=3.0$. For redshifts $z\leq 1.0$, the accuracy is within $2\%$ for $M\leq
10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, $5\%$ for $M\leq 10^{14}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, and
$10\%$ for $M\leq 10^{15}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, which is comparable with the
statistical errors of training simulations. This tool is integrated in CSST
Emulator and publicly available at https://github.com/czymh/csstemu.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10752v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XII.
  Extreme millimetre variability detected in a Class II disc</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  James M. Miley, Laura M.

TorresVillanueva</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ for the special issue of AGE-PRO</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II
protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually
interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to
the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of
the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of
the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions.
We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre
wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the
nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum
observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent
emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the
image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1)
emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less
than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness
coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity
of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the
product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature
of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary
systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet
undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object,
the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar
surface or a strong accretion burst.</p></br></body>
