In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14668v1" target="_blank"><h2>From the Solar System to cosmological distances: a complete formalism for gravitational wave astrometry</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gabriele Perna, Nicola Bellomo, Vincenzo Roatti, Daniele Bertacca<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 41 pages + 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The presence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) can be established not only via exquisitely precise pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements, but also via astrometric observations. Indeed, the very same background responsible for the delay in the arrival time of pulse causes an apparent displacement of galactic objects as stars and asteroids. In this work we provide a framework that allows to derive the displacement of sources overcoming the usually adopted ``infinite distance'' approximation. We also present how this formalism can be used to study the displacements of objects at distances comparable to the GW wavelength, as asteroids, and of objects with a non-trivial three-dimensional distribution, as stars in the Milky Way. Thus, it can be used to probe frequencies beyond PTA experiments, reaching the mHz GWs, also detectable by LISA. We forecast the capability of observing the astrometric deflection induced by a GWB evaluating the harmonic signal-to-noise ratio including correlations between different probes. We find an SNR greater than one for the relevant cases considered and as a consequence a promising Fisher forecast, suggesting a constraining power up to the percent level for a flat background.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14664v1" target="_blank"><h2>NGC 3521 as the Milky Way near twin: spectral energy distribution from UV to radio decameter ranges</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> O.

We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}<11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14646v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio emission in star-forming galaxies: connection to restarted or relic AGN activity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marco Albán, Dominika Wylezalek, Pranav Kukreti, Rogemar A.

In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies with no clear current AGN signatures. Using low-(LOFAR, 144MHz) and high-frequency (FIRST, 1.4GHz) surveys, combined with spatially resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, we compare SF galaxies with 144 MHz detections that either do or do not have GHz detections. Despite being matched in stellar mass, redshift, and radio (MHz) luminosity, GHz-detected SF galaxies systematically differ from their non-GHz-detected counterparts. The former display enhanced ionized gas-emission line widths, higher central outflow fractions, redder colors, increased central obscuration, and offset emission-line ratios that shift towards (or closer to) the AGN regime (in the [NII] BPT diagram). Furthermore, the non-GHz galaxies are likely undetected due to their extended radio morphologies, while the GHz-detected ones are significantly more radio compact. Most of the properties from the GHz-detected (compared to non-detected) remarkably resemble the behavior found in many studies of radio-detected AGNs. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms shaping GHz-detected SF galaxies properties are fundamentally similar. This raises intriguing questions about whether some compact SF galaxies represent a precursor phase of AGN evolution or a form of low-power AGN. The radio compact characteristic sizes of GHz-detected SF galaxies also suggest a connection between AGN and old starburst galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14636v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cluster properties as a function of dynamical state in the DESI Legacy x UNIONS surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Syeda Lammim Ahad, Rashaad Reid, Charlie T.

Using photometrically selected clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey cross-matched with the UNIONS galaxy shear catalogue, we classify clusters as evolved or evolving based on their rest-frame r-band magnitude gaps and stellar mass ratios between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and bright satellites. We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14606v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Dynamics of the Milky Way: Unveiling the 6D Skeleton of Star Formation in the 2040s</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Loredana Prisinzano, Germano G.

How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quiescent galaxies (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the quenching of galaxies using a mock observational lightcone generated from the Semi-Analytic Model (SAM) L-Galaxies, closely matched to observations from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS). The sample is used to study merging, rejuvenation, and visibility times for star-forming, quiescent, and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, to assess the impact on the build-up of the passive galaxy mass functions.
  We find, for example, that a typical PSB ($M_\ast\sim10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$) at $z\approx1$ has a 15 per cent likelihood of merging and around a 25 per cent likelihood of rejuvenating within 1 Gyr of being identified. Applying these rates and timescales to the observational data, we estimate the fraction of quiescent galaxies that passed through a PSB phase. We find that $18 - 28$ per cent of the build-up in the massive end ($M_\ast>10^{10}$\,M$\,_\odot$) of the passive mass function at $1<z<2$ can be explained by PSBs, with the contribution declining to $\sim5$ per cent by $z \simeq 0.5$. Accounting for mergers and rejuvenation reduces the inferred PSB contribution by approximately a factor of two. At lower stellar masses ($M_\ast < 10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$), rapid quenching through a PSB phase explains a significantly larger fraction of the growth in the passive mass function. With a visibility time of $\sim$ 0.75 Gyr, we find that around $60-80$ per cent of low-mass passive galaxies underwent a PSB phase. Our findings provide further evidence that low- and high-mass galaxies follow different quenching pathways.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14592v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV scale with the Pierre Auger Observatory</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eva dos Santos<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extensive air showers produced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays ($E > 10^{18}$ eV) in the Earth's atmosphere provide a challenging yet unique channel to probe hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV center-of-mass energy scale. Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory. With the advent of AugerPrime, we expect to deliver breakthrough results on the 100 TeV-scale hadronic interactions in the next decade.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14546v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy in the 2040s</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Samaya Nissanke, Nikhil Sarin, Chris Copperwheat, Sarah Antier, David Berge, Pablo Bosch, Archisman Ghosh, Paul Groot, Gregg Hallinan, Tanja Hinderer, Kenta Hotokezaka, Theophanes Karydas, Mansi Kasliwal, Yves Kini, Rubina Kotak, Kumiko Kotera, Marek Kowalski, Luke Krauth, Kruthi Krishna, Thomas Kupfer, Paraskevas Lampropoulos, Andrew Levan, Ioannis Liodis, Lea Marcotulli, Kunal Mooley, Silvia Piranomonte, Nanda Rea, Martin Roth, Simone Scaringi, Steve Schulze, Lami Suleiman, Nial Tanvir, Angela Zegarelli, Sylvia J.

The confinement phase transition is described with an effective Polyakov loop model, using the latest lattice data as an input. In particular, recent lattice studies clarified the large-$N$ scaling of the surface tension, which we incorporate through a modification of the kinetic term. We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak.

Dust emission is not detected in any individual source nor in a stack ($<3σ$).

We present a self-consistent two-zone leptonic model in which relativistic electrons accelerate in a compact region, losing energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, and escape into a larger zone permeated by an external photon field associated with magnetohydrodynamic winds from the accretion disk. By varying only the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole, the model naturally reproduces the blazar sequence, including Compton Dominance, $γ$-ray spectral indices, and the positions of synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks, while variations in secondary parameters account for the observed spread in the data. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars exhibit strong external Compton emission from the extended zone, whereas BL Lac objects are dominated by synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from the compact acceleration region. This framework highlights the key role of accretion rate and spatially structured emission zones in shaping blazar spectra and provides a unified interpretation of their diverse phenomenology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14470v1" target="_blank"><h2>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Time-domain astronomy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

The submillimeter ground-state transitions of methylidyne (CH) and water (H2O), both molecules widespread and coeval in the interstellar medium, provide a sensitive test for variations of alpha, the fine structure constant, and mu, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, taking advantage of the unmatched spectral resolution and frequency reliability of radio techniques. We used ALMA simultaneous observations of the two species to constrain any velocity offset between their absorption profiles toward the radio-bright lensed quasars PKS1830-211 (z_abs=0.88582) and B0218+357 (z_abs=0.68466). Our observational setup minimizes instrumental errors and known sources of systematics, such as time variability of the absorption profile and frequency-dependent morphology of the background quasar. The excellent correlation between CH and H2O opacities, the large number of individual narrow velocity components, and the number of independent spectra obtained due to the intrinsic time variability of the absorption profiles ensure that even the chemical segregation bias is minimized. We obtained bulk velocity shifts delta_v = -0.048 pm 0.028 km/s and -0.13 pm 0.14 km/s (1 sigma confidence level) between CH and H2O in the direction of PKS1830-211(NE) and B0218+357(SW), respectively. These values convert into the 3sigma upper limits |Delta_alpha/alpha| < 0.55 ppm and 1.5 ppm, respectively, taking into account the independent upper limits on |Delta_mu/mu| previously obtained for these systems. These constraints on |Delta_alpha/alpha|, at look-back times of about half the present age of the Universe, are two to four times deeper than previous constraints on any other single high-z system.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14372v1" target="_blank"><h2>Surveying Galaxy Clusters (in formation) in the Distant Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

At z$>$2, clusters in formation span tens of Mpc and host gas-rich, dust-obscured galaxies embedded in extended, low-surface-brightness gaseous environments. Current (sub-)millimeter facilities lack the mapping speed, sensitivity, and contiguous field of view needed to trace the cold gas and dust driving rapid galaxy growth across such scales. A future large single-dish observatory with degree-scale coverage, broad spectral access, and high-multiplex capability would enable comprehensive and uniform mapping of entire protoclusters, revealing where star formation is triggered or quenched, and quantifying the cold gas budget, thus providing information on gas cooling within protocluster environments. In synergy with wide-sky optical/NIR surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and Roman, this facility would provide the missing multi-scale and multiphase submillimeter view needed to uncover how the stellar, gaseous, and dark-matter components assemble in protoclusters, completing our view of early structure formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14356v1" target="_blank"><h2>INTEGRAL IBIS catalog of magnetar bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dominik P.

Accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> One of the distinctive properties of magnetars, young neutron stars powered mainly by magnetic energy, is the emission of short ($\lesssim$1 s) bursts of hard X-rays. Such bursts have been observed in nearly all the known magnetars, although at different and time-variable rates of occurrence. In the last two decades, the INTEGRAL satellite has extensively covered with good imaging capabilities the Galactic plane, where most magnetars reside. We present the results of a comprehensive search for magnetar bursts in more than twenty years of archival data of the INTEGRAL IBIS instrument (15 keV - 1 MeV). This led to the detection of 1349 bursts with 30-150 keV fluence in the $\sim2\times10^{-9} - 3\times10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ range from 21 of the 34 examined magnetars and candidate magnetars with well known positions. The durations of the bursts, in terms of $T_{90}$, follow a lognormal distribution centered at $\sim0.1$ s. Most of the detected bursts originated from three particularly active sources: 1E 1547-5408, SGR 1806-20, and SGR 1935+2154. The integral distributions of their burst fluences follow power laws with slopes $β$= 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.95$\pm$0.06, and 0.92$\pm$0.10, respectively. The burst spectra are generally well fit with an exponentially cut-off power law with peak energy $E_{peak}$ in the range $\sim20-60$ keV for SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1935+2154, while the bursts of 1E 1547-5408 are slightly harder ($E_{peak}\sim35-100$ keV). A significant anti-correlation between $E_{peak}$ and fluence is found for SGR 1806-20, which provided the largest number of bursts among the sources of our sample.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14307v1" target="_blank"><h2>Invisible gravitons and large-scale magnetism</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Massimo Giovannini<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 13 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title, abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The large-scale limits on the relic signals of gravitational radiation complement the bounds coming from the interferometric detectors (in the audio band) and from the pulsar timing arrays (in the nHz range). Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14281v1" target="_blank"><h2>Connecting galaxies with their haloes -- from parsec to Mpc scales</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> K.

Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential. Here, we outline the need for wide-field spectroscopic observations of statistically significant samples of nearby galaxies and highlight the key questions that can only be addressed with such data</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 18 papers (18 new, 0 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
