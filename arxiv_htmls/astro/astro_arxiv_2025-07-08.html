the end of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-15$) with unprecedented detail, revealing
their morphologies, sizes, and internal structures. These observations offer
crucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In
this work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a
state-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution
of galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization.
Phoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order
to address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs.
At variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not
employ an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling
model allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around
galaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z
\gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass
relation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass
relation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These
results suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only
mild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a
scenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are
indications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts,
Phoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that
a transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce
later-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to
interpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that
shape galaxy formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03750v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping Galactic Winds and Small-scale Structure in the Circumgalactic

quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and their role in cosmic structure formation.
While spectroscopic redshifts provide high precision, they are impractical for
the vast number of sources detected in large-scale surveys. Photometric
redshifts, derived from broadband fluxes, offer an efficient alternative,
particularly when combined with machine learning techniques. In this work, we
develop and evaluate a neural network model for predicting the redshifts of
QSOs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release
spectroscopic catalogue, using photometry from DESI, the Widefield Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Galactic Evolution Explorer (GALEX). We compare
the performance of the neural network model against a k-Nearest Neighbours
approach, these being the most accurate and least resource-intensive of the
methods trialled herein, optimising model parameters and assessing accuracy
with standard statistical metrics. Our results show that incorporating
ultraviolet photometry from GALEX improves photometric redshift estimates,
reducing scatter and catastrophic outliers compared to models trained only on
near infrared and optical bands. The neural network achieves a correlation
coefficient with spectroscopic redshift of $0.9187$ with normalised median
absolute deviation of $0.197$, representing a significant improvement over
other methods. Our work combines DESI, WISE and GALEX measurements, providing
robust predictions which address the difficulties in predicting photometric
redshift of QSOs over a large redshift range.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05217v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quantitative Morphology of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Optical Imaging</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Qing Liu, Peter Martin, Roberto Abraham, Pieter van Dokkum, Henk Hoekstra, Juan Miró-Carretero, William Bowman, Steven Janssens, Seery Chen, Deborah Lokhorst, Imad Pasha, Zili Shen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 28 figures.

Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have
focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their
morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ
several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics,
angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering
Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical
imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a
multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the
Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at
longer wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\mu m$, WISE 12~$\mu m$, and Planck
radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\HI} column density
map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of
cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible
wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of
mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared
background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers,
cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common
power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical
cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of
angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of
coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in
the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological
signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from
extragalactic light.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05176v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mass Proxy Quality of Massive Halo Properties in the IllustrisTNG and

for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples
realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass
($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii)
soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v)
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to
infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass
conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm
M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general,
scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on
halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c}
> 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$
simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%,
respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for
cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned
likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely
follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to
$0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between
the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations.
Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift
dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5)
property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with
values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a
literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into
context.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03970v1" target="_blank"><h2>Search for spatial coincidences between galaxy mergers and Fermi-LAT

high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers
detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources

4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical
framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match
probabilities $p < 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters
such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and
radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel
high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain
unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and
a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of
AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto
central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at
gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources
among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically
motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work
constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between
gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy
mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in
high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy
pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy

$P(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$ the 21-cm cylindrical power spectrum. However,
the BS foreground wedge, which depends on $(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$,
$(k_{2\perp},k_{2\parallel})$ and $(k_{3\perp},k_{3\parallel})$ the three sides
of a triangle, is more complicated. Considering various foreground avoidance
scenarios, we identify the region where all three sides are outside the
foreground wedge as the EoR window for the 21-cm BS. However, the EoR window is
contaminated by a periodic pattern of spikes that arises from the periodic
pattern of missing frequency channels in the data. We evaluate the binned 3D
spherical BS for triangles of all possible sizes and shapes, and present
results for $\Delta^3$ the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations. The
best $2\sigma$ upper limits we obtain for the EoR 21-cm signal are

the Kolmogorov-like turbulence measured in the simulation yields to velocity
structure functions and line-width that fully compatible with those measured by
the XRISM observation of Coma. These results highlight the combined biases
driven by the inhomogeneity of turbulence in the intracluster medium and by the
X-ray weighting in observations, and appear to release the tension between the
XRISM data and current numerical simulations, showing that a turbulent spectrum
much steeper than Kolmogorov is not required by current observational data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04530v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extreme cloud collisions in nearby barred galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tutku Kolcu, Mattia C.

population of prominent molecular clouds characterised by extremely broad
lines. The physical origin of these ''extended velocity features'' (EVFs) is
still debated, although a connection with the ''dust lanes'' of the Galactic
bar has been hypothesised. In this paper, we search for analogous features in
the dust lanes of nearby barred galaxies using the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) survey.
We aim to confirm existence of EVFs in other galaxies and to take advantage of
the external perspective to gain insight into their origin. We study a sample
of 29 barred galaxies and find that 34% contain one or more EVFs, while the
remaining lack obvious signs of EVFs. Upon analysing the physical properties of
the EVFs, we find they possess large virial parameters, ranging from few
hundreds to several thousand, indicating that they are strongly
out-of-equilibrium. The most likely explanation for their origin is extreme
cloud-cloud collisions with relative velocities in excess of 100km/s in highly
non-circular flow driven by the bar. This interpretation is consistent with
previous high-resolution observations in Milky Way. Further corroboration of
this interpretation comes from the inspection of high-sensitivity infrared
observations from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury Survey that reveals streams of gas
that appear to be hitting the dust lanes at locations where EVFs are found. We
argue that EVFs are the clearest examples of cloud-cloud collisions available
in literature and represent a unique opportunity to study cloud collisions and
their impact on star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04359v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interband Lag Variability in Active Galactic Nuclei across ZTF Data from

been observed over years of monitoring, yet their physical origins remain
unclear. While variable interband lags have been found in a few individual AGN
potentially, the temporal behavior of interband lags of an AGN sample has not
been explored systematically. Here, we analyze the interband lags of 94 bright
AGN at $z<0.8$, using both seasonal one-year and full six-year $gri$-band light
curves from Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 22. We find that more than
half of 94 AGN show significant seasonal variations in the interband lags.
Besides, the short-term lags, derived by averaging lags inferred from multiple
seasonal light curves, are consistently smaller than the long-term lags, which
are inferred from the full six-year light curves. This supports recent
theoretical simulations where the lag measurement is sensitive to the baseline
of light curve and the lag variation could be simply attributed to the inherent
randomness of AGN variability. Our findings suggest that the interband lags of
AGN are more complex and stochastic than commonly thought, and highlight the
importance of high-precision time-domain surveys in uncovering the properties
of AGN variability as well as the associated accretion physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03420v1" target="_blank"><h2>FEAST: probing the stellar population of the starburst dwarf galaxy

4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic
Star clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar
populations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude
diagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different
evolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch
stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial
distributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped
distribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 -
60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent
with the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have
triggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable
ages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field
stars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented
high-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap
between Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the
presence of a massive AGB star "finger". The analysis of these stars can
provide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy.
These results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf
starburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation
and underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in
nearby starburst systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03832v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of cosmic-ray propagation on the chemistry and ionisation

crucial to describe their chemical evolution accurately. However, this
modelling is computationally demanding because it requires the propagation of
cosmic rays throughout the cloud over time. We present a more efficient
approach that simultaneously guarantees a reliable estimate of the cosmic-ray
impact on the chemistry of prestellar cores. We introduce a numerical framework
that mimics the cosmic-ray propagation within gas clouds and applies it to
magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the code GIZMO. It simulates the
cosmic-ray attenuation by computing the effective column density of H$_2$ that
is traversed, which is estimated using the same kernel weighting approach as
employed in the simulation. The obtained cosmic-ray ionisation rate is then
used in post-processing to study the chemical evolution of the clouds. We found
that cosmic-ray propagation affects deuterated and non-deuterated species
significantly and that it depends on the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. We
explored correlations between the electron abundance, the cosmic-ray ionisation
rate, and the abundance of the most relevant ions (HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$,
DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and o-H$_2$D$^+$), with the purpose of finding simple
expressions that link them. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the
ionisation fraction, X(e$^-$), from observable tracers and applied it to
existing observations of high-mass clumps. We obtained values of about
10$^{-8}$, which is in line with previous works and with expectations for dense
clouds. We also provide a linear fit to calculate the cosmic-ray ionisation
rate from the local H$_2$ density, which is to be employed in three-dimensional
simulations that do not include cosmic-ray propagation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04666v1" target="_blank"><h2>Delensing CMB B-modes using galaxy surveys: the effect of galaxy bias

gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for
primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which
induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These
lensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the
E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that
caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys
such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using
them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory,
LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in
principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible
for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition,
non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the
large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these
effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited,
photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using
them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that
pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur
negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show
that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the
galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is
well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario
where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04476v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deciphering Baryonic Feedback from ACT tSZ Galaxy Clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nihar Dalal, Chun-Hao To, Chris Hirata, Tae Hyeon-Shin, Matt Hilton, Shivam Pandey, J.

paper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model
that is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information
on baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the
calibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can
constrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic
feedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a
preference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both
consistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar
analyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the

$<$ 1kpc are crucial to our understanding of SMBH growth, galaxy evolution, and
the evolution of SMBH binaries. Despite their importance, there are less than a
handful known, and most have been discovered serendipitously. In this work, we
employ a new selection method to systematically pre-select candidate advanced
mergers likely to contain unresolved substructure at sub-arcsecond scales. By
exploiting the large survey area and astrometric precision of the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we
have identified a sample of 48 nearby advanced mergers that have red WISE
colors ($W_1-W_2>0.5$) indicative of accretion activity and significant
sub-arcsecond offsets between their optical and infrared coordinates as
measured by SDSS and WISE. We conducted high resolution adaptive optics (AO)
observations of this sample with the Keck NIRC2 camera in the $K_p$ band
($2.124 ~ \mu m$, $\Delta\lambda = 0.351 \mu m$) to search for evidence of
previously unresolved substructure suggested by the optical-to-infared offsets.
We find that a significant fraction (20/48 or 42%) of the sample shows
substructure tracing the SDSS/WISE offset and unresolved by SDSS, demonstrating
that our methodology is a promising pathway to find dual AGN in follow-up
spectroscopy. Archival optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals
that substructure identified with Keck is often missed in the optical or
erroneously identified due to partial obscuration, underscoring the importance
of carrying out studies of late-stage mergers in the infrared.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03230v1" target="_blank"><h2>Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) -
originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly
self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos
undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross
sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds
with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a
semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo
population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH
mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal
Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM
scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their
abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a
mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve
in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$
shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree
simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7}
M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational
tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early
universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter
interactions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04011v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Growth of Little Red Dot Descendants at z<4 with the

galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions
about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline
in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this
study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate
descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a
blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude
selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z<4$, surrounded by young,
blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single
S\'ersic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using
a stellar-only model. These "post-LRD" candidates show LRD-like features with
$M_\ast \sim 10^{10} \ M_\odot $, central densities ($ \Sigma_\ast \sim 10^{11}
\ M_\odot \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but
with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \pm 0.5$ ( $
\sim 10^{-4.15} \, \text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 < z < 7$ ,
supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent
increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\sim 250$ pc at $ z =
5 $ to $\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile,
the core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow.
These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire
an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may
explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower
redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04825v1" target="_blank"><h2>Statistical nuclear spin ratios of deuterated ammonia in the pre-stellar

archetypical pre-stellar core L1544. The core was observed in the two lowest
rotational lines of ortho- and para-NH2D using the APEX and the IRAM 30 m
telescopes. The ground-state lines of ortho- and para-NHD2 were observed with
APEX. The distributions of chemical abundances in the core were predicted using
a gas-grain chemistry model with two different scenarios concerning proton
transfer reactions in the gas. One of the scenarios, the so-called full
scrambling (FS), allows protons and deuterons to be completely mixed in the
intermediate reaction complex before dissociation, whereas the other describes
these reactions as proton or deuteron hops (PH). We also tested assumed
abundance profiles independent of the chemistry models. Radiative transfer
calculations were used to simulate the observed NH2D and NHD2 lines from the
predicted and assumed abundance profiles. Our modelling efforts suggest that
the ground-state lines of NH2D and NHD2 at the wavelength 0.9 mm that are
observable with the same beam and in the same spectrometer band are the most
reliable probes of the o/p ratios. Simulations using the PH reaction scheme
show systematically better agreement with the observations than simulations
with the FS model. Simulations using a broken power law abundance profile as a
function of the gas density give spin ratios that are close to the predictions
of the PH scenario: o/p-NH2D=2.85+-0.05, o/p-NHD2=2.10+-0.06 (1 sigma). The o/p
ratios predicted by the PH scenario in the gas phase correspond to the nuclear
spin statistical weights, that is, o/p-NH2D=3, o/p-NHD2=2. In view of the fact
that H and D atom addition reactions on grain surfaces also result in these
ratios, it is reasonable to assume that the spin ratios of interstellar ammonia
and its deuterated forms are in general equal to their statistical values.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05060v1" target="_blank"><h2>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic

early-type galaxy NGC 2768 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical
radio Telescope (FAST). Leveraging the high sensitivity of FAST, we discover an
extended gas envelope around NGC 2768. The total Hi mass is measured to be 8.1
x 10^8 M_sun , representing a magnitude increase compared to previous
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) studies. Position-velocity (PV)
diagram indicates the envelope mainly involves two components: an Hi disk of
NGC 2768 and a newly discovered satellite galaxy without detectable
counterparts in currently deep optical surveys. The center of the gas disk is
mis-aligned with the optical disk of NGC 2768, with more gas redshifted,
indicating it has been disturbed. Our study indicates NGC 2768 is currently
undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0. Previous deep WSRT
observations reveal two dense clumps (named as Clumps A and Clump B throughout
this paper) in the center of the envelope. We find Clump A corresponds to the
densest part of the disk, while Clump B might be a newly discovered satellite
galaxy which probably collided NGC 2768 about 0.38 Gyr ago. We also find tidal
interactions between Clump B and PGC 2599651, NGC 2768 and UGC 4808. Based on
these new findings, we finally analyze hierarchical accretion history of NGC

observations of the Bullock and Johnston stellar halo simulations to
investigate the sensitivity of HALO7D-X to constrain the basic parameters of
the accretion history of our Galaxy's stellar halo. We find that we are
sensitive to the mass distribution and accretion timeline of the stellar halo
progenitors, but not their orbital circularity. We find that the simulated
halos fall into three different groups based on the similarities in their
distributions of the observable dimensions of our survey. These groups are also
distinct from each other in the mass distribution and accretion timeline of
their progenitor satellites, showing that by using similarities in our
observables among halos, we are able to identify similarities in their
accretion histories. With HALO7D-X we will compare real Milky Way data with
simulated halos and use this connection between observables and progenitor mass
and accretion timeline to learn about the formation of our Galaxy's stellar

structural properties across multiple spatial scales. Galaxies are classified
by specific star formation rate, optical color, and bulge-to-total light ratio,
allowing us to disentangle environmental effects from intrinsic galaxy
properties. We examine the SMR in three contexts: (1) comparing galaxy sizes in
two extreme environments-dense clusters versus cosmic voids; (2) analyzing
cluster galaxies across a range of cluster masses; and (3) studying member
galaxies located in different cluster regions, from the core to the infall
zone. In all three cases, we find no significant dependence of the SMR on
environment at fixed stellar mass and galaxy type. Cluster and void galaxies
follow consistent SMR trends, and no measurable variation is observed with
cluster mass or cluster-centric distance. We also confirm that early-type
galaxies exhibit steeper SMR slopes than late types. Notably, this consistent
lack of environmental dependence on the SMR persists even when accounting for
the differing galaxy number densities in voids, supporting the universality of
this SMR scaling relation across diverse environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03744v1" target="_blank"><h2>Assessing the hierarchical dynamical state of molecular gas: virial

from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of
$10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures
against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity
dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for
a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately,
we do not identify any emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we
find a correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These
findings suggest that gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular

may be responsible for the occurrence of most changing-look active galactic
nuclei (CL AGNs). However, the viscous timescale of a thin disk is far longer
than the observed timescale of CL AGNs. Though this problem can be resolved by
introducing the large-scale magnetic field, the mechanism for radio-quiet CL
AGNs with weak/absent large-scale magnetic field remains a mystery. In this
work, we assume that the thin accretion disk is collapsed from the inner
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) instead of substituting by the outer
thin disk through advection. This idea is tested by comparing the cooling
timescale ($t_{\rm cool}$) of an ADAF with the observed timescale ($t_{\rm
tran}$) of turn-on CL AGNs. We compile a sample of 102 turn-on CL AGNs from the
archived data and calculate the cooling timescale of an ADAF with the critical
mass accretion rate based on some conventional assumptions. It is found that
$t_{\rm cool}$ is much shorter than $t_{\rm tran}$ in most of the CL AGNs,
which validates our assumption though $t_{\rm cool}$ is not consistent with
$t_{\rm tran}$ ($t_{\rm cool}<t_{\rm tran}$). However, this is reasonable since
most of the CL AGNs were observed only two times, indicating that the observed
timescale $t_{\rm tran}$ is the maximum value because the changing-look can
indeed happen before the second observation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05016v1" target="_blank"><h2>Centrally concentrated star formation in young clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Adilkhan Assilkhan, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, Brooke Polak, Ernazar Abdikamalov, Claude Cournoyer-Cloutier, Sean C.

profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence
indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However,
most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the
influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development
of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally
concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \texttt{Torch}
framework, integrating the \texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into
\texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar
evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics.
We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total
mass of $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$, investigating the effects of varying
numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is
shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of
$0.55\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters
initially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile
is consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than
analytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the
central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models
of local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly
ejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends
on the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall
star formation timescale.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03663v1" target="_blank"><h2>LMC-induced Perturbations in the Milky Way Halo:I. HaloDance Simulation

information about both galaxies' masses and structures. We present a suite of
2,848 high-resolution ($10^7$ particles) N-body simulations that systematically
vary the mass and shape of both galaxies' haloes. We model how the mean
velocities and velocity dispersions of halo stars (30--120 kpc) depend on
system parameters, and forecast constraints achievable with current and future
observations. Assuming Gaia DR3-level astrometry, 20 km/s radial velocity
precision, 10% distance precision, and a sample of $\sim$4,000 RR Lyrae stars,
we achieve 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $0.11 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ in MW mass,
$2.33 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ in LMC mass, 2.38 in halo concentration ($c$),
and 0.06 in halo flattening ($q$). These correspond to fractional uncertainties
of 11%, 16%, 25%, and 6% respectively, relative to fiducial values. Improved
Gaia proper motions (DR5) yield modest gains (up to 14%), while adding radial
velocities improves constraints by up to 60% relative to using Gaia astrometry
alone. Doubling the sample size to $\sim$8,000 stars yields an additional 30%
improvement, whereas reducing distance uncertainties has minimal impact
($\le$10%). Mean velocities trace LMC-induced perturbations, while velocity
dispersions constrain MW halo properties, jointly breaking degeneracies. Our
results demonstrate that combining Gaia astrometry with large spectroscopic
surveys will enable precise characterization of the MW-LMC system. This

future work will apply these tools to existing spectroscopic datasets. The full

across cosmic time and a key tool to sharpen investigations of the very early
Universe via delensing. At present, a large fraction of this information is
drawn from the temperature anisotropies, which are ultimately also the most
informative when reconstructing lenses on arcminute scales and smaller. But
extragalactic foreground emission from galaxies and clusters can contaminate
these reconstructions, limiting our ability to use information from small-scale
temperature anisotropies. We develop analytic predictions of the biases from
the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich and cosmic infrared background to CMB lensing
auto- and cross-correlations with low-redshift matter tracers, as well as
B-mode delensing, based on a halo model for the dominant one- and two-halo
contributions to the relevant foreground bi- and tri-spectra. The method is
flexible enough to allow variations in cosmology, astrophysical modeling,
experimental configurations and analysis choices, thus enabling an improved
understanding of the uncertainties involved in current mitigation strategies.
We find that the shape of the bias relative to the CMB lensing auto-spectrum
signal is remarkably insensitive to changes in cosmological and astrophysical
parameter values. On the other hand, the shape appears to depend on $\Omega_m$
for cross-correlations with low-redshift galaxies. We also clarify the ranges
of redshifts and masses that simulations need to resolve in order to capture
these effects accurately. Our code, CosmoBLENDER, is made publicly available.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04320v1" target="_blank"><h2>A gravitational acceleration model to explain the double-peaked narrow

potentially effective gravitational acceleration model to interpret the
double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) shifted in the same direction. We
adopt the framework of a merging kpc-scale dual-core system in an elliptical
orbit, which has an emission-line galaxy with clear narrow line regions (NLRs)
merging with a companion galaxy lacking emission line features. Due to
gravitational forces induced by both galaxies on the NLRs, the accelerations of
the far-side and near-side NLR components may share the same vector direction
when projected along the line-of-sight, leading the velocities of the observed
DPNELs to shift in the same direction. Our simulations indicate that the
probability of producing double-peaked features shifted in the same direction
reaches 5.81% in merging kpc-scale dual core systems containing emission-line
galaxies. Besides the expected results from our proposed model, we identify a
unique galaxy SDSS J001050.52-103246.6, whose apparent DPNELs shifted in the
same direction can be plausibly explained by the gravitational acceleration
model. This proposed model provides a new path to explain DPNELs shifted in the

survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image
quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct
precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric
imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five
scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy
Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph
(IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS).
Using these instruments, the CSST is expected to make significant contributions
and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxy
and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars,
exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable
sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST

J. The first two authors contributed equally</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the role of tidal forces in molecular cloud formation by
examining how apparent boundedness, as diagnosed by the classical virial
parameter, relates to the actual gravitational state of clouds subject to tidal
forces from their environment. Clouds are identified by a dendrogram algorithm
in zoom-in regions taken from a simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with the
Voronoi mesh code AREPO that resolves star-forming regions at sub-parsec
resolution. To look at a range of environments, we use data from three
different regions that evolve differently in the center, near the equivalent of
the Solar circle, and the outskirts of the modeled galaxy, at three different
times, each spaced 2 Myr apart. We compute the importance of tidal forces on
all identified clouds. We then compare the boundedness of clouds including only
their internal potentials to boundedness also including the external
gravitational potential. This comparison shows that tidal forces can unbind
apparently bound clouds and bind apparently unbound clouds. We characterize the
cloud population by comparing their virial parameters to their surface
densities, finding the ratio of the maximum to the minimum eigenvalues of the
tidal tensor, and determining the strength of gravitational instability in each
examined region. We find that it is necessary to take the total gravitational
potential into account rather than just the internal self-gravity of the clouds
to have an accurate understanding of cloud dynamics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03989v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Search for Millimeter-Bright Blazars as Astrophysical Neutrino Sources</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R.

sites of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. However, particulars of the
launched jet and the locations of leptonic and hadronic jet loading remain
unclear. In the case when leptonic and hadronic particle injection occur
jointly, a temporal correlation between synchrotron radiation and neutrino
production is expected. We use a first catalog of millimeter (mm) wavelength
blazar light curves from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope for a time-dependent
correlation with twelve years of muon neutrino events from the IceCube South
Pole Neutrino Observatory. Such mm emission is known to trace activity of the
bright jet base, which is often self-absorbed at lower frequencies and
potentially gamma-ray opaque. We perform an analysis of the population, as well
as analyses of individual, selected sources. We do not observe a significant
signal from the stacked population. TXS 0506+056 is found as the most
significant, individual source, though this detection is not globally
significant in our analysis of selected AGN. Our results suggest that the
majority of mm-bright blazars are neutrino dim. In general, it is possible that
many blazars have lighter, leptonic jets, or that only selected blazars provide
exceptional conditions for neutrino production.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03408v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes from Planck 2018 and

Hayashi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmologically coupled black holes (CCBHs) are alternative black hole models
whose masses evolve as $M \propto a^3$ on cosmological scales. This
characteristic suggests that CCBHs could contribute to the accelerated
expansion of the Universe. In this paper, I consider a CCBH model in which the
cosmological constant is effectively induced, while the baryonic mass is
conserved within conventional black holes. This model is motivated by the
theoretical framework of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes. Assuming that
the accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by CCBHs, I perform a cosmological
parameter estimation using datasets including Planck 2018 CMB, CMB lensing,
BAO, and supernovae. The analysis reveals notable shifts in cosmological
parameters, such as $H_0 = 72.24^{+0.34}_{-0.35} \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, compared
to the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. My $H_0$ constraint is consistent with
the value $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ reported by SH0ES within $1
\sigma$. However, the overall fit to the data worsens, with a total $\chi^2 =
2884.12$ for the CCBH model, compared to $\chi^2 = 2836.12$ for the
$\Lambda$CDM model. I show that the effect of cosmological coupling is
suppressed by a factor of $10^{-16}$ at $\sim$pc scales, rendering it
negligible compared to the standard black hole mass in local astrophysical
phenomena, although the CCBH model can explain the accelerated expansion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04265v1" target="_blank"><h2>Torsion cosmology in the light of DESI, supernovae and CMB observational

$\alpha$ shows a trend of change from $\alpha=0.042^{+0.035}_{-0.031}$ (CMB
alone) to $\alpha=-0.0075\pm0.0058$ (full dataset), while remaining consistent
with zero within $1.7\sigma$. The model demonstrates potential in addressing
cosmological tensions, yielding $H_0 =
68.80\pm0.48~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and reducing the $S_8$ tension from
$0.73\sigma$ to $0.1\sigma$ through its torsion-modified growth equation.
Bayesian evidence analysis shows a clear preference for torsion cosmology in
most dataset combinations, with the notable exception of CMB+DESI+DESY5 which
slightly favors $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, substituting DESY5 with PantheonPlus
data reverses this preference, yielding $\Delta\log\mathcal{Z} = -3.59$ - a
strong indication of the model's viability. While not conclusive, these
findings suggest torsion cosmology merits further investigation as a potential
extension to $\Lambda$CDM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04627v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological Simulations with Massive Neutrinos: Efficiency and Accuracy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Bing-Hang Chen, Jun-Jie Zhao, Hao-Ran Yu, Yu Liu, Jian-Hua He, Yipeng Jing</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

are still debated, and the sources originating them remain an open question.
Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei have gained increasing
attention. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their ability to accelerate
particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations
suggest they may contribute to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We study
the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars proposed as candidate
neutrino emitters, based on a positional cross-correlation analysis between
IceCube hotspots and the 5BZCat catalog. We aim to provide a first
characterization of their central engines and physical nature, to explore the
potential link with neutrino production. We analyze the optical spectroscopic
properties of the 52 candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to infer their
accretion regime. The study is complemented by radio and $\gamma$-ray data,
which trace the intrinsic jet power. We compare the sample to other blazar
populations in the literature, perform statistical tests, and explore, through
simulations, the applicability of methods that include censored data. Overall,
the target sample shows properties compatible with the reference samples. We
observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields,
typical of radiatively efficient accretors, and high radio power. Among them,
24 are detected by Fermi-LAT, spanning various $\gamma$-ray luminosities. We
also show that statistical tests commonly used in the literature need to be
handled with caution, as they are sensitive to the number of censored data and
the sample size.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03758v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of flavor condensate dark matter on accretion disk luminosity in

thermodynamic properties of accretion disks, in a spherically-symmetric and
static background. We focus on a class of models where dark matter originates
from a genuine mass mixing among neutrino fields and compute the corrections to
the dark matter's potential within galactic halo. We find a corresponding
Yukawa correction induced by the dark matter energy-momentum tensor over the
Newtonian potential. In so doing, employing Schwarzschild coordinates, and
adopting the Novikov-Thorne formalism, we compute the geodesic structure and
the corresponding disk-integrated luminosity profiles. Assuming a constant mass
accretion rate, constituted solely by baryonic matter, we find non-negligible
deviations in both the disk structure and radiative output, as compared to the
standard Schwarzschild case. Afterwards, we discuss physical consequences of
our Yukawa correction, comparing it with recent literature, predicting similar
potentials, albeit derived from extended theories of gravity. Accordingly, we
thus speculate to use our results to distinguish among candidates of dark
matter. Indeed, our findings suggest that incoming high-precision observations
of accretion disk spectra may provide a tool to probe dark matter's nature
under the form of particles, extended theories of gravity or condensates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03535v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the axiverse with reionization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ziwen Yin, Hanyu Cheng, Eleonora Di Valentino, Naomi Gendler, David J.

among other channels, freeze-in via the Primakoff process. For sufficiently
large axion masses, the same coupling causes the axions to decay into two
photons, which subsequently ionize the intergalactic medium. If this decay
occurs in the redshift range $20 \lesssim z \lesssim 1100$, then the
contribution to the cosmic microwave background optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$
can lead to a conflict with observations, excluding models with sufficiently
strongly coupled, heavy axions and high reheating temperatures, $T_{\rm reh}$.
Using large ensembles of explicit type IIB string theory models with up to
$h^{1,1} = 100$ axions, we compute the full cosmic reionization history caused
by the decays of multiple axions. We compare this to the posterior on the
high-$z$ component of $\tau_{\rm reio}$ derived from model-independent
constraints on the ionization state of the Universe, obtained in a full
\textit{Planck} analysis presented in a companion paper. For $h^{1,1} = 20, 50,
100$, we find that approximately 15\%, 15\%, and 10\% of the models in the

relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The
cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments,
with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at
the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter
due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the
monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting
recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein,
to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying
our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger
Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array
Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the

scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two
frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric
gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives
rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred
over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB

  production on bound orbits</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhen-Hong Lyu, Rong-Gen Cai, Zong-Kuan Guo, Jian-Feng He, Jing Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and
angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud.
We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$,
with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the
multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that
efficiently produces $\chi$ particles non-perturbatively via parametric
resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than
escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles
remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs
primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in
quasi-circular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to
sustained amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of
$\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by
$(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating
bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the
evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on
binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03808v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stability and Thermodynamics of a Generalized Power-Law Dark Energy
  Model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S. Kazemi, M. A. Ramzanpour, E. Yusofi, A. R. Amani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate a generalized power-law dark energy equation of state of the
form $p = w\rho - \beta\rho^m$ in a flat FLRW universe, analyzing its dynamical
stability and thermodynamic consistency. The model exhibits a rich phase space
structure, with an effective cosmological constant $\rho^* =
[(1+w)/\beta]^{1/(m-1)}$ emerging as a stable attractor for $(w < -1,~ m > 1)$.
Notably, the universe evolves from an early de Sitter phase ($w \to -1$) to a
late-time de Sitter-like one with phantom crossing ($w(z) < -1$), aligning with
DESI observations. Dynamical analysis reveals that the $m > 1$ regime avoids
ghost instabilities while accommodating phantom behavior, with $m = 2$
providing particular theoretical advantages. Thermodynamically, the Generalized
Second Law holds when the null energy condition $\rho + p \geq 0$ is satisfied,
which naturally occurs for $\rho \geq \rho^*$. The model's compatibility with
both observational data and fundamental thermodynamic principles suggests it as
a viable framework for describing late-time cosmic acceleration, resolving
tensions associated with phantom crossing while maintaining entropy dominance
of the cosmological horizon.</p></br></body>
