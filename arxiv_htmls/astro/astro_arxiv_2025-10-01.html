kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity
AGN (LLAGN; $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with a low-power jet.
These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and
reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H$_2$ lines, including bright
pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to $\nu=2$,
probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that
rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an
exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H$_2$
rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of
sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10%
contribution by AGN X-ray heating in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated
with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock
heating, while the inner $\sim$200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by
outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact
of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak,
vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb
molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's
transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25317v1" target="_blank"><h2>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Detection of shock-heated gas beyond the

of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We
present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western
Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA
All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a
statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The
best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms
describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around
r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding
to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to
r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the
assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the
baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas
distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo
center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas
profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic
filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction
exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed
transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that
r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments
connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density
profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG
simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more
efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25309v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-explosive pre-supernova feedback in the COLIBRE model of galaxy

pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation.
The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young,
massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection
from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating
in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets
are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled
self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite
of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous
disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range
$10^4-10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully
regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents
catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence
of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII
regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a
crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes
the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates
the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus
provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates
resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25314v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray shocks in the cool cores of galaxy clusters: insights from

represent a promising mechanism to heat the intracluster gas by converting
kinetic energy into thermal energy through gas compression, thereby offsetting
radiative cooling. Despite their potential importance, such shocks are
challenging to detect, requiring deep X-ray exposures, and have only been
identified in ten clusters. We present the first systematic detection and
characterization of AGN-driven shocks in simulated clusters from the
TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies.
TNG-Cluster exhibits a rich variety of X-ray structures, including realistic
populations of X-ray cavities, as well as shocks, produced by its AGN feedback
model, without collimated, relativistic jets, nor cosmic rays. We produce mock
Chandra observations with deep exposure times, for a sample of 100 clusters,
mass-matched (M$_{500c}=1.2$ - $8.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) to the ten
observed clusters with shocks. Using observational techniques, we identify
shocks through surface brightness edges fitted with broken power laws and
associated density and temperature jumps. We detect 50 shocks in 30 of the 100
clusters, with ~35% hosting multiple shocks. These shocks lie within a hundred
kiloparsec of the central SMBH, are weak (Mach number < 2, median ~ 1.1), and
are associated with cavities in about half of the cases. Both in observations
and in TNG-Cluster, shocks tend to be located at larger radii than cavities,
with median offsets of 46 and 27 kpc, respectively. The observationally
inferred shock powers are comparable to the cluster cooling luminosities
(10$^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting that shocks in the simulation are
crucial heating mechanisms. Our results indicate that shocks play a role as
important as cavities in balancing cooling in cluster cores, acting
isotropically and up to larger distances.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25167v1" target="_blank"><h2>V\textit{z}$-$GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming

CO(\textit{J} = 1 $-$ 0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array,
targeting 92 \textit{Herschel}-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming
galaxies (DSFGs). This flux density-limited sample includes 106 DSFGs in total,
along with 14 galaxies from a recent pilot study -- altogether doubling the
to-date available high-redshift \coonezero observations. These sources cover
redshifts 1 to 6 with available mid/high-\textit{J} CO transitions from the
Northern Extended Millimeter Array \zgal survey. We detect \coonezero emission
in 90/92 targets above signal-to-noise ratio of 2, while two DSFGs remain
undetected. \vzgal also covers additional \cotwoone emission lines in 10 of
these sources. We find gas masses of the entire \vzgal sample to be $\rm
(\alpha_{CO}/{4.0}) \mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times
{10}^{11}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, calibrated using \coonezero line luminosities.
We confirm that these DSFGs -- with derived gas depletion timescales of
$(50-600)$ Myr -- represent a heterogeneous population, potentially comprising
both main-sequence galaxies and starbursts in the early Universe. Using
\coonezero luminosities as an anchor, we robustly derive the CO brightness
temperature ratios with a good statistical significance up to \textit{J} = 6.
Our measurements reveal a broad range of gas excitation conditions across the
\vzgal DSFGs. We also explore [CI](1$-$0)/CO(1$-$0) ratios in 23 \vzgal
galaxies that have existing detections of atomic carbon ground-state emission,
[CI](1$-$0), from the \zgal survey. Our results show similar [CI]/CO ratio
values across cosmic time for starbursts and local star-forming galaxy
populations, supporting the use of \cionezero as an alternative cold gas

Accepted by A&A Letter</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate
occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the
post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$
0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we
propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming
that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris,
or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows
a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be
described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$
main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole.
The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs
and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH.
The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed
pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN,
which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results
suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual
TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25312v1" target="_blank"><h2>Halo Properties from Observable Measures of Environment: II. Central

understanding of the connections between galaxies, their host dark matter
halos, and their environments. In particular, interactions with more-massive
neighbors can leave lasting imprints on both galaxies and their hosts.
Distinguishing between populations of galaxies with differing environments and
interaction histories is therefore essential for isolating the role of
environment in shaping galaxy properties. We present a novel neural-network
based method, which takes advantage of observable measures of a galaxy and its
environment to recover whether it (1) is a central or a satellite, (2) has
experienced an interaction with a more massive neighbor, and (3) is currently
orbiting or infalling onto such a neighbor. We find that projected distances
to, redshift separations of, and relative stellar masses with respect to a
galaxy's 25 nearest neighbors are sufficient to distinguish central from
satellite halos in $> 90\%$ of cases, with projection effects accounting for
most classification errors. Our method also achieves high accuracy in
recovering interaction history and orbital status, though the network struggles
to distinguish between splashback and infalling systems in some cases due to
the lack of velocity information. With careful treatment of the uncertainties
introduced by projection and other observational limitations, this method
offers a new avenue for studying the role of environment in galaxy formation
and evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25363v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Stellar Mass and Age Distributions of Star-Forming Clumps at $0.5 <

galaxies at $0.5<z<5$ in the JWST CANUCS fields. We find that the fraction of
clumpy galaxies peaks near $z\sim2$ for galaxies with masses of
$\log(M_{g,*}/M_\odot)\geq10$, while galaxies with masses of $8.5 \leq
\log(M_{g,*}/M_\odot) < 10$ show lower clumpy fractions with little redshift
evolution. We identify and measure individual clump masses, finding that the
aggregated clump stellar mass function (cSMF) follows a power-law slope of
$\alpha = -2$ across all redshift bins, broadly consistent with
\textit{in-situ} clump formation. However, when split by galaxy masses, the
cSMF is found to be flatter ($\alpha\sim-1.6$) for massive galaxies and steeper
($\alpha\sim-2.3$) for lower mass galaxies, with little redshift evolution in
both cases. We explore how different formation mechanisms and disruptive
processes affect the shape of the clump mass function. In particular, we find
that the cSMF slope is flatter with increasing gas fractions in younger clump
populations ($<300$ Myr old), suggesting that higher gas availability leads to
more massive clumps forming at the time of formation. Alternatively, many
high-redshift galaxies in the sample have disturbed morphologies and
simulations show that clumps of \textit{ex-situ} origins can flatten the cSMF
slope. We also investigate the evolution of clump populations, where we find
the cSMF slope become flatter as clumps evolve and age. We interpret this as an
indication of the long-term survivability of massive clumps, with feedback
mechanisms preferentially disrupting low-mass clumps. Overall, the galaxy-mass
dependent cSMF and age distribution point to a complex history for clumps,
involving different and competing mechanisms for their formation and
destruction.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26556v1" target="_blank"><h2>CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer

the Sun, suggesting differences in the formation and survival of molecules in
star-forming regions. To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way,
deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is
essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We
analyzed IRAM 30m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at
Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the "CHEMical complexity in
star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy" (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on
species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$,
H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities,
abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for
H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2
dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN,
HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental
carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\sim$24 kpc. SO shows a steeper gradient than
sulfur abundance ([S/H]), while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ shows a shallower gradient than
[$^{13}$C/H]. Gas turbulence, inferred from line widths, decreases with
Galactocentric distance, suggesting a more quiescent environment in the outer
Galaxy with respect to the inner Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, the formation
efficiency of most molecules, following the parent element availability, is
comparable or higher (e.g., for H$^{13}$CO$^+$) than in the local Galaxy,
whereas SO forms less efficiently. These results have significant implications
for chemical models of the outermost star-forming regions and for understanding
molecule formation under lower metallicity conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25324v1" target="_blank"><h2>Untangling the Complex Nature of AGN Variability with Fairall 9</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Scott Hagen, Chris Done, Edward M.

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), AGN variability (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The accretion flow in AGN is not well understood, motivating intensive
monitoring campaigns of multiwavelength variability to probe its structure. One
of the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily
monitoring campaign on Fairall\,9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate
AGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\sim 50$ days between years
1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the
average spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger
while the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains
roughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved
analysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc
propagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed
photon flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing
the electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the
hard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the
wrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show
that this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in
both the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via
light travel time. These variability properties, as well as the changes in the
SED, has implications for our understanding of AGN structure and physics, as
well as future monitoring campaigns.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26056v1" target="_blank"><h2>Signatures of dark subhalos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: I.

their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack
of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on
the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs).
Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions
induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density
corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most
massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to
quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial
frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak
parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of
stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ stars
suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M_{\rm subhalo} \lesssim
10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex
signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and
HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency
structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an
interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as
Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$
per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our
results introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in
dSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and
additional dynamical perturbations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26646v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Connection between Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies and the First Massive

to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star
formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible
evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or
submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However,
galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these
populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their
formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In
previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies
semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred
number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new
model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z > 2 and the physical
mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z > 2 were
sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ > 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past.
The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre
flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be
independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve
into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors
lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger
that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting
their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents
further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG
population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding
primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.</p></br></body>
