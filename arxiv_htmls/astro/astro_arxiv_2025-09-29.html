  axion-like particles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Denys Malyshev, Lidiia Zadorozhna, Yuriy Bidasyuk, Andrea Santangelo, Oleg Ruchayskiy</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to PoS Multifrequency Behaviour of High Energy Cosmic Sources - XV (MULTIF2025)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and
potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing
magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic,
energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability
of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the
properties of the intervening magnetic fields.
  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but
uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have
limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets
for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average
over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover
a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing
sensitivity.
  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such
analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that
AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that
time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the
suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that
the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed
spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for
axion-like particles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20832v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic Contrail in NGC 3627 caused by Dwarf Galaxy Candidate or

galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of
200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust
emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size
significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and
exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are
consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6
M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the
disk at >300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its
width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent
interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black

massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21952v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z>6

(JWST) at high redshifts ($z > 6$) have challenged our understanding of the
Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and
evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these
observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the
Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in
weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can
shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at
small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high
redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause
enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced
patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy
astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power
spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing
signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified
astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of
$6.2\sigma$ (and $17.4\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will
enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the
high-redshift observations of JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21532v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling Obscured Accretion in the Local Universe</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Indrani Pal, Stefano Marchesi, Ross Silver, Marco Ajello, Vittoria Gianolli, Núria Torres-Albà, Isaiah Cox, Xiurui Zhao, Dhrubojyoti Sengupta, Anuvab Banerjee, Kouser Imam, Andrealuna Pizzetti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 13 Figures, submitted to the journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), especially Compton-thick
sources with line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H,los}$) $>$ 10$^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$, are critical to understanding supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth
and the origin of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). However, their observed
fraction remains significantly below model predictions, due to strong
absorption bias, even in the hard X-ray (i.e., above 10 keV) band. We analyze a
sample of 26 nearby ($z < 0.1$) AGN from the Swift-BAT 150-month catalog,
selected via mid-IR to X-ray diagnostics and observed with NuSTAR and soft
X-ray telescopes (Xmm-Newton, Chandra, or Swift-xrt). Using self-consistent
torus models (MyTorus, Borus02, and UXCLUMPY), we aim to constrain $N_{\rm
H,los}$, the average torus column density, and other geometrical parameters of
the obscuring medium. A comparative analysis among the three torus models
showed that while estimates of $N_{\rm{H,los}}$ were generally in agreement,
Borus02 tended to classify a slightly larger number of sources as Compton-thick
AGN (CT-AGN). Building on this comparison, we benchmark two prediction schemes
-- a mid-IR/X-ray relation and a machine-learning model -- against our
broadband best-fit $N_{\rm H,los}$ measurements to assess which approach more
effectively bridges the gap between predicted and measured obscuration, finding
that while the former works effectively in the heavily obscured region
(log$\rm{N_H} \gtrsim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$), the latter provides improved
accuracy, particularly for Compton-thin to moderately thick regimes
(log$\rm{N_H} \lesssim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22179v1" target="_blank"><h2>The impact of cosmic filaments on the abundance of satellite galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuxi Meng, Haonan Zheng, Shihong Liao, Lizhi Xie, Lan Wang, Hongxiang Chen, Liang Gao, Quan Guo, Yingjie Jing, Jie Wang, Hang Yang, Guangquan Zeng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 7 figures; Submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical
role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological
simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs
between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE
algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find
that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host
more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative
agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The
average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the
field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude
bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show
that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of
galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments
to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite
abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally,
the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias:
when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the
environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70
\%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference
is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$--$95 \%$. Our results highlight the
importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting
and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21299v2" target="_blank"><h2>Outflow-cloud interaction as the possible origin of the peculiar radio

dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results
from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh
extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact
radio emission, unresolved at a scale of <~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high
brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~> 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral
energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak
flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition
analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region
over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The
radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting
for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard
shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if
dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is
supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow
with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This
work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining
the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those
occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21855v1" target="_blank"><h2>Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT): A

commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of
particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the
central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the
systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited
observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all
available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria
to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range
of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the
underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we
introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting
for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and
leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements.
Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT
robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN
physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves
and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on
two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in
AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21648v1" target="_blank"><h2>BICEP/Keck XX: Component-separated maps of polarized CMB and thermal

  Combined Phase Space and Photometric Analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chuiyang Kong, Ian Dell'Antonio</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 20 figures, submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical
disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space
information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance
score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity
dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures
asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from
observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys.
  To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using
aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate
its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster
Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven
asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is
infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past
mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from
TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational
tracer of merger timing.
  Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at
redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the
position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest
Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a
consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational
data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from
the eROSITA morphology catalog.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22083v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-redshift Merger-induced Bar-like Galaxies in IllustrisTNG</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ewa L.

of barred galaxies at high redshift. Their origin remains unclear and their
presence seems difficult to reproduce in cosmological simulations of galaxy
formation and evolution. In this Letter I present four examples of
high-redshift bars selected from a sample of bar-like galaxies studied
previously using IllustrisTNG simulations. All the galaxies formed their bars
at redshifts z > 3 via mergers with smaller satellites, although one had its
bar formed even earlier, at z > 5. The bars were born long, with lengths on the
order of 3 kpc, and grew in time. Three of the four galaxies were later
accreted by clusters and underwent multiple interactions with their respective
brightest cluster galaxies. Their bar strength was to some extent affected by
these interactions but all the galaxies preserved their bar-like shape until
the present time. By the end of the evolution, all the galaxies lost their gas
and stopped forming stars, they retained essentially no disk component and were
no longer rotationally supported. The examples demonstrate that high-z bars do
not evolve into present-day barred disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way but
rather into S0s or ellipticals typically found in galaxy clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21970v1" target="_blank"><h2>Origin of gas in the Magellanic Bridge: MeerKAT detection of HI 21-cm

source J033242.97-724904.5. In combination with earlier data obtained with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) our new detected HI line permits the
exploration of the MB atomic hydrogen gas across 4-6 kpc. The radial velocity
profiles from the ATCA data and new data from MALS are analysed. Apart from the
excitation conditions, the radial velocity structure of the HI gas seen in
emission and absorption is investigated. Eventually the gas-to-dust ratio is
quantified to identify the origin of the MB gas being either from the SMC
(Small Magellanic Cloud) or the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). The HI absorption
lines towards lines of sight separated by several kpc consistently coincide
with the densest and perhaps coolest gas at the lower radial-velocity limit of
the corresponding HI emission profiles. The gas-to-dust ratio is found to be
consistent with an origin of the MB gas from the LMC. The large scale velocity
distribution as seen from the HI absorption features favors the LMC-SMC direct
collision scenario over the close fly-by scenario, as also currently found by

fraction of star-forming galaxies with 19 star-forming and 11 quiescent
spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies. From Subaru/HSC imaging, we
derived a weak lensing mass of $M_{200} = (1.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{14} \rm
M_\odot$, indicating a low-mass cluster. This is in excellent agreement with
its dynamical mass of $M_{200} = (1.0\pm0.4)\times10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, derived
from SDSS spectroscopic data. XMM-Newton observations reveal that its X-ray
emission is uniform and fully consistent with the astrophysical X-ray
background, with no evidence for an intracluster medium (ICM). The 3$\sigma$
upper limit of $L_{\rm X}(0.1-2.4\rm keV)=7.7\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ on the
cluster's X-ray luminosity falls below the value expected from the $L_{\rm
X}-M_{\rm halo}$ scaling relation of nearby galaxy clusters. We derived
star-formation histories for its member galaxies using the photometric spectral
energy distribution from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE data. Most of its quiescent
galaxies reside within the central 300 kpc, while star-forming ones dominate
the outer region (300 kpc - 1 Mpc). The core region has formed the bulk of its
stellar mass approximately 1.5 Gyr earlier than the outskirts. We infer a long
quenching time of $>3$ Gyr for its quiescent galaxies, consistent with slow
quenching mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or strangulation. These
findings suggest that SDSS-C4 3028 may have undergone an "inside-out" formation
and quenching process. Its ICM may have been expelled by intense AGN feedback
after core formation but before full cluster assembly. The high fraction
($\sim$0.63) of star-forming members likely results from the absence of ram
pressure stripping in this blue cluster, supporting the important role of ram
pressure stripping in quenching galaxies in clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21958v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fermi detection of $γ$-rays from the radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy NGC

$6.22\,\sigma$ (TS = $42.81$). The power-law photon index is $2.61~(\pm 0.24)$,
indicative of a soft spectrum. The star formation activity in NGC 3281 is
insufficient to explain its $\gamma$-ray luminosity based on the empirical
relation between the infrared and $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed in other
sources. The multiwavelength spectrum can be explained as due to inverse
Compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the corona or jet of seed
photons from the corona, disk and torus. The source is Compton-thick and
attenuation of GeV photons due to pair production in the corona is
nonnegligible (with an optical depth of about 10). The intrinsic $\gamma$-ray
luminosity is inferred to be $3.4\,\times10^{42}$ and
$2.2\,\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ for the corona and jet model,
respectively. The observed $\gamma$-ray and radio luminosities is roughly
consistent with the known correlation between the two quantities, among the
lowest luminosity regime. The jet origin is valid only if the radio emission is
dominated by the jet.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22555v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tomographic Distance Measurements to the Smith Cloud with SDSS-V Milky

formation over cosmic timescales. Precise distance measurements are therefore
essential to quantify their mass inflow rates and gauge their exact
contribution to the Galaxy's gas supply. We use a sample of 1,293 SDSS-V BOSS
stellar spectra within 10 degrees of the high-velocity Smith Cloud (SC) to
trace Na I absorption and dust extinction as functions of distance. By fitting
ISM-corrected MaStar templates to each spectrum, we isolate residual equivalent
widths and extinction then compare trends in the SC region to a same-latitude
control field. Stars beyond 1 kpc toward the SC exhibit a significant Na I
equivalent width excess ($>$0.1 Angstroms, $>$3sigma) relative to the control.
Joint fits of Na I equivalent width and Av against both low and high-velocity H
I column densities show that the low-velocity component is strongly correlated
with both quantities, while the high-velocity term is marginally significant in
extinction and consistent with zero in Na I, consistent with a patchy, low

The most massive galaxies are
thought to form their central regions early through violent dissipational
processes, then grow inside-out by accreting smaller satellites. While widely
supported, direct observational confirmation of this process in individual
galaxies remains lacking, except for the Milky Way. We present a detailed
analysis of globular cluster (GC) candidates within a $70^\prime$ ($\sim190$
kpc) radius around the nearest S0 galaxy, NGC 3115, using images in
\textit{g,r,z} bands from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and data from Gaia.
We report the discovery of mass stratification in the GC system (GCS), evident
in two ways: first, the effective radius of the GCS increases monotonically
from the bright to faint end, up to the detection limit near the turnover
magnitude of the GC luminosity function (GCLF); second, the GCLF shows fainter
turnover magnitudes and smaller standard deviations at larger galactocentric
radii. This stratification cannot be readily explained by radial migration or
tidal dissolution, but most likely reflects the hierarchical assembly of NGC
3115's stellar halo, with later-accreted satellites deposited across broader
galactocentric distances. This interpretation is supported by cosmological
simulations of subhalos with comparable mass and bulge-to-total mass ratios and
is consistent with the negative color gradients observed in the GCS.
Additionally, we identify several substructures within the GCS, indicating
ongoing assembly of NGC 3115. This work highlights the power of GCS as tracers
of galaxy assembly and sets the stage for upcoming space-based wide-field
imaging surveys to constrain the assembly of massive galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21233v1" target="_blank"><h2>RadioSED II: discovering the peaked spectrum radio sources in Stripe 82</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  E.

this region, but we increase the number of known peaked spectrum sources here
by more than an order of magnitude. We investigate the variability properties
of our peaked spectrum sample, and find that overall they exhibit a low degree
of variability, consistent with previous samples of peaked spectrum active
galactic nuclei. The multiwavelength properties of these sources reveal that we
have selected a population comprising largely distant ($z \geq 1$), powerful

the $z=5.0167$ galaxy J0148-4214 from JWST/NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy. The black
holes are revealed through broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s)
without a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel
maps of the asymmetric central H$\alpha$ profile isolate two spatially distinct
broad line regions (BLRs), separated by $190\pm40$ pc, while a third BLR is
found in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using
single-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of
$\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=7.9\pm0.4$ (primary central), $5.8\pm0.5$ (secondary
central) and $6.3\pm0.5$ (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central
black holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time
estimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole
is in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a
second merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers
with LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous
three-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would
provide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and
BLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The
discovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent
results on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole
systems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance
of IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in
distant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be
detected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22203v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating solid-state CH3OH formation with chemical modelling</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  K. -Y.

Recent Monte Carlo simulations and laboratory studies of
interstellar ices have proposed an alternative pathway involving the
radical-molecule H-atom abstraction reaction in the overall mechanism of
methanol (CH3OH) formation in dark molecular clouds. Aims. A computational
study was conducted to investigate the contribution of the radical-molecule
H-atom abstraction route in CH3OH formation in interstellar ices, both in
non-shocked and shocked environments, and to examine how the physical
conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) affect the overall CH3OH synthesis
pathway. Methods. A set of chemical models were ran using the gas-grain
chemical code UCLCHEM to systematically explore methanol synthesis in various
physical scenarios, including non-shock and low- and high-velocity C-shocks.
Results. This work demonstrated for the first time that, under non-shock and
shocked-influenced environments, the primary reaction leading to the formation
of methanol in the inner layers of interstellar ices is indeed the
radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route. However, such route is dependent on
the gas kinetic temperature (Tk), gas volume density (nH2 ), velocity of the
C-shock wave (vshock), and cosmic ray ionisation rate ({\zeta}). Furthermore,
gaseous formaldehyde may trace C-type shocks and serve to differentiate
methanol formation pathways in low-velocity C-shocked environments, as its
abundance varies more significantly than that of CH3OH with the inclusion of
the H-atom abstraction reaction in UCLCHEM. The H2CO/CH3OH ratio thus
represents a potential diagnostic tool for this purpose.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20914v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Extended Stellar Distribution in the Outskirts of the Ursa Minor

minor axis of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This study
is enabled by deep, wide Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data, reaching photometric
uncertainties below 0.1 mag at $g,i \sim 26$ mag. Color-magnitude diagrams
along the major and minor axes reveal a clear excess of MS stars beyond the
nominal tidal radius along the minor axis. To characterize this structure, we
derive radial number density profiles in seven azimuthal directions and fit
them with an exponential+power-law function to assess the symmetry of the
extended component. The power-law slopes tend to be shallower toward the minor
axis, though the symmetry remains inconclusive within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties.
This may indicate that the extended component is preferentially distributed
along the minor axis, and could be different from the previously suggested
tidal features along the major axis. Comparing with simulations, we find that
the fraction of stars beyond five effective radii is consistent with
expectations from an intermediate mass ratio merger scenario with a stellar
mass ratio around 6:1. While these findings provide new insights into the
structural complexity and dynamical history of the UMi dSph, alternative
mechanisms such as stellar or supernova feedback have also been proposed for
extended stellar halos in dwarfs and cannot be ruled out.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21763v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping CO Ice in a Star-Forming Filament in the 3 kpc Arm with JWST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Savannah Gramze, Adam Ginsburg, Nazar Budaiev, Alyssa Bulatek, Theo Richardson, A.

cold, dark clouds, much of the CO is locked away in ice. We present JWST
results from observations of a star forming filament (G0.342+0.024) that that
appears to be associated with the 3 kpc arm. This filament is backlit by the
Galactic Center, which has allowed us to construct a high-resolution extinction
map (mean separation between stars of ~1" outside the filament, ~2" in the
filament). ALMA Band 3 data reveals embedded star formation within the cloud.
Using the CO ice feature covered by the F466N band, we map the CO ice column
density of the filament. By combining the extinction map, CO ice column density
map, and archival CO observations, we examine the efficacy of standard CO
X-factor measurements of mass in star forming gas.We find that 50-88% of the CO
is locked away in ice at large column densities ($N_{\rm \rm H_2} \gtrsim
10^{22} \rm ~cm^{-2}, 200 \rm ~M_{\odot} \rm ~pc^{-2}$) in the filament. The
primary sources of uncertainty in this estimate are due to uncertainty in the
ice composition and lab measurements of ice opacities. This shows that
systematic corrections are needed for mass measurements in the Milky Way and
nearby galaxies at high column densities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21822v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Draco Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy in the First Year of DESI Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

circular structure of $\sim$6 pc in diameter, prominent in FIR emission and
enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds traced in CO. It hosts an HII region,
visible in cm emission, and resembles a classical expanding HII bubble
routinely seen in the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line. However, SOFIA FEEDBACK
observations in the spectrally resolved [CII] line reveal instead a slightly
tilted ring of $\sim$10$^3$ M$_\odot$ expanding slowly at $\sim$1.3 km
s$^{-1}$, with a bulk line-of-sight (LOS) velocity near $-2$ km s$^{-1}$. The
central "Diamond" is an unrelated dense clump at $\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$. The
driving source, classified from IR spectroscopy, is a B0.5e star that powers
the HII region. Unlike typical 3D shells, this marks the first case where we
detect only a slowly expanding CII ring. We suggest the HII region and CII
bubble, initially formed by a massive star, expanded outward from a flat slab
of molecular gas nearly in the plane of the sky. The ring is now confined by
swept-up material of the slab, while shell components moving perpendicular to
the LOS have dissipated, leading to a reduction in expansion. Dedicated
simulations tracing the evolution of the CII bubble support this geometry,
consistent with previous reports of HII region evolution in flat molecular
clouds. We propose that the "Diamond Ring" represents the terminal phase of an
expanding CII bubble driven by stellar winds and thermal pressure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20898v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing redshift-dependent systematics in the Hubble tension:

using the latest observational data from multiple cosmological probes. By
combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the second data
release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2), cosmic
chronometer $H(z)$ data, and the Pantheon Plus Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
sample, we reconstruct the cosmic expansion history through Gaussian process
regression without assuming a specific cosmological model or relying on sound
horizon calibration. Our analysis incorporates the complete covariance
structure of the measurements and yields $H_0$ constraints at five distinct
redshifts: $65.72 \pm 1.99$ (z=0.51), $67.78 \pm 1.75$ (z=0.706), $70.74 \pm
1.39$ (z=0.934), $71.04 \pm 1.93$ (z=1.321), and $68.37 \pm
3.95~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (z=1.484). The optimal combination of these
measurements gives $\hat{H}_0 = 69.0 \pm 1.0~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ with
1.4\% precision, which occupies an intermediate position between the Planck CMB
result and the SH0ES local measurement and is consistent with the TRGB result.
Rather than providing a single integrated $H_0$ value, our approach delivers
independent constraints at multiple redshifts, thereby enabling a detailed
investigation of potential redshift-dependent systematic effects that could
contribute to the Hubble tension. We identify significant correlations between
adjacent redshift bins ($\rho = -0.033$ to $0.26$), primarily arising from the
BAO covariance and reconstruction effects. These results demonstrate a clear
redshift evolution in Hubble constant measurements and suggest that the Hubble
tension may involve more complex redshift-dependent effects than a simple
dichotomy between early and late universe probes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22311v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn -- morphological classifications for over 41,000

low-resolution spectroscopic (medium-band) data from the 7-Dimensional Sky
Survey (7DS). By leveraging 40 densely sampled filters with widths of full
width at half maximum (FWHM) = 25 nm, we create 7DS mock catalogs and estimate
the redshift accuracy for three 7DS main surveys: Wide-field Time-Domain Survey
(WTS), Intensive Monitoring Survey (IMS), and Reference Image Survey (RIS).
Using photometric redshifts calculated from EAZY, we find that the five-year
WTS provides reliable photometric redshifts with an normalized median absolute
deviation (${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$) ranging from 0.003 to 0.007 and a
catastrophic failure fraction ($\eta$) from 0.8% to 8.1% at $19 \leq m_{625} < 22 $. 
The spectral resolution R ~ 50 of the medium-band dataset effectively
captures the 4000 {\AA} break and various emission lines. We also explore the
synergy with data obtained from Pan-STARRS1, VIKING, and SPHEREx surveys.
Combining the SPHEREx all-sky data with WTS significantly improves the accuracy
of photometric redshift estimates, achieving {\eta} = 0.4% and
${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$ = 0.004 for fainter sources at higher redshifts. The
additional near-IR information provided by SPHEREx and VIKING plays an
essential role in resolving degeneracies between low and high redshifts. We
also observe color excesses by subtracting adjacent broad-band data, which
improves the confinement of photometric redshifts and aids in the detection of
strong emission line galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21213v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Light Dark Matter with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shao-Feng Ge, Liang Tan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, and 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), galaxy formation (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the possibility of using the cosmic gravitational focusing

in the outflows of evolved stars, such as HD 44179, which produces the Red

corannulene C20H10, a viable candidate for radio detection due to its large

within cosmic filaments can be detected. However, because of the signal's
weakness, stacking techniques are necessary. We assessed two stacking
methods--pair stacking and filament stacking--using the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG
simulations. Pair stacking leverages the fact that cosmic filaments serve as
the connectors between cosmic web nodes, while filament stacking directly
aggregates cosmic filaments identified by galaxy distributions. Our analysis
indicates that, although pair stacking is convenient, it faces contamination
from massive structures, the signal from filament gets very weak after the
contamination is removed. Conversely, HI detection via filament stacking
appears more viable. The column density exceeds $10^{17} \,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ even
when all halos are masked, and it is nearly 10 times higher than what is
achieved with pair stacking. The effectiveness of filament stacking could
further increase with a high number density galaxy catalog and better spatial
resolution in radio observation intensity mapping. With the advent of new

large relative velocities at the centres of dense clusters are expected to
reduce the likelihood of mergers for satellite galaxies. Tidal features probe
the recent merger histories of galaxies. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce an unprecedented sample of tidal
features around millions of galaxies. We use LSST-like mock observations of
galaxies at $z\sim0$ from the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG and Magneticum Pathfinder
cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations to predict the occurrence rates of
tidal features around satellite galaxies across group and cluster environments
in the velocity-radius projected phase-space diagram to investigate the impact
of these environments on tidal feature occurrence. We find that ancient
infallers in the projected phase-space exhibit a decreasing tidal feature
fraction with increasing halo mass, whereas recent infallers in the projected
phase-space show unchanging tidal feature fractions with halo mass. Our results
show, for the first time in cosmological simulations, a suppression of tidal
feature fractions in the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating a
reduced merger rate due to higher cluster-centric velocities and lower galaxy
total masses in the cluster centres. Using a toy model, we show that the
presence of more tidal features in the recent infaller zone and cluster
outskirts suggests that tidal features occur in interactions within infalling
groups and dissipate by the time they are ancient infallers, indicating a
$\lesssim3\pm2$ Gyr survival time of tidal features within clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21109v1" target="_blank"><h2>A new era for multi-wavelength studies of blazars with Rubin and the
  CTAO</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Julian Hamo, Jonathan Biteau, Julien Peloton</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025), 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Both the Rubin Observatory and the first telescopes of the CTAO will be
collecting data by 2026, marking a new era in optical and gamma-ray astronomy.
Compared to predecessors, their enhanced sensitivity will extend extragalactic
observations to a redshift of at least 2.5. This advancement offers insights
into non-thermal astrophysical sources, particularly blazars. The 3-night
cadence monitoring with Rubin, in one of its six filters, will produce blazar
light curves that, when combined with targeted in-depth observations from the
CTAO, could help distinguish acceleration and radiative models. Existing data
from the ZTF and Fermi-LAT, though less sensitive, offer insights into what
Rubin and the CTAO may achieve. However, the real-time processing of the
immense data stream coming from Rubin/LSST presents a major challenge.
  Addressing this challenge is the work of brokers such as Fink, which we
develop for multi-messenger astrophysics. Fink processes data in real-time
before sending relevant information to other observatories like the CTAO. In
this contribution, we present how we characterize the optical variability of
blazars that emit in the gamma-ray range using the ZTF, with timescales
spanning from the intra-night to multi-years. We identify properties in the
resulting parameter space that could not only enable the identification of
blazar-like sources, but also the characterization of the continuum of states.
We describe our fast identification of transitions from one state to another,
enabling the trigger of observations in the gamma-ray band and follow-up
spectroscopic observations. Finally, we review the communication channel we set
from the ZTF to the CTAO via Fink for blazars and discuss its outlook in light
of the Rubin Observatory. This method is also applicable to other astrophysical
sources and helps lay the groundwork for a fruitful era for time-domain
astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21852v1" target="_blank"><h2>The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: Influence of Mergers on Radial Profiles of

variations of the specific Star Formation Rate (sSFR), Star Formation
Efficiency (SFE), and molecular gas fraction (fmol ) in galaxies. We analyse 33
isolated galaxies and 34 galaxies in four different merger stages from pairs,
merging galaxies, post-mergers, and merger remnants. Our sample is included in
the EDGE-CALIFA survey, which provides spatially resolved optical
integral-field unit and CO spectroscopy data. We show that, in comparison with
the isolated sample, the mergers increase the molecular gas fraction
non-uniformly across different galactocentric distances. Also, we find that the
main driver (efficiency or molecular gas) of both enhanced and suppressed star
formation changes independently of galactocentric radius and merger stage.
However, efficiency appears to be the primary driver of variations in star
formation (except during the merging stage), where we find an enhancement in
star formation driven by the available fuel. Our results suggest that in
interacting and merging galaxies, the efficiency plays a crucial role in the
star formation variations throughout the galaxy, regardless of the available
molecular gas content.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20966v1" target="_blank"><h2>Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoabsorption Spectra of Icy Isoprene and its

other complex organic molecules, in the diverse environments of the ISM and in
our solar system. Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules
at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these
molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the
vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of
isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\alpha$-pinene and
$\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these
experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene
and its oligomers, limonene, $\alpha$-pinene, and $\beta$-pinene. VUV
photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities
in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent
red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of
isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its
candidature for detection on icy bodies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21141v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-Driven Inverse Cascade</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jiyao Zhang, Axel Brandenburg</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various
astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar
dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early
universe. A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at
intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral
peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have
already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and
demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density
$\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have
$E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where
$C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient
analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct
simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the
forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid
resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and
corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and
investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$. For the
$C_\mathrm{H}$ - $Lu$ relationship, we observe strong correlations with
power-law exponents of 1 and 2/3. In contrast, we find no significant

heavy molecules such as CO are strongly depleted in their cold, dense
interiors, limiting the ability to probe core centers. Deuterated molecular
ions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is
enhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of
ortho-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um
continuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the
previously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central
ortho-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\sigma$ contrast and an inferred
diameter $\lesssim$600au, together with a peak
$x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred
profiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a
deuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+
depletion is only marginally matched within the $2\sigma$ upper limit, likely
suggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we
infer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that
the substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather
than slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that
ortho-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly
thermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few
free-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions
for both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21142v1" target="_blank"><h2>A LOFAR search for coherent radio emission accompanying prompt engine

transient events, yet the fundamentals of jet composition and radiation
mechanisms remain unclear. One means of identifying a magnetically-dominated
outflow would be detection of prompt, coherent radio emission at low
frequencies, and we are able to search for this using the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) coupled with modelling of high energy pulses detected by the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). We present the rapid response mode follow-up
LOFAR observations of four long GRBs, each beginning within a few hundred
seconds of the initial Swift-BAT trigger. We interpreted our findings under the
framework of a magnetic wind model, predicting coherent radio emission
analogous to prompt emission pulses. Using 60 second and 180 second time sliced
imaging at 120-168 MHz, we obtain upper limits on radio pulse emission, finding
no significant signals. In the case of GRB 200925B, we observed a small
increase of radio flux seen at $\sim$60-360 s post burst. In this model, this
could represent the radio emission related to the Swift-BAT pulses, for a
redshift of $z=1.8$, however, with a low signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 2$, it
is not deemed significant enough to confirm coincident prompt radio and
gamma-ray emission. Instead, we can constrain the $\epsilon_{B}$ parameter,
deriving upper limits of $\epsilon_{B} < 4.2 \times 10^{-4}$ for GRB 200925B.
In GRB 240414A, with a reported redshift of $z=1.833$, we constrain
$\epsilon_{B} < 2.8 \times 10^{-4}$. We discuss these results in the context of
our whole LOFAR rapid response sample of six long gamma-ray bursts, finding our
$\epsilon_{B}$ values are generally consistent with previous GRB studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21236v1" target="_blank"><h2>Limitations on Morphological Fitting for JWST "Little Red Dots"</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kelly E.

``little red dots'' (LRDs). The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often
invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their
conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability
of pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies --
to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the
F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input
parameters for simulated images with SNR $\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF
fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD
compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\lesssim
50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic
extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results
for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely
high-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and
two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock
sample fitting. We find that $\sim85\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated,
consistent with the AGN-dominated interpretation. The remaining $\sim15\%$ have
low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $\gtrsim 150$ pc
(Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the
population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of
sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary
population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely
compact starbursts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22419v1" target="_blank"><h2>Choked jets in BSG/RSG as possible sources of high-energy neutrinos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Matteo Pais, Angela Zegarelli, Silvia Celli, Enrico Peretti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in Proceedings of Science, PoS(ICRC2025)1138 (Multi-messenger emission from choked jets in collapsars)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The death of massive stars is accompanied by the formation of central and
accreting compact objects and the subsequent launch of relativistic jets.
However, not all jets successfully drill their way out of the stellar envelope.
Unsuccessful jets, also known as choked jets, may still produce radiation at
lower frequencies by dissipating the jet energy into a pressurized cocoon. This
cocoon expands within the stellar envelope and eventually breaks out as a
mildly relativistic outflow. We investigate the plasma physics in the
surroundings of massive collapsing stars harboring choked jets via
relativistic, non-resistive MHD simulations. As a result, we define the
parameter space allowing for jets to remain choked, and we quantify the
acceleration rate and efficiency for charged particles in the strong shocks of
such astrophysical environments. Preliminary results show that high Mach
numbers ($\sim 100$) after 5-10 seconds of constant energy injection
characterize the forward shock, possibly allowing for efficient particle
acceleration and high-energy neutrino production. Our results are presented for

flare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a
time-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results
from the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87,
whereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec

Its long-term multi-band light curve data show flicker-like variations, but in
a well-sampled $g$-band light curve, we are able to determine a $\simeq 329$\,d
quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at a $\sim$4.53$\sigma$ significance. Six
optical spectra were obtained for the source, three of which were taken by us.
The spectra show that the variations were mainly because of flux changes
blueward of 4000\,\AA. We also analyze X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data obtained
with {\it the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift)}, which targeted the
source in the past two years. X-ray and UV emissions of the source show
variations correlated with optical. Time lags of four UV bands and four optical
bands are determined with respect to the X-ray emission, which are consistent
with a continuum reprocessing disk model. These properties point out a disk
origin for the QPO, likely due to Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of the
accretion flow at $\sim$20 gravitational radii of the BH. This QPO could be a
key case linking sub-year long QPOs in jets, which have more cases reported, to
LT precession.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21686v1" target="_blank"><h2>Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos (ARCH): Integrating Shear and

gravitational lensing pipeline for cluster mass reconstruction that applies a
joint shear-flexion analysis to JWST imaging. Previous approaches have explored
joint shear+flexion reconstructions through forward modeling and Bayesian
inference frameworks; in contrast, ARCH adopts a staged optimization strategy
that incrementally filters and selects candidate halos rather than requiring a
global likelihood model or strong priors. This design makes reconstruction
computationally tractable and flexible, enabling systematic tests of multiple
signal combinations within a unified framework. ARCH employs staged candidate
generation, local optimization, filtering, forward selection, and global
strength refinement, with a combined fit metric weighted by per-signal
uncertainties. Applies to Abell 2744 and El Gordo, the pipeline recovers
convergence maps and subcluster masses consistent with published weak+strong
lensing results. In Abell 2744 the central core mass within 300$h^{-1}$ kpc is
$2.1\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$, while in El Gordo the northwestern and
southeastern clumps are recovered at $2.6\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$ and
$2.3\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$. Jackknife resampling indicates typical
1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot h^{-1}$, with the all
signal and shear+$\mathcal{F}$ reconstructions providing the most stable
results. These results demonstrate that flexion, when anchored by shear,
enhances sensitivity to cluster substructure while maintaining stable

donor star. The NS accretes matter from the donor star producing pulsed X-ray
emission. In most cases the donor stars are Be stars, and accretion is
episodic, that is, the NSs are generally X-ray dim, but occasionally experience
outbursts. Here, we carry out a statistical study with the X-ray monitoring
data, and obtain strong correlations between the spin periods of the NSs and
the outburst parameters for the first time. We show that XRPs containing faster
rotating NSs tend to display more violent eruptions. In addition, pulsating
ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies follow the similar relationship.
We demonstrate that most of these systems are close to the spin equilibrium,

core-collapse explosions and provide a valuable window into the physical
mechanisms governing the deaths of massive stars. However, estimates of
explosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension
with the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular,
when based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to
specific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass
progenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\rm K}$), far
exceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase
(nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor
($M_{\rm He\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break
degeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of
32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs
with arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed
wind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters,
we find that the tension between the observed $M_{\rm He\,core}$-$E_{\rm K}$
and $E_{\rm K}$-$M_{\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven
explosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular
spectroscopy in light curve modeling. This study highlights the crucial role of
nebular spectroscopy in interpreting SNe II observations and provides support
to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism as the dominant engine powering
these events.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20718v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hybrid Strategy for Coordinated Interstellar Signaling: Linking the
