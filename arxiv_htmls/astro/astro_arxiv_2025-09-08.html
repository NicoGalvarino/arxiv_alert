features three accretion disc states (the thick, thin, and slim discs at low,
moderate, and super-Eddington accretion rates, respectively), and two feedback
modes: thermal isotropic and kinetic jets. The model includes black hole (BH)
spin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and
Lense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects
the feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and
coupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results
from hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing
on the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid
AGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive
galaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\approx10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. BH
spins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs
($M_\mathrm{BH}\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), and lower for other BH
masses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic
medium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback
simulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback. In the hybrid AGN
simulations, we predict that half of the cumulative injected AGN energy is in
thermal and the other half in jet form, broadly independent of BH mass and
redshift. Jet feedback is important at all redshifts and dominates over thermal
feedback at $z<0.5$ and $z>1.5$, but only mildly.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04553v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing the roles of transitory obscured phases and inner torus

of contention. It is unclear whether obscured AGN are primarily due to
line-of-sight effects, a transitory, dust-enshrouded phase in galaxy evolution,
or a combination of both. The role of an inner torus around the central SMBH
also remains unclear in pure Evolution models. We use cosmological
semi-analytic models and semi-empirical prescriptions to explore obscuration
effects in AGN at 1<z<3. We consider a realistic object-by-object modelling of
AGN evolution including different light curves (LCs) composed of phases of
varying levels of obscuration, mimicking the possible clearing effects of
strong AGN feedback. Evolution models characterized by AGN LCs with relatively
short pre-peak obscured phases followed by more extended optical/UV visible
post-peak phases, struggle to reproduce the high fraction of obscured AGN at
z~2-3 inferred from X-ray surveys. Evolution models characterised by LCs with
sharp post-peak declines or persistent or multiple obscuration phases are more
successful, although they still face challenges in reproducing the steady drop
in the fractions of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity measured by some
groups. Invoking a fine-tuning in the input LCs, with more luminous AGN defined
by longer optical/UV visible windows, can improve the match to the decreasing
fractions of obscured AGN with luminosity. Alternatively, a long-lived central
torus-like component, with thickness decreasing with increasing AGN power,
naturally boosts the luminosity-dependent fractions of obscured AGN, suggesting
that small-scale orientation effects may still represent a key component even
in Evolution models. We also find that in our models major mergers and
starbursts, when considered in isolation, fall short in accounting for the
large fractions of highly obscured faint AGN detected at cosmic noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04584v1" target="_blank"><h2>Witnessing the violent, merger-driven formation of an extremely massive

(HST) with archival observations of molecular gas to study SDSS
J160705.16+533558.6 (J1607), an extremely luminous broad-line quasar at $z =
3.65$ that is also bright in the submillimeter (sub-mm). Via subtraction of the
quasar point spread function, we show that its host galaxy is massive, with a
stellar mass of $(5.8 \pm 3.0) \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, making it
comparable to giant early-type galaxies (ETGs) at $z\sim0$. If the supermassive
black hole (SMBH) in the quasar is accreting at the Eddington limit, then its
mass is $3.5 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is also consistent with local
massive ETGs. The host has an extremely high star formation rate (SFR) of $4300
\pm 500$\sfr and a molecular gas mass of $(2.4 \pm 0.9)\times 10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$. The quasar has two companions: one at a projected separation of 11
kpc with a stellar mass of $(7.9 \pm 5.0) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no
detected molecular gas, and one 6 kpc further away in the same direction with a
molecular gas mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.3) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no
detected stellar emission. Since neither companion shows evidence for AGN
activity, this may represent merger-driven quenching, in which the dynamics of
the merger strip molecular gas from infalling galaxies. Overall, irrespective
of whether the host is merging with the companions, these properties mark J1607
as forming what will become an extremely massive ($\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$)
galaxy by $z=0$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04563v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-resolution Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope H{\sc i} 21\,cm imaging

the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT \hii\ images have
spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find
evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a
nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances
in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and
(iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of
NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low
metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in
the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over
the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The
above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas,
via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst
and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in
NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of
FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT
H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of
FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the
H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase.
Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A
yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $<3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on
the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source
associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio

radio-powerful quasar RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 using uGMRT, ATCA, LBA, and
Chandra. The observed radio properties are in line with what is typically
observed in high-$z$ radio quasars ($\alpha_{\rm r}=0.72\pm 0.02$ and L$_{\rm
1.4GHz}=5.8 \pm 0.9 \times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). Despite the relatively low
X-ray flux observed $F_{\rm 0.5-7.0 keV}=2.3\pm0.5 \times 10^{-14}$ erg
sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, the intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 keV rest frame is
markedly high, $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}=1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7} \times 10^{46}$ erg
sec$^{-1}$, making RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 one of the most luminous quasars
currently known at $z>5.5$. The high X-ray luminosity is largely driven by an
extrapolation to energies below the observable X-ray window with Chandra and
the slope derived in the 0.5-7 keV band (or 3.5--50 keV in the rest-frame;
$\Gamma_{\rm X}=3.3\pm0.4$). By analysing the overall spectral energy
distribution of the quasar we found that the remarkably soft X-ray emission:
(1) cannot be produced by relativistic jets, even when relativistic boosting is
considered; and (2) is consistent with expectations for a super-Eddington
accreting SMBH. If such a high accretion rate was confirmed, this source would
be a unique laboratory to study high accretion in the early Universe and could
help resolve some challenges inherent in early black hole growth paradigms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04567v1" target="_blank"><h2>The atomic gas properties of Green Pea galaxies: Connections to Lyman

detections of H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission and 17 upper limits on the H{\sc{i}}

use the line luminosity ratio O32~$\equiv$~[O{\sc iii}]$\lambda 5007+\lambda

($\approx53^{+16}_{-13}$\%) for the 32 GPs with O32~$<10$ than that
($7.1^{+9.4}_{-4.6}$\%) for the 28 GPs with O32~$>10$. We find statistically
significant evidence that the H{\sc{i}} mass, the H{\sc{i}}-to-stellar mass
ratio, and the H{\sc{i}} gas depletion timescale of GPs with O32~$>10$ are
lower than the corresponding values for GPs with O32~$<10$. Earlier studies
have shown that galaxies with O32~$>10$ tend to show significant LyC leakage:
our results indicate that this is due to the lack of H{\sc{i}} in such
galaxies, with most of the H{\sc{i}} consumed in the starburst. Our results
further suggest that H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm studies of the galaxies that reionized
the Universe at $z\gtrsim6$ are likely to find an anti-correlation between the
H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm and Ly$\alpha$ emission signals, due to the paucity of

delivering feedback over a broad range of scales. However, modeling CR
transport remains challenging due to its inherently multi-scale nature and
complex microphysics. Recent advances in two-moment CR hydrodynamics have
alleviated some of these challenges, improving understanding of CR feedback.
Yet, current two-moment methods may not be able to directly incorporate all
relevant CR transport processes, while the outcome of CR feedback sensitively
depends on these underlying microphysics. Furthermore, numerical challenges
persist, including instabilities from streaming terms and ambiguities in solver
design for coupled CR-MHD systems. In this work, we develop a two-moment
description for CR hydrodynamics from first principles. Beyond canonical CR
streaming, our formulation accounts for CR pressure anisotropy and Alfv\'en
waves propagating in both directions along the magnetic field, providing a
general framework to incorporate more CR transport physics. We implement this
framework as a new CR fluid module in the \textit{Athena}++ code, and validate
it through a suite of benchmark tests. In particular, we derive the full
dispersion relation of the two-moment CR-MHD system, identifying the
CR-acoustic instability as well as other wave branches. These CR-MHD waves
serve as rigorous benchmarks and also enable the use of realistic signal speeds
in our Riemann solver. We propose a time step guideline to mitigate numerical
instabilities arising from streaming source terms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05172v1" target="_blank"><h2>The diverse quenching pathways of post-starburst galaxies in SDSS-IV

Carnall, Yanmei Chen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in MNRAS. Main text: 17 pages, 8 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title), ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The quenching of star formation in galaxies is an important aspect of galaxy
evolution, but the physical mechanisms that drive it are still not understood.
Measuring the spatial distribution of quenching can help determine these
mechanisms. We present the star-formation histories (SFHs) and stellar
metallicity evolution of rapidly quenched regions in 86 local post-starburst
(PSB) galaxies from the MaNGA integral field survey, obtained through Bayesian
full spectral fitting of their rest-frame optical spectra. We found that
regardless of spatial location, the PSB regions have similar past SFHs and
chemical evolution, once radial metallicity gradients are accounted for. This
suggests that all PSB regions are regulated by a common set of local scale
processes in the interstellar medium, regardless of the broader triggering
mechanism. We show that the centres of galaxies with outer PSB regions are also
quenching. The central specific star-formation rate (sSFR) has declined by
$\sim1.0\;$dex on average during the last 2 Gyr, a significantly steeper
decline than main sequence galaxies over the same period ($\approx0.2\;$dex).
This central quenching can be either synchronous, outside-in or inside-out, and
slower or as fast as the outer regions, highlighting the diversity of quenching
pathways for local galaxies. Our results imply a primary quenching mechanism
that is both catastrophic and global in rapidly halting star formation in local
galaxies. We suggest the predominant cause is galaxy mergers or interactions,
with large scale feedback from a starburst or a central supermassive black hole
playing a lesser role.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05096v1" target="_blank"><h2>An emulator-based forecasting on astrophysics and cosmology with 21 cm

its cross-correlation with other tracers of cosmic density, are promising
probes of the high-redshift Universe. In this study, we assess the potential of
the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter
density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the
reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves
emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling
efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving
semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift
($z = 7.0$) for $k$-modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We
generate $\sim7000$ training samples by varying both cosmological and
astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy
when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves
five free parameters: three cosmological ($\Omega_m$, $h$, $\sigma_8$) and two
astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, $\zeta$, and minimum halo mass,
$M_{\mathrm{min}}$). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we
create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators.
Assuming a 5% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find
that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble
parameter ($h$) to better than 6% at a confidence interval of 95%, with tight
constraints on the global neutral fraction ($Q_{\mathrm{HI}}$). The inclusion
of bias information further improves constraints on $\sigma_8$ (< 10% at 95%
confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and
a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization
fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints
weaken.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04221v1" target="_blank"><h2>SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium. II.

which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is evolving. Previous
estimates have put the age of the LB at $\gtrsim 14\,\text{Myr}$, and suggested
that its expansion was powered by $\sim 15-20$ SNe, yet in a companion paper we
have seen hints that this age might be too high. Following up on these hints,
we aim to place new constraints on the age of the LB. We reconstruct the
geometry and momentum of the LB using publicly available 3D dust maps to
compare its geometry to that of the high-quality sample of simulated supernova
remnants in the SISSI project. We find that, in contrast to previous estimates,
$\gtrsim 20$ SNe over $\sim 4\,\text{Myr}$ are required to explain both the
momentum and the size of the LB. The julia source-code for our analysis is made
available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17054923. Previous estimates of the
age of the LB have seemingly overestimated its age and underestimated the
number of SNe powering its expansion. Our results are in tension with the
assumption that the LB is powered solely by SNe associated with the nearby
Scorpius-Centraurus OB association, which appears to have stopped forming stars
at about the same time as the LB began to expand. In light of this new
evidence, our results cast serious doubts on the claim that star formation in
the solar neighborhood was driven by the expansion of the LB, and might have
instead quenched it.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04562v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nuclear Stellar Discs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mathias Schultheis, Mattia C.

derive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and
compare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The
relationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including
nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role
of NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted,
emphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such
as their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves
as a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve
individual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics,
dynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of
a nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue
that NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven
gas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas
during a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions,
future research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming

interferometers, such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, have led to the discovery of new
classes of extended radio sources of unknown origin, including the so-called
Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). These phenomena are detected exclusively in the radio
continuum, with no clear counterparts at other wavelengths, making their
physical nature and origin a subject of ongoing investigation. To better
understand these objects, we study their radio continuum emission, spectral
characteristics, and magnetic field properties. In this work, we present a
radio spectropolarimetry analysis of a newly discovered ORC (ORC J0356-4216)
that exhibits a rare double-ring morphology. We use data from the MeerKAT
L-band and from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) at 943 MHz.
ORC J0356-4216 shows a symmetric double-ring structure with a diameter of
approximately 2 arcminutes, corresponding to a physical size of 668 kpc based
on the redshift ($0.494 \pm 0.068$) of its apparent host galaxy WISEA
J035609.67-421603.5. The radio spectra of both rings are steep, with spectral
indices of $-1.18 \pm 0.03$ and $-1.12 \pm 0.05$, and show no significant
substructure. Equipartition magnetic field strengths (assuming K0 = 1) are
estimated to be 1.82 microGauss and 1.65 microGauss for the respective rings.
The degree of polarisation across the object ranges between 20-30%, consistent
with a non-thermal synchrotron origin. The morphology and polarisation are
broadly consistent with large-scale shocks driven by powerful starburst
outflows. However, the high degree of symmetry, the coherent double-ring
structure, and the absence of internal substructure are features commonly
associated with relic AGN lobes, making this scenario particularly compatible
with the observed characteristics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04218v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bright siren without electromagnetic counterpart by LISA-Taiji-TianQin

novel approach to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens,
enabling $H_0$ measurements by combining GW-derived distances with EM-derived

but remains challenging due to poor GW sky localization and uncertainties in
EMc models. To overcome these limitations, we exploit the ultra-high-precision
localization ($\Delta \Omega_s \sim 10^{-4} \, \text{deg}^2$) with a
space-based GW detector network (LISA-Taiji-TianQin), which permits unique host
identification solely from GW signals. We integrate five massive black hole

the redshift horizon for host galaxy identification and evaluate $H_0$
constraints. We find that (1) The network enhances localization by several
orders of magnitude compared to single detectors; (2) The identification
horizon reaches $z\sim 1.2$ for specific MBHBs in the most accurate
localization case; (3) The population model choice critically impacts the
outcomes: the most refined population models yield to independent EMc
identification rate of 0.6-1 $\text{yr}^{-1}$ with $H_0$ constraints $< 1\%$
fractional uncertainty, the less refined models lead to the rate
$<0.1\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $1-2\%$ uncertainty on $H_0$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04570v1" target="_blank"><h2>Re-assessing the stellar population scaling relations of the galaxies in

Synthesis (SPS) models, aperture-corrections, and statistical weights to
account for selection biases. In a Bayesian framework, we estimate stellar
masses, mean ages, and metallicities by comparing spectral indices and
photometry with composite SPS models. We adopt updated prescriptions for Star
Formation Histories (SFH) and Chemical Enrichment Histories (CEH), while also
testing different models and priors. We measure light-weighted ages for 354,977
galaxies (SNR>10) and metallicities for 89,852 galaxies (SNR>20), analyzing
their dependence on stellar mass. Key findings include: i) A revised bimodal
mass-age distribution, with a young sequence at low mass and an old sequence at
high mass, partly overlapping in mass and transitioning at 10^10.8 solar
masses. ii) A Mass-Metallicity Relation (MZR) shifted upwards by 0.2 dex
relative to previous works. Aperture corrections lower masses, ages, and
metallicities in a mass-dependent way, enhancing the young sequence and
steepening the MZR. iii) Using Halpha-based SFRs, we found that while
star-forming/young and quiescent/old correspondences generally hold, exceptions
exist for many galaxies. Quiescent galaxies show a flatter, less scattered MZR
than star-forming ones, with convergence at high mass. iv) SPS assumptions
strongly affect our results, particularly SFHs and CEHs. These revised

Systematic uncertainties of 0.15 dex may arise from aperture biases and SPS

need models that can predict the matter power spectrum for at least
$k\,\lesssim\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with percent-level precision. The main
challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly
redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we
present an improved version of the "resummation" model, which maps observed
halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\,
\mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of
baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free
parameters. We apply this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations,
obtaining a typical precision of $\lesssim 1\%$ for
$k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the
spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When
only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim
2\%$ precision. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the
model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ precise suppression signals for
all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the
model to redshifts $z>0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent
and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped
to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions,
to $\lesssim 1\%$ precision. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used
to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon
fractions with percent-level precision, without any assumptions on the strength
of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made
publicly available.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04662v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving Emission from Small Dust Grains in the Blue Compact Dwarf II

(NIRSpec) and Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral-field spectroscopy of the
nearby blue compact dwarf II Zw 40, which has a low metallicity of 25% of
solar. Leveraging the high spatial/spectral resolution and wavelength coverage
of JWST/NIRSpec, we present robust detections of the 3.3 um polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) emission on 20 pc scales. The strength of the Pf delta
emission relative to the 3.3 PAH feature is significantly stronger than typical
higher metallicity star-forming galaxies. We find that 3.3 um PAH emission is
concentrated near the northern super star cluster and is co-spatial with CO
gas. A strong correlation exists between the 3.3/11.3 PAH ratio and radiation
hardness probed by NeIII/NeII, providing evidence of photodestruction of PAH
molecules in intense radiation environments. Our analysis shows that while the
overall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies,
the contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher.
We propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two
competing mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and
inhibited growth. Additionally, the high radiation field intensity in II Zw 40
suggests that multi-photon heating of PAHs may be an important effect. As one
of the first spatially resolved studies of aromatic emission in a

for future observations of the 3.3 um PAH feature in low-metallicity galaxies

globular clusters (GCs) have long been hypothesized to be the building blocks
of young galaxies. Within the Milky Way, our best tracers of the contribution
of GCs to the proto-Galaxy are stars with such anomalous overabundance in
nitrogen and depletion in oxygen ("high-[N/O] stars") that they can be
identified as having originated in a cluster long after they have escaped. We
identify associations between these high-[N/O] field stars and GCs using
integrals of motion and metallicities and compare to chemically typical halo
stars to quantify any excess association, enabling a population-level
exploration of the formation sites of the nitrogen-enhanced stars in the field.
Relative to the halo as a whole, high-[N/O] stars show stronger associations
with the most initially massive, inner Galaxy GCs, suggesting that many
nitrogen-rich stars formed in these environments. However, when compared to a
sample matched in orbital energy, the excess largely disappears: high-[N/O]
stars are, on average, no more associated with surviving GCs than
energy-matched halo stars, despite their [N/O] abundances indicating GC
origins, consistent with a scenario in which a substantial fraction of
low-energy inner-halo stars originate in GCs, so an energy-matched control
dilutes any differential excess. We argue that associations between high-[N/O]
stars and their parent GCs are further weakened because dynamical friction and
the Galactic bar have altered integrals of motion, limiting the reliability of
precise present-day associations and, especially, individual star-to-cluster
tagging.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05174v1" target="_blank"><h2>A milliarcsecond localization associates FRB 20190417A with a compact,

migration of hydrogen atoms on a rough surface of carbon dust grain. The
migration of physisorbed atoms by means of thermal diffusion and quantum
tunnelling through barriers between the surface potential minima is considered.
The model is applied to simulations of molecular hydrogen formation in a cold
interstellar medium for a temperature range 5-35 K. Eley-Rideal and
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms for the formation of the H$_2$ molecule were
taken into account. We found that the surface potential energy minima that hold
the accreted hydrogen atoms (binding energy) has wide dispersion of its values.
The minimum energy is three times smaller than the maximum energy for the
uneven surface of the model grain. The large dispersion of the binding energies
results in an extended range of temperatures where H$_2$ formation is
efficient: 5-25 K. The dispersion of binding energies also reduces efficiency
of diffusion due to tunnelling in comparison to that assumed in kinetic
equation codes in which constant values of binding energies are employed. Thus,
thermal hopping is the main source for the mobility of the hydrogen atoms in
the presented off-lattice model. Finally, the model naturally provides the mean
values for the ratio of binding-to-desorption energy. This ratio demonstrates
weak dependence on temperature and is in the range of 0.5-0.6.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04405v1" target="_blank"><h2>Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$α$ Forest Spectra for

probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore
sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These
include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal
history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale
fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly
sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate
synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these
effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for
generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D
analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted
flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux
power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation
parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq
z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$
s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to
sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we
discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of
astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects.
Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and
enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D

large angular scales. This neglects real variations on small angular and
distance scales from discrete components of the ISM. We use $V$ band
polarimetry, public dust maps, and Gaia DR3 distances of 25 stars along a 50'
radius sight line towards the O9.5IV star $\zeta$ Ophiuchi ($d \approx $ 182
pc) to examine both dust and magnetic structures over the range $d = $ 36--1176
pc and angular scales of $< 1$\degr. Polarization and reddening data indicate
two discrete dust populations having different magnetic field orientations
along the sight line, one at $d \simeq$ 86--127 pc and another at $d\simeq$
252--287 pc. After removal of the foreground, the more distant component
exhibits alignment in polarization angle with 12 $\mu$m PAH striations seen in
the field. This more distant dust population exhibits evidence of extreme
starlight polarization efficiency with an average of 14.1% mag$^{-1}$, greater
than the canonical Serkowski limit of 9% mag$^{-1}$. The spatial coincidence
with the PAH striations indicates the PAH-emitting grains and those responsible
for the high polarization efficiency may be components of the same dust
population. We find no evidence that $\zeta$ Oph's radiative influence affects
the polarizing or reddening properties of the surrounding dust. Our study
demonstrates that accurate distance-based foreground subtraction is vital to
properly understanding superimposed dust and the magnetic field components in
the ISM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04678v1" target="_blank"><h2>PRIMA survey of the Virgo cluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jacopo Fritz, Maarten Baes, Diego Alejandro Vasquez Torres, Karla Alejandra Cutiva Alvarez, Angelos Nersesian, Viviana Casasola, Eric F.

were the lack of data, or its limited availability, in the 20 to 80 micron

discovery of new classes of X-ray transients associated with Type Ic-Broad Line
supernovae. These events commonly exhibit bright early-time optical
counterparts, and sudden afterglow rebrightening within the first week -
features that existing models fail to explain. In particular, structured jet
and cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and
multi-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to
its inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the
multi-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The
resulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a "top-hat"
geometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular
structure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency
that can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and
$\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual
wobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when
the emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight.
The radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of
stripped-envelope supernovae. It comprises a mildly relativistic cocoon
($0.3\lesssim\beta\Gamma\lesssim3$) that may power an early ($\sim1\,{\rm
day}$) rapidly decaying emission, followed by slower, black hole accretion
disk-driven outflows ($\beta\lesssim0.3$), which dominate the slowly evolving
optical emission at $t\gtrsim1\,{\rm day}$. This novel multi-component outflow
structure provides a unified explanation for the multiband light curves
observed in Einstein Probe transients and is likely a common feature of Type
Ic-Broad Line supernovae more broadly.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04557v1" target="_blank"><h2>The orbital anisotropy profile of the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus accretion

important stellar populations in the Milky Way halo. Recent simulation-based
work has suggested that the anisotropy profiles of remnants like GS/E decline
towards the center and may be well-fit by an Osipkov-Merritt-type distribution
function (DF). We study the anisotropy profile of GS/E using a
chemically-selected sample of stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia. We find that the
anisotropy profile of GS/E is high and constant with $\beta \sim 0.9$ beyond 8
kpc, dropping to $\beta \sim 0.4$ at 2 kpc. We fit a two-component
Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy profile to the GS/E data, finding that a combination
of profiles with scale radii $r_{\mathrm{a}}=2$ kpc and 547 kpc, with a mixture
fraction $k_\mathrm{om} = 0.88$ provide a better fit to the data than a
constant anisotropy profile. Using this new DF, we re-assess the density
profile and mass of the GS/E remnant from a previous work that assumed a
contant-anisotropy DF, finding an increase in the derived mass from $1.5\times
10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to $2.29 ^{+0.95}_{-0.63}\times
10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In general, the combination Osipkov-Merritt DF more
satisfactorily matches the kinematics of the GS/E remnant than the constant
anisotropy DF, and in the future will form a more reliable basis for modelling
the remnant. Additionally, these new constraints on the kinematics of GS/E near
the Galactic center are an important measurement for any future theoretical or
simulation-based investigation into its nature and origin.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04142v1" target="_blank"><h2>Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation

Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased
density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated
with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias
expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies
statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes
the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions
for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an
efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT},
enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set
of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation
functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power
spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and
cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass
combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters
reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq
0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k
\simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also
match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq
15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation
$b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against
$N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically
consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to
redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction. The numerical

to detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He
ii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere
code PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases
reflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN
stars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He
ii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar
signatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H <
8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess
of nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population
synthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this
observed WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04237v1" target="_blank"><h2>Axion-Photon Conversion In Magnetized Universe: Impact On The Global

Accepted for publication in IJMPD</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), IGM (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The reported anomalous global 21-cm signal $(T_{21})$ from the cosmic dawn
era by Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionisation Signature (EDGES)
could hint towards new physics beyond the standard model. The resonant
conversion of the axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in the presence of
primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) could be a viable solution. However, the
strength of the PMFs can change over the time as they can decay by ambipolar
diffusion and turbulent decay. Consequently, PMFs can dissipate their energy
into the intergalactic medium (IGM), which can alter the global 21-cm signal.
We simultaneously consider both magnetic heating of IGM and resonant conversion
of ALPs to derive physically motivated upper bounds on the coupling strength
$(g_{a\gamma})$ and magnetic field strength $(B_n)$. Our findings report that,
for $B_n= 0.1\,\rm nG$, $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim (3.6\times 10^{-4}-3\times
10^{-3})$ is required to recover standard $T_{21}=-156\,\rm mK$, while a deeper
absorption of $-500$ mK pushes the upper bound to $g_{a\gamma}B_n\lesssim
(6.5\times 10^{-4}-5.7\times 10^{-3})$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04348v1" target="_blank"><h2>GWTC-4.0: Constraints on the Cosmic Expansion Rate and Modified

fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient
Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the
population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity
distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW
source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact
object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential
host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between
source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields
constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized
deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically
those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity
distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution
and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run
(O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 =
76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value
is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and
includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its
electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation
in terms of the magnitude parameter $\Xi_0$, we estimate $\Xi_0 =
1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior
of general relativity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04857v1" target="_blank"><h2>Direct measurement of ISM proper motion with image registration</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid, and the Nancy Grace
Roman Space Telescope, will place unprecedented constraints on cosmology using
weak gravitational lensing. To fully exploit their statistical power, shear
measurement methods must achieve sub-percent accuracy while mitigating
systematic biases from noise, the point-spread function (PSF), blending, and
shear-dependent detection. The analytical calibration framework
(\texttt{AnaCal}) has demonstrated such accuracy but requires adding noise to
images, reducing their effective depth. We introduce Deep-Field Analytical
Calibration (\textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal}), an extension of
\texttt{AnaCal} that leverages deep-field images to compute shear responses
while preserving wide-field statistical power. We validate the method on
isolated and blended galaxy simulations with LSST-like seeing and noise,
showing it meets the stringent requirement of multiplicative bias $|m| <
3\times10^{-3}$ at 99.7% confidence. Relative to standard \texttt{AnaCal} on
wide-field images, this method improves effective galaxy number density from
$17$ to $30$ arcmin$^{-2}$ for simulated 10-year LSST data. Assuming deep
fields with $10\times$ the exposure of wide fields, we find the pixel noise
variance in shear estimation is reduced by $30%$ and the overall shear
uncertainty by $\sim 25%$. Finally, we assess sample variance impacts using the
LSST Deep Drilling Fields strategy, finding an equivalent calibration
uncertainty of $\lesssim 0.3%$. These results establish
\textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal} as a promising approach for shear
calibration in upcoming weak lensing surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04723v1" target="_blank"><h2>Attributing the supernova remnant RCW 89 to the jittering jets explosion

identify a point-symmetric morphology composed of two main symmetry axes. I
attribute this morphology to a jet-driven explosion in the framework of the
jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). To reach this conclusion, I argue
that the MSH 15-52 nebula associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the X-ray
hand-like-shaped nebula, and RCW 89 are two separate core-collapse supernova
(CCSN) remnants that interact with each other. Namely, the nebula SNR
G320.4-1.2 contains two CCSN remnants. In essence, I utilize the recent
successes of the JJEM to account for the morphologies of point-symmetric CCSN
remnants, thereby explaining the morphology of RCW 89 and identifying it as a
separate CCSN remnant. I suggest a process by which somewhat more energetic
pairs of jets in the JJEM have a positive feedback on the accreted gas onto the
newly born neutron star, thereby prolonging the life of the jets and explaining
the occurrence of two or three energetic pairs of jets in some CCSNe. This
study adds RCW 89 to the growing list of point-symmetric CCSN remnants. The
JJEM naturally explains these morphologies as shaped by misaligned pairs of
jets that exploded these CCSNe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04572v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectropolarimetry of synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons

Kong</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, published on MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> For synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons having a power-law
energy distribution with a power-law index $p$ in an optically thin medium with
a locally uniform magnetic field, it is generally adopted that the spectral
index $\alpha = (p-1)/2$ and the degree of linear polarisation $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}
= (p +1)/(p+7/3)$, and hence that $\Pi_{\rm L,pl} = (\alpha +1)/(\alpha+5/3)$.
These ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations are derived assuming that the
electrons have an isotropic momentum distribution and a power-law energy
distribution, and they have been used, almost universally, in the
interpretation of polarimetry observations. In this study, we assess the
validity of the ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations in different
scenarios, such as anisotropic electron momenta and non-power-law distributions
of electron energy. We calculate the synchrotron radiation and polarisation
spectra for power-law, kappa and log-parabola electron-energy distributions,
with isotropic and two anisotropic (beamed and loss cone) electron-momentum
distributions. Our calculations show that when the electron momenta are
isotropic, the usual ($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations are generally
applicable. However, if the electrons are anisotropic, the usual ($\alpha$,
$\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations could break down. Applying the usual
($\alpha$, $\Pi_{\rm L,pl}$; $p$) relations indiscriminately without caution on
anisotropy in the electron momentum distribution, would lead to incorrect
interpretations of polarimetry data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04706v1" target="_blank"><h2>Do both black holes spin in merging binaries? Evidence from GWTC-4 and
  astrophysical implications</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Christian Adamcewicz, Nir Guttman, Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Angular momentum transport in high-mass stars is commonly modeled by
extrapolating the behavior of better-observed low-mass stars. According to the
conventional picture, the cores of most black hole progenitors lose almost all
of their angular momentum when their outer layers are ejected before core
collapse. Accordingly, most black holes are expected to be born with
dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$, even if some black holes
are born with non-negligible spin due to tidal interactions in a progenitor
binary. One might therefore expect to find a large fraction of $\chi \lesssim
0.01$ black holes in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. We find that the
conventional picture of angular momentum transport is in tension with data from
LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog. We find no
support for a sub-population of BBH systems with $\chi \lesssim 0.01$. Neither
do we find support for a sub-population with only one spinning black hole as
expected for tidal spin-up scenarios. Instead, we find evidence for two
subpopulations in which both black holes have non-negligible spin.
Approximately 84% of BBH systems contain two black holes with modest spins
$\chi \approx 0.1$ and approximately 16% contain two black holes with large
spins $\chi \approx 0.8$. These estimates come from our best-fit model, which
is favored with natural log Bayes factors $\ln B \gtrsim 3$ over models that
require a sub-population of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes, and models that
do not contain multiple spin sub-populations. These results are difficult to
reconcile with our current understanding of angular momentum transport.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05240v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing Magnetic Field Configurations in Spider Pulsar PSR J1723-2837

pulsar binary, \src, with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).
Redbacks are compact binaries in which a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar
interacts with a non-degenerate companion via an intrabinary shock, forming
ideal laboratories for probing pulsar winds and relativistic shock physics,
where ordered magnetic fields and particle acceleration shape the observed
radiation. We conduct a spectro-polarimetric analysis combining IXPE data with
archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift observations. We explore two
limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk
flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the {\tt 3DPol}
radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization
angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes
alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for
phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to
determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the
polarization degree uncertainty. This technique shows a hint the binary may be
rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant
detection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD<51% at 99% confidence
level. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by
the perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin.
Simulations show that doubling the current exposure would make the parallel
configuration detectable. The new PA rotation technique is also applicable to
IXPE data of many sources whose intrinsic PA variation is apriori not known but
is strictly periodic.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04574v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can "premature collapse" form black holes in the upper and lower mass
  gaps?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including
the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor
black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is
generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass
gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt
the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum
allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in
supernova explosions. Here we explore a "premature collapse" scenario in which
upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late
stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse
is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A
similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass
gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely
result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining
the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on
several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least
in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the
upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the
lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.</p></br></body>
