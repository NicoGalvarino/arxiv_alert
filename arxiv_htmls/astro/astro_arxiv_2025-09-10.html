circumgalactic medium (CGM) that can act as an additional feedback channel
beyond thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN. They influence galaxy
evolution by altering gas properties, regulating star formation, and shaping
galactic outflows. We investigate these effects using a suite of cosmological
zoom-in simulations, which incorporate CR transport and feedback on top of the
Auriga galaxy formation model. Our simulations span a wide range of halo
masses, from dwarf galaxies to small groups ($M_{200\mathrm{c}}= 10^{10} -
10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), allowing us to assess the mass-dependent impact of
CRs in a cosmological setting. We find that CRs have the strongest impact in
lower-mass galaxies ($M_{200\mathrm{c}} < 10^{12}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), where
they suppress star formation rates by up to 50\%, reduce gas and stellar
half-light radii, and drive outflows that reach higher velocities at the virial
radius compared to simulations without CRs. These CR-enhanced outflows also
transport more metals and magnetic fields into the CGM, leading to higher CGM
metallicities, stronger magnetisation, and lower CGM temperatures. In more
massive galaxies, CRs do not significantly affect star formation or outflow
properties, likely because thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN
dominate in this regime. However, CRs still influence galaxy morphology across
all halo masses by reducing the gas half-mass radius and stellar half-light
radius. Finally, variations in CR transport properties, such as different
diffusion coefficients or the exclusion of Alfv\'en cooling, significantly
affect star formation, CGM properties, and outflows in lower-mass galaxies.
This sensitivity makes these galaxies key environments for testing CR transport
models and refining our understanding of their role in galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07960v1" target="_blank"><h2>The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and star formation

star formation rates (SFRs) across cosmic time in the COLIBRE simulations of
galaxy formation. COLIBRE includes a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative
cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and employs
prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the $z=0$
observed GSMF and stellar mass - size relation. We present the evolution of the
GSMF from simulations at three resolutions: $m_{\rm gas}\approx m_{\rm dm}\sim
10^7$, $10^6$, and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, in cosmological volumes of up to
$400^3$, $200^3$, and $50^3$ cMpc$^3$, respectively. We demonstrate that
COLIBRE is consistent with the observed GSMF over the full redshift range for
which there are observations to compare with ($0<z<12$), with maximum
systematic deviations of $\approx 0.3$ dex reached at $2<z<4$. We also examine
the evolution of the star-forming main sequence, cosmic SFR density, stellar
mass density, and galaxy quenched fraction, making predictions for both the
fiducial COLIBRE model with thermally-driven AGN feedback and its variant with
hybrid (thermal + kinetic jet) AGN feedback, and finding good agreement with
observations. Notably, we show that COLIBRE matches the number density of
massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts reported by JWST, while predicting
a stellar-to-halo mass relation that evolves little with redshift. We conclude
that neither a redshift-dependent star formation efficiency, nor a variable
stellar initial mass function, nor a deviation from $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ is
necessary to reproduce the high-redshift JWST stellar masses and SFRs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07104v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic Rays on Galaxy Scales: Progress and Pitfalls for CR-MHD Dynamical

influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy
formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of
CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their
fundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso
(~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic,
Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls
and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling,
including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment
formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or
shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM)
observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing
only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR
transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from
self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We
emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived
CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons;
new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent
scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to
show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present
phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by
highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD
simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07611v1" target="_blank"><h2>Balmer Absorption in Iron Low-Ionization Broad Absorption Line Quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Karen M.

spectra, Balmer absorption lines are among the rarest. We present analysis of
Balmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars
(FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width,
and apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar
spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into
account, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated
correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this
sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds
characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b),
objects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al.
2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density
with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and
Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in
the lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with
{\alpha}oi, the F{\lambda} point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns.
This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among
low-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have
been recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of
high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities
between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of
steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission,
and X-ray weakness.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07453v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cross-correlations between the CLAMATO Lyman-alpha forest and galaxies

Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography
Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic
redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO,
zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured
cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as
observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived
redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected
from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR
emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of
`fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our
foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated
stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For
sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) =
[9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$,
respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck
$N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_* /
M_\odot) \approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass
end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with
predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based
observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07808v1" target="_blank"><h2>A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system

dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as
alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles
inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction
of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the
strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM
($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide
significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM
model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed
density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx
0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm
M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo
mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These
findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in
$\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07097v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining Baryon Fractions in Galaxy Groups and Clusters with the

dispersion measures (DMs) measure electron density independent of temperature
and scale linearly with gas density. This makes them particularly well suited
to studying the intragroup medium (IGrM), where traditional probes such as
X-ray emission and the SZ effect are weak. Evidence suggests that the baryon
content of group mass halos ($M_{500}\sim10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) is
strongly affected by galactic feedback, creating deviations from cluster
scaling relations. Three FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB Outrigger sample come
from host galaxies found within or behind galaxy clusters and groups. Using
integrated halo density models, we estimate the DM contribution of each
ICM/IGrM, accounting for uncertainties in halo mass and the distance to the
host galaxy relative to the cluster center. For the more massive halos,
predicted cluster DMs agree with the extragalactic DM budget. One burst, FRB
20230703A, intersects three groups yet has a low extragalactic DM. By comparing
model predictions with the measured DM, we constrain the baryon fraction
$f_g(R)$ in these halos. Comparing with published $M-f_g$ relations, we find
consistency with recent eROSITA results at $R_{500}$, mild tension at
$R_{200}$, and strong tensions with earlier X-ray-based relations. As CHIME/FRB
Outriggers build a large catalog of localized FRBs, many additional sightlines
through groups and clusters will be obtained. These will enable systematic
tests of intragroup and intracluster gas properties and sharpen constraints on
the distribution of baryons in massive halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07777v1" target="_blank"><h2>A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components

mass and the baryonic components of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063. The main
focus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this
second paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that
incorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic
components. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the
dark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster
and galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50"$ on
the multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \& ICL, as well
as the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately
reproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\mathrm{km/s}$
scatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This
method yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among
almost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\sigma$ agreement between
the inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale
cosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is
consistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the
first multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark
matter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its
results, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of
each mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations such as illustrisTNG.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07064v1" target="_blank"><h2>GA-NIFS: an extended [OIII] halo around the sub-Eddington quasar

window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral
field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928
obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO
programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\sim100$) and the
high-resolution grating ($R\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the
quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution
data reveal the presence of [\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\sim$7 kpc scales, well
above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past
outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more
energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total
ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$
where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on
the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate
range (85--545 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow
could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an
accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \textit{JWST} data, we manage
to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\rm
\log(M_{BH}/(M_{\odot}))=9.2\pm 0.2$ and $\rm \log(L_{bol}/(erg \,

this first paper, we focus on recovering the mass constraint datasets required
for the modelling approach introduced in the second paper. Specifically, we
measure the light distribution, stellar mass, and kinematics of the cluster
members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the intra-cluster light (ICL)
in Abell S1063. To that end, we developed a new method to extract the light
profiles of the cluster members, BCG, and ICL, while accounting for
contamination from nearby foreground and background galaxies in \textsc{Hubble
Space Telescope} (HST) imaging. We obtained light profiles for $289$ cluster
members using a dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) model based on the HST
F160W filter, while the BCG \& ICL is modelled as a single component using a
multi-Gaussian expansion. To estimate stellar masses and velocity dispersions,
we rely on multi-band HST photometry and \textsc{VLT/MUSE} integral field
spectroscopy, respectively. Stellar masses are derived using three different
spectral energy distribution (SED) models. We measure the line-of-sight
velocity dispersions of the cluster members at their half-light radii, as
determined from their light profiles, while for the BCG \& ICL components, we
use elliptical annular apertures. Thanks to these measurements, we will be able
to constrain the cluster stellar mass content, which is detailed in the second

Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising
mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m,
that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds
regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or
AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry
that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region
emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent
Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests
that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$>$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration
is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm
