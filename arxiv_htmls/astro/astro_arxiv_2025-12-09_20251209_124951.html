This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span $z_d = 0.39 - 1.1$ and $z_s = 1.4 - 3.3$. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling -- all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference -- with explicit convergence validation using both $\widehat{R}$ and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy $\widehat{R} < 1.1$ and ${\rm ESS} \gtrsim 10,000$, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07793v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hot, Photoionized X-ray Gas in Two Luminous Type 2 Quasars: Chandra-HST Evidence for a Wind-Driven Sequence</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anna Trindade Falcão, S.

Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths (FWHM~1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-rays are more centrally concentrated and only weakly correlated with the largely rotational [O III] kinematics. Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars. The inferred hot-gas reservoirs are substantial, M$_{\rm x-ray}$ ~ 4.5x10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ (FIRST J120041) and M$_{\rm x-ray}$ ~ 1.8x10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ (2MASX J130038), exceeding the outflowing [O III] masses (volume-normalized) by factors of ~4 and ~16, respectively. In 2MASX J130038, we also identify a tentative blueshifted Fe XXVI Ly$α$ line at E$_{\rm rest}$ = 7.14 $\pm$ 0.06 keV (v~7600 km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a nascent hot wind confined to the inner few hundred parsecs. Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by the progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce through the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to large-scale, energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07781v1" target="_blank"><h2>Microquasar remnants as hidden PeVatrons</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Leandro Abaroa, Gustavo E.

Cosmic rays injected during the active phase of a microquasar may remain confined within its cocoon and subsequently interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing bright gamma-ray emission through $pp$ collisions. Remnants of former super-Eddington systems can act as dark PeVatrons, releasing particles up to $\sim$10 PeV that illuminate surrounding clouds producing gamma rays reaching hundreds of TeV. This scenario provides a natural explanation for several unidentified Galactic LHAASO sources.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07780v1" target="_blank"><h2>The heartbeat of stellar halos: Insights from the stellar halo mass-metallicity relation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jenny Gonzalez-Jara, Patricia B.

We used central galaxies with log10(Mgal/Msun)=[9,11] from CIELO simulations. We identified stellar halos, from z=3.5 to z=0, using the AM-E method, focusing on the region between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We presented halo cardiograms, a novel approach to studying the assembly history of stellar halos. Using them, we defined a stability time (tst) as the first time that the median halo metallicity does not change more than \pm 0.1 dex with respect to its value at z=0. CIELO stellar halos reproduce the present-day observed MZhR. At z=3.5, stellar halos already define an MZhR whose slope is similar to the slope at z=0. For a fixed stellar halo mass, the metallicity increases ~0.21 dex from z=3.5 to z=0, reflecting the progressive chemical enrichment provided by the accretion of satellites with diverse masses and different levels of enrichment. When the first stellar halo main contributor (SHMC1) provides a mass fraction at least 20% higher than the remaining contributors, the stellar halo metallicity is set once SHMC1 is fully disrupted (tmerger). This yields a clear correlation between tst and tmerger, with a scatter of 2.2 Gyr driven by the relative importance of the second and third main contributing satellites. We provide two observational tracers for tst: t90 and a stability time from the age-metallicity relation. Our results suggest that estimating tst could serve as a proxy for dating the moment at which the stellar halo reaches the present-day MZhR, as well as for dating the last major merger that builds them. Combined with an estimation of the merger time of the main contributing satellite, it can provide insights into the relative importance of the second and third contributing satellites.

Dereli-Bégué, A. Pe'er, D. Bégué, F. Ryde, A. Gowri<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a "plateau" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a "plateau" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07719v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-Wavelength Afterglows as Diagnostic Probes of Dense Circumburst Medium in GRBs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiao-Hong Zhao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07637v1" target="_blank"><h2>The shape-velocity alignment of satellites forged by tidal locking and dynamical friction</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hao Yang, Wenting Wang, Ting S.

We find that radial alignment is substantially stronger than orbital alignment, with both signals being consistently stronger for subhalos than for satellites. Interestingly, inward- and outward-moving satellites/subhalos show contrasting orbital alignment behaviors, which can be understood in terms of their radial alignment, orbit decay due to dynamical friction and the effect of tidal stripping. The orbital alignment is stronger in more massive halos. In the end, we explore the orbital alignment measured by a mock observer, and find that the alignment reported by Pace et al. (2022) for MW satellites is due to projection effects, as the major axes of satellites lie within their orbital planes, approximately coplanar with the observer.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07604v1" target="_blank"><h2>Diverse stages of star formation in the IRAS 18162-2048 region.

Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \mathrm{μm}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$γ$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H$_2$ ro-vibrational populations for $T_\mathrm{gas}=600$ K and $n_\mathrm{H}=7.9\times10^3 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} observations targeting the H$_2$ pure rotational lines ($3-28 \mathrm{μm}$) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07565v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interstellar Medium in Extremely High Star-Formation Regions: A Prospect of Observations on the Millimetron</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> E.

In ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, in which the star-formation rate reaches thousands of solar masses per year, the gas and dust are considerably affected by the ionizing radiation, cosmic rays and shock waves, that can be about a factor of 100--1000 larger than typical values in quiet star-forming galaxies. In these conditions, the emissivity of the gas and dust changes: in dense gas, high ionic and molecular transitions become excited, while dust grains are heated to high temperatures. In this paper, we analyze the possibilities for studying the interstellar medium in extreme conditions of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies at redshifts of $\sim 0-3$, utilizing the atomic and molecular lines, and dust continuum in far infrared range of $100-500μ$m.

Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star formation, named the Clump, and located at the interface between the SNR W44 and the infrared dark cloud G034.77-00.55. We test whether the Clump has chemical properties consistent with those observed in star forming regions unaffected by SNRs. We use high-sensitivity, broad spectral surveys at 3 and 7 mm obtained with the 30m antenna at IIRAM and the 40 m YEBES antenna, to identify D-bearing species and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the Clump. For all species, we estimate molecular abundances and compare them with those observed across star forming regions at different evolutionary stages and masses, as well as comets. We detect multiple deuterated molecules (DCO+, DNC, DCN, CH2DOH) and COMs (CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3CCH, CH3CN, CH3SH) with excitation temperatures of 5-13 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars. The resulting chemical budget may be preserved along the formation process of a planetary system, being finally incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07290v1" target="_blank"><h2>Diagnosing Interstellar Magnetic Turbulence with TeV Pulsar Halos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chao-Ming Li, Ruo-Yu Liu, Huirong Yan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Interstellar magnetic field is essential in various astrophysical phenomena and processes.

The emitted particles from BHs interact with the thermal background and thermalize, leading to a modification in the Hawking radiation spectrum. By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries. These corrections depend on the interplay between the BH temperature and the ambient bath temperature. We apply this formalism in the early universe reheating background scenario arising after inflation and demonstrate that the thermal correction to Hawking spectrum enhances the evaporation rate of primordial black holes (PBHs). As a result, the lifetime of PBH shortens compared to the zero temperature vacuum and leads to interesting cosmological consequences.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07281v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Dark Energy and the Unresolved Hubble Tension: Multi-model Constraints from DESI 2025 and Other Probes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhuoming Zhang, Tengpeng Xu, Yun Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a Bayesian comparative analysis of five cosmological models: $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, $φ$CDM (with scalar-field dark energy), and an interacting dark energy scenario (the $ξ$ model), to investigate dark energy evolution and the Hubble tension.

First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$).

The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07236v1" target="_blank"><h2>Counting voids and filaments: Betti Curves as a Powerful Probe for Cosmology</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jiayi Li, Cheng Zhao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 15 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Topological analysis of galaxy distributions has gathered increasing attention in cosmology, as they are able to capture non-Gaussian features of large-scale structures (LSS) that are overlooked by conventional two-point clustering statistics. We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $σ_8$, and $Ω_{\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $σ_8$, and $w$.

However, dominant $B$-mode signals of both Galactic foreground contamination and gravitational lensing effects prevent direct measurements of the PGW $B$-mode signals. There are existing proposals which can effectively eliminate these two contaminants but issues remain for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency CMB polarization observations, such as spatially-varying spectral energy distribution (SED) of polarized foreground and cosmological $B$-mode signals due to primordial magnetic fields (PMFs). In this work, we investigate inference of PGW $B$-mode signals in the presence of both complexities. We employ a constrained moment internal linear combination (cMILC) method to remove polarization signals arising from spatially varying SEDs. Also, we employ a power-spectrum-based approach to extracting both the Galactic and cosmological $B$-mode components. Two methods have been validated by mock data and different consistency tests have been performed. We apply these two methods to end-to-end simulations for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency polarization observations and investigate the detectability of different $B$-mode signals in the presence of non-Gaussian polarized foregrounds under different scenarios. This study will be important for new physics studies with $B$-mode signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07223v1" target="_blank"><h2>FEASTS Compared with Simulations: Abnormally Irregular and Extended HI Morphologies at a Column Density of $10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ in TNG50 and Auriga</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xuchen Lin, Jing Wang, Guinevere Kauffmann, Volker Springel, Rüdiger Pakmor<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages of main text, 2 pages of appendices, 15 pages in total; 11 figures plus one atlas figure set as the ancillary PDF file<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> feedback (abstract), stellar feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> With new atomic-hydrogen (HI) observations of FAST Extended Atlas of Selected Targets Survey (FEASTS), we present the first statistical comparison of HI morphology between observations and cosmological simulations, focusing on low-column density ($10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) regions of Milky Way-like central galaxies. We select a 330-galaxy sample from IllustrisTNG50 (TNG50) matched to 33 FEASTS galaxies by stellar and HI masses, and mock observe them to the FAST resolution and depth at corresponding inclinations and distances for a fair comparison. In contrast to FEASTS, abnormally irregular and extended morphology is found in more than one-third of TNG50 galaxies, especially those massive and HI poor. Stellar feedback is the property that most significantly correlates with the HI morphological deviation from observations, although these deviations mostly occur at a high stellar or black-hole mass. These results indicate that in TNG50, stellar feedback significantly influences the HI morphology at $10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$, while active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback has not so direct a role as expected. With an additional sample from Auriga, we find that the magnetic field may help HI to be more regular in its morphology, while improving the mass resolution does not alleviate the discrepancy from observation. This study reveals the potential of constraining future simulations of galaxies by observing low-column density HI.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07214v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulation Study of Binary Mergers of Galaxy Clusters I: Properties of Merger Shocks and Radio Emission</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hyesung Kang, Dongsu Ryu, Jeongbhin Seo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate binary mergers of galaxy clusters and the resulting radio relics using three-dimensional simulations. The initial setup consists of two idealized, spherical subclusters with a mass ratio below three, each permeated by turbulent magnetic fields, and we follow their mergers with a high-order accurate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields--both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger--produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness. Our results highlight the coupled roles of merger dynamics, MHD turbulence, and CRe physics in shaping up the observed properties of radio relics in cluster outskirts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07140v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence of young magnetars in massive binary embedded in a supernova remnant as sources of active fast radio bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

A subclass of repeating FRBs show some common features, such as associated compact persistent radio sources (PRSs), high burst rates, and large host-galaxy dispersion measures (DMs). Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs. Our results support a unified population of active FRBs in dynamic magnetized environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07129v1" target="_blank"><h2>Statistics of the projected angles between the black-hole spin and the host-galaxy rotation axes from NewHorizon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sebastien Peirani, Yasushi Suto, Clotilde Laigle, Yen-Ting Lin, Yohan Dubois, Sukyoung K.

In this study, we use the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation NewHorizon, which self-consistently evolves BH mass and spin, to statistically examine the relationship between AGN jet orientation and host galaxy structure. Building upon our previous work, we extend the analysis of projected (2-d) alignment angles to facilitate more direct comparisons with recent observational studies. In our methodology, galaxy orientations are estimated using optical position angles derived from synthetic DESI-LS and Euclid images, while BH spin vectors serve as proxies for AGN jet directions. From a carefully selected sample of 100 BH-galaxy systems at low redshift, we generate a catalog of 5,000 mock optical images using a Monte Carlo approach that samples random viewing angles and redshifts. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for AGN jets to align with the orientation of their host galaxies, consistent with recent observations combining Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and optical imaging of nearby AGNs. Furthermore, we find a slightly stronger alignment when using kinematic position angles derived from synthetic MaNGA-like stellar velocity fields. These findings underscore the importance of combining morphological, kinematic, and polarimetric information to disentangle the complex interplay between black hole spin evolution, accretion mode, and the galactic environment in shaping the direction of relativistic jets.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07105v1" target="_blank"><h2>Universal relation involving fundamental modes in two-fluid dark matter admixed neutron stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hajime Sotani, Ankit Kumar<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We systematically investigate the fundamental oscillation frequencies of dark matter admixed neutron stars, focusing on models with self-interacting fermionic dark matter that couples to normal matter solely through gravity. The analysis is carried out within a two-fluid formalism under the relativistic Cowling approximation, where the perturbation equations follow from the linearized energy-momentum conservation laws of both components. We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07104v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Dark Energy in light of DESI BAO and Full-Shape Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Quan Zhou, Sibo Zheng<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, the DESI BAO data has reported a preference of dynamical dark energy (DDE) over the $Λ$CDM.Apart from the BAO data, the DDE model should be also sensitive to low-redshift measurements of matter power spectrum.In this study, we address this point by combining the DESI Y1 data about the matter power spectrum, extracted from the DESI Full-Shape data, with the DESI DR2 BAO data among others.After building the DESI Y1 likelihood,we carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, showing that the constraints on $w_0$ and $w_{a}$ with DESI Y1 data included are improved over those without it for three different datasets widely considered,especially in the case of DESY5 sample.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07066v1" target="_blank"><h2>Trends in gravitational wave emission in axisymmetric simulations of rotating core-collapse supernovae</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bailey Sykes, Bernhard Müller<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 16 figures, submitted to PRD<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-08<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The quantitative impact of strong rotation on the amplitudes and frequencies of the post-bounce gravitational wave (GW) signal from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still not fully understood. To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07050v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST reveals extended stellar disks for ALMA-bright dusty star-forming galaxies in the Spiderweb protocluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Y.

We identify 22 DSFGs detected by both ALMA and JWST, 10 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as protocluster members. This is the first systematic analysis of a statistical DSFG sample in $z\sim2$ protocluster environments using JWST/NIRCam data. Most of the DSFG members exhibit very red colors and reside in the dusty star-forming region of the rest-frame UVJ diagram, indicating strong dust obscuration. The Gini-M20 diagram suggests that most DSFGs in this protocluster are late-type disks, with a significant fraction displaying clumpy and disturbed rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, but few showing clear merger signatures. The DSFG members exhibit relatively large stellar disks and effective radii with a median stellar mass of log(M/Msun) = 10.8 +/- 0.3, placing them above coeval field DSFGs and typical protocluster galaxies in the size-mass relation at both rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These sizes are comparable to those of more evolved field DSFGs at z~1-2, indicating accelerated structural growth in dense environments. Moreover, these DSFG members show a decreasing trend in stellar size from shorter to longer wavelengths, with a moderately steep slope comparable to coeval field DSFGs. These results may support an inside-out growth scenario for protocluster evolution, in which massive galaxies near the center are more evolved and more strongly affected by AGN feedback and environmental effects, e.g., ram-pressure stripping. We propose that the cold gas accretion at the protocluster outskirts drives intense star formation and stellar disk growth in ALMA-detected DSFGs, which are expected to evolve into massive elliptical galaxies at later stages.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07020v1" target="_blank"><h2>Core-halo scaling relations in self-interacting scalar field dark matter</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jessica N.

Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07012v1" target="_blank"><h2>SS433 PeV neutron jet feeding the far TeV gamma beam</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Daniele Fargion, Pier Giorgio De Sanctis Lucentini, Sara Turriziani, Danila Sopin, Maxim Yu.

Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M_{\text {PBH}}< 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges. For a broad transition with $δ=10^{-2}$ we find that PBHs in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq10^{8}$-$10^{13}$ g are excluded at the level of $f_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{-8}$. In contrast, for a fast-transition case ($k=1$), the evaporation is suppressed so efficiently that no meaningful 21 cm constraint remains for $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{7}$ g.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06803v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-thermal Synchrotron Emission and Polarization Signatures during Black Hole Flux Eruptions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fan Zhou, Jiewei Huang, Yuehang Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Yehui Hou, Minyong Guo, Bin Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 15 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-07<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we investigate synchrotron emission and the observational signatures of anisotropic non-thermal electrons during magnetic-flux eruptions in a magnetically arrested disk, using 3D GRMHD simulations.

The results show that non-thermal emission can produce pronounced flux outbursts and localized brightening during eruptions, while the associated increase in optical depth can suppress the linear polarization fraction. Introducing pitch-angle anisotropy further reshapes the angular distribution of the intrinsic emissivity and modulates its contribution to various observable signatures.

In this work, we investigate whether incorporating high-redshift environmental factors improves the accuracy of matching high-redshift galaxies to their $z\sim0$ descendants, using data from the EAGLE and MAGNETICUM simulations. Using random forest regression, we evaluate the relative importance of a set of environmental metrics at $z\sim3$ in determining the stellar mass of descendant galaxies at $z\sim0$. We identify the spherical overdensity within 1 cMpc ($δ_{1,\mathrm{sp}}$) as the most important environmental predictor. Tracking galaxies at $z\sim3$ with similar initial stellar masses but different $δ_{1,\mathrm{sp}}$ values, we find that, across all mass bins in both simulations, high-density environments produce $z\sim0$ descendants with median stellar masses up to eight times higher than the descendants of galaxies in low-density environments. For galaxies with $M_{*}\lesssim10^{10}M_{\odot}$, the difference is attributable to more merger-induced mass growth in high-density environments, whereas for higher-mass galaxies, it results from a combination of enhanced in-situ star formation and greater external mass accretion. By assessing the importance of overdensity across multiple scales and redshifts, we find that at $z\gtrsim2$, environmental factors become as important as stellar mass in predicting the stellar mass of $z\sim0$ descendants. Compared to using stellar mass at $z\sim3$ alone, incorporating $δ_{1,\mathrm{sp}}$ reduces the scatter in the residuals between the predicted and actual stellar masses by approximately 20% in EAGLE and 35% in MAGNETICUM.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06622v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fast X-ray Variability from the Coronae of Supermassive Black Holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiurui Zhao, Luca Comisso, Stefano Marchesi, Marco Ajello, Elias Kammoun, Yue Shen, Qiaoya Wu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, accepted to ApJL<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-07<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), SDSS (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the first systematic study of short-timescale X-ray variability in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN), utilizing archival Chandra observations of approximately 3,000 broad-line AGN selected from the SDSS and DESI spectroscopic surveys. We identify 14 AGN exhibiting rapid (on timescales of tens of kiloseconds) X-ray flux variations by factors of two or more that are statistically significant ($p\le6\times10^{-4}$), indicative of fast coronal variability. By converting minimum variability timescales to light-crossing times, we place upper limits on the sizes of the variable coronal regions, finding typical scales of $\lesssim10^{-4}$~pc. The coronal variable region size upper limits of an AGN in our sample are found to be much smaller than the typical coronal sizes inferred from microlensing, suggesting that its corona is composed of localized, transient structures rather than smooth, homogeneous plasmas. Such efficient magnetic energy dissipation in compact volumes is consistent with expectations for magnetically dominated coronae and is supported by recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Future high-throughput X-ray observatories will enable the detection of even faster coronal variability, providing direct constraints on the physical mechanisms driving plasma energization and flux fluctuation near supermassive black holes.

This proximity allows us to resolve the kinematic impact of feedback on scales down to 5 kpc. Our spectral analysis reveals a high velocity dispersion of $σ_v$=262 (+45 / -38) km/s near the AGN, which steeply declines to ~60 km/s between 5 and 25 kpc in the northwest direction. The observed line-of-sight bulk velocity in all regions is broadly consistent with the central galaxy, M87, with a mild trend toward blueshifted motions at larger radii. Systematic uncertainties have been carefully assessed and do not affect the measurements. The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06584v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Cosmic Magnetism with Rotation Measure-Squared-Galaxy Cross-Correlations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zekai Zhang, Adam Lidz<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 36 pages, 12 figures, to be submitted to JCAP<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), ISM (title), AGN (title, abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a new approach for extracting information about cosmic magnetic fields using cross-correlations between extragalactic Faraday rotation measure (RM) catalogs and galaxy surveys. Specifically, we propose measuring the two-point cross-correlation between RM squared, ${\rm RM}^2$, towards background sources and the projected density field of foreground galaxies, $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$, as a function of transverse separation. This statistic is analogous to the ''projected fields'' estimator used for the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, $\langle {\rm kSZ}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$. Our estimator avoids contamination, and is also free from the noise bias that arises when correlating the absolute value of the RMs with galaxies. Moreover, by binning in foreground galaxy redshifts, $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ enables a tomographic reconstruction of the redshift evolution of large-scale cosmic magnetic fields. We model this statistic using the Illustris-TNG cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations and compare with approximate analytic predictions. We show that $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ can be related to a bispectrum involving two copies of the electron-density--weighted magnetic field strength and one of the galaxy overdensity. In Illustris-TNG, the effective field strength is primarily set by the magnetic field amplitudes within the inner regions of galaxy-hosting dark matter halos. It increases towards low redshift, driven by dynamo amplification and magnetized outflows. Our forecasts suggest that $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ is detectable at high significance with current galaxy surveys and future RM catalogs from the SKA, offering a tomographic probe of large-scale magnetic fields across cosmic time.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06568v1" target="_blank"><h2>Angular BAO Forecasts for the IBIS Medium-Band Survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Richard M.

While spectroscopic data from these surveys constrain the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature with high precision, the imaging surveys used for target selection can provide useful information on the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. In this work we explore the feasibility of angular BAO measurements for the Intermediate-Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) using recent constraints on clustering from a pilot survey spanning $2.2<z<3.5$. Through Fisher forecasts, we find that a 5000 deg$^2$ survey of LAEs with realistic bias, a tracer density of $2\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^3$ and interloper fraction $f_{\rm int}=10\%$ can constrain the BAO dilation parameter $α$ at $z_{\rm eff}=2.8$ with a precision of 2.6\%, with dependence on the sample properties that is consistent with shot noise-dominated measurements. We then explore medium-band survey specifications for the planned Stage-V Spectroscopic Instrument (Spec-S5) and beyond, demonstrating the potential for precise high-redshift BAO measurements. Our forecasts motivate early measurements of BAO from these imaging surveys, which may inform later spectroscopic analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06469v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unified models revisited I: modelling the effect of source geometry on radio galaxy/quasar unification</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Siddhant Pinjarkar, Martin J.

A key prediction of this model is that the quasars are seen at smaller angles to the line of sight and so should be more affected by projection, and hence apparently physically smaller, than corresponding radio galaxies, but this has not always been found in earlier studies. We argue that the interpretation of observations requires a less simplistic model for the effects of projection, which takes into account radio sources' finite width and their intrinsic axial ratio distribution. Using this cylindrical configuration as a basis for the simulation of radio galaxies and quasars, we simulate the distribution of the linear size ratio of quasars to radio galaxies for different sample sizes and critical angles. Our simulations that predict the ratio of observed lengths in the presence of a distribution of intrinsic physical sizes and axial ratios that we derive from observation. We conclude that to test the unified scheme, samples should be completely optically identified, sizes should be measurable for all targets, and the sample size should be greater than $\sim 800$ sources. Such large samples with uniform optical identification and accurate size measurements have not been available in previous work, but should become available from wide-area sky surveys in the near future.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06454v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the Distance Duality Relation with Cosmological Observations at high Redshift using Artificial Neural Network</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yukang Xie, Yang Liu, Puxun Wu, Xiangyun Fu, Nan Liang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), high redshift (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The cosmic Distance Duality Relation (DDR) is a fundamental prediction of metric gravity under photon number conservation.

The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework. Some GRB X-ray afterglows that exhibit slight and early rebrightenings may result from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06279v1" target="_blank"><h2>Apparent Phantom Crossing in Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shin'ichi Nojiri, Sergei D.

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06271v1" target="_blank"><h2>CLASSY XIV: The Nitrogen Exception -- Multi-Phase Enrichment and Feedback in High-$z$ Analogs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bethan L.

Using co-spatial UV absorption and optical emission-line spectroscopy, we compare abundances of N, O, S, and Fe in the low-ionization (neutral) and high-ionization (ionized) gas, providing a multi-phase view of enrichment shortly after the current starburst and over longer timescales when ejecta from previous episodes have cooled and mixed. We find that O and S, produced predominantly in short-lived massive stars, are well mixed between the two phases, with scatter reflecting local inhomogeneities. Fe, predominantly produced by Type Ia supernovae on $\sim$1 Gyr timescales, is higher in the neutral gas, reflecting either delayed mixing of older Fe-enriched material or preferential depletion of Fe from the ionized phase through dust formation in core-collapse supernova ejecta. N exhibits the largest phase offset, with N/H$_{ion}$ systematically $\sim$0.7 dex higher than N/H$_{neu}$, and the magnitude of this offset correlates with stellar mass, metallicity, star-formation rate, and most strongly with the ISM outflow velocity. N/O ratios in the ionized phase rise rapidly within 3-6 Myr relative to the neutral gas, consistent with N enrichment dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars rather than intermediate-mass AGB stars on longer timescales. These results demonstrate that localized stellar feedback, outflows, and phase-dependent mixing collectively regulate the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, providing key insight into the extreme N/O abundances recently observed in galaxies at cosmic dawn.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06241v1" target="_blank"><h2>A pan-galaxy study of synthetic giant molecular filaments: a turbulence-dominated life cycle</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zipeng Hu, Ke Wang, Mark R.

In this work, we analyze over 700 GMFs identified from synthetic CO emission maps of a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, whose lengths range from $\sim 10$ pc to $\sim 300$ pc. We find that turbulent shock from galactic shear and stellar feedback are the primary drivers of GMF formation. Magnetized turbulence dominates their internal dynamics, supporting the filaments against global collapse while simultaneously inducing fragmentation into dense clumps. This fragmentation follows the turbulence-driven sausage instability model, rather than pure Jeans instability, and triggers efficient star formation along the filaments. Cloud-cloud collisions are frequent, affecting more than $70\%$ of GMFs, and often disrupt or reshape their morphology. The typical filamentary lifetime is $t_{\text{fil}} \sim 14$ Myr, comparable to the crossing time of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). The molecular gas half-life is $\sim 7$ Myr, similar to that of GMCs, indicating that GMFs are transient but dynamically important structures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06223v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effects of helium sedimentation on late star formation in galaxy clusters</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{14} M_{\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\rm sun} \lesssim M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{15} M_{\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions. For clusters with a halo mass $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{15} M_{\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects can potentially be very important and renew star formation activity in the central galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06159v1" target="_blank"><h2>From the Intergalactic to the Interstellar Scales -- EQUALS: a High-resolution Legacy Survey of Gas in the Distant Universe Using ESPRESSO</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Trystyn Berg, Valentina D'Odorico, Elisa Boera, Giorgio Calderone, Rodrigo Cuellar, Guido Cupani, Stefano Cristiani, Simona Di Stefano, Andrea Grazian, Francesco Guarneri, Vid Iršič, Sebastian Lopez, Dinko Milaković, Pasquier Noterdaeme, Luca Pasquini, Matteo Viel, Louise Welsh<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 pages, published in ESO Messenger<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), galaxy formation (abstract), quasar absorption lines (abstract), AGN (abstract), quasar (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Understanding how the Universe evolved from diffuse primordial gas into the rich cosmic web we observe today is one of the great challenges of modern astrophysics. Quasar absorption lines - the imprints left by intervening gas on the light from distant quasars - provide key diagnostics of many aspects of this investigation, ranging from fundamental physics to cosmology and galaxy formation. The unprecedented combination of extremely precise wavelength calibration, high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) has finally enabled observations that will further constrain both state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution and theoretical stellar nucleosynthetic yields.

We generate populations of synthetic black hole (BH) binaries with masses ranging from the intermediate ($10^3-10^5 M_\odot$) to the supermassive regime ($>10^5 M_\odot$), formed from the dynamical processes of merging halos and their residing galaxies, assuming that each galaxy is initially seeded with a single black hole at its centre. The aim is to estimate the rate of these BH mergers which could be detected by LISA and LGWA. Using PINOCCHIO cosmological simulation and a semi-analytical model based on GAEA, we construct a population of merging BHs by implementing a "light" seeding scheme and calculating the merging timescales using the Chandrasekhar prescription. We provide upper and lower limits of dynamical friction timescale by varying the mass of the infalling object to create "pessimistic" and "optimistic" merger rates respectively. We find that for our synthetic population of MBHs, both LGWA and LISA are able to detect more than $15$ binary IMBH mergers per year in the optimistic case, while in the pessimistic case less than $\sim5$ detections would be possible considering the entire lifetime of the detectors. For SMBHs, the rates are slightly lower in both cases. Most mergers below $z\approx4$ are detected in the optimistic case, although mergers beyond $z=8$ are also detectable at a lower rate. We find that LGWA is better suited for high-SNR IMBH detections at higher redshift, while LISA is more sensitive to massive SMBHs. Joint observations will probe the full BH mass spectrum and constrain BH formation and seeding models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06086v1" target="_blank"><h2>Generalized tension metrics for multiple cosmological datasets</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Matías Leizerovich, Susana J.

Lyman-alpha emission in the EoR is strongly shaped by resonant absorption from neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM), which transforms galactic sources into a low surface-brightness background. In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art THESAN cosmological simulations to produce high-resolution theoretical predictions for future Lyman-alpha LIM studies, constructing continuous light cones for line-of-sight cosmological integrations. We assess the contributions of recombination, collisional excitation, and unresolved HII regions to the total Lyman-alpha spectral intensity. In addition, we explore the IGM in absorption at different redshifts using damping wing analysis. We produce channel maps exploring spatial fluctuations across redshift bands probe-able by LIM instruments. We find that the slope of the absorption-included Lyman-alpha fluctuation power spectrum at smaller scales (k > 10^(-2) 1/arcsec) steepens toward lower redshift, and that our emission-only Lyman-alpha power spectrum lies above the SPHEREx sensitivity, whereas the absorption-included signal is ~4 orders of magnitude lower--providing a conservative lower limit on inhomogeneity signatures and highlighting the importance of including resonant scattering in our model in the future. We also find that including outflows in a simple toy model boosts power by four orders of magnitude. We identify limitations in our analysis and propose next steps, including incorporating the effects of resonant Lyman-alpha scattering and line interlopers, as well as larger simulation volumes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06077v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Song of Lines and Winds: Tracing the Signatures of AGN Outflows in X-rays</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

We investigate UFO signatures by analyzing a broad collection of published detections. Our final sample comprises 122 robust (> 2$σ$) UFO detections in 57 AGN, spanning wide ranges in redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio. By combining phenomenological and photoionization modeling of the absorption features, we characterize empirical correlations among UFO properties. We find that line width, equivalent width, and outflow velocity are positively correlated, indicating that the broadest and strongest absorption lines trace the fastest winds, although the $\upsilon_\mathrm{out} - σ$ trend is comparatively weak. The large inferred velocity dispersions, often exceeding the uncertainty on the centroid velocity, must be included when estimating wind energetics and scaling relations. From the velocity constraints we derive lower limits on the launching radii, finding a minimum distance consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit of a weakly or non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. We also assess for the first time how UFO properties depend on AGN class: differences between Seyferts and quasars, bridged by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, appear to be driven mainly by black hole mass and luminosity. The observed co-variation of velocity, width, and equivalent width supports a picture of clumpy, multi-component winds propagating through a thermally unstable multiphase medium within the chaotic cold accretion (CCA) cycle, and is consistent with both magnetically and line-driven acceleration. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with missions such as XRISM and NewAthena will be crucial to resolve the structure, kinematics, and physical origin of these flows.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06072v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lyman-$α$ Visibility During the Epoch of Reionization: Combining JWST FRESCO Grism Data with Keck Archival Spectroscopy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ecaterina Leonova, Rohan P.

We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population. The overdensity parameters for LAEs and [OIII] emitters without Lyman-$α$, calculated for sources with $\mathrm{M_{UV}<-19.5}$ to ensure completeness, are similar, indicating that overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-$α$ visibility. While LAEs have slightly higher recent star formation (SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{50} \approx 1.3\times$) and [OIII] EW ($\approx1.5\times$), they show no significant differences from [OIII] emitters in UV slope ($β$), UV magnitude ($\mathrm{M_{UV}}$), or stellar mass ($\log_{\mathrm{M}_{\star}}$). Our results suggest that other factors may contribute to the observability of Lyman-$α$ emission. Future spectroscopic surveys with broader wavelength coverage and more complete sampling will be crucial for refining our understanding of reionization.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06075v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Galactic Transformation -- Understanding the SMC's Structural and Kinematic Disequilibrium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Himansh Rathore, Gurtina Besla, Roeland P. van der Marel, Nitya Kallivayalil<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The SMC is in disequilibrium. Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/σ\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R>2$ kpc, and a small ($<10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R<2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06068v1" target="_blank"><h2>Do Low-Mass, Low-Luminosity AGNs Deviate from the Quasar Main Sequence?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Himanshu Sharma, Vivek Kumar Jha, Hum Chand, Swayamtrupta Panda<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables and additional 2 figures in appendix.

While the narrow line widths are consistent with the formal definition of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, the broader accretion and emission properties reveal key distinctions. The sample exhibits sub-Eddington accretion rates (median $\log R_{Edd} \approx -0.68$) and comparatively weak FeII emission (median $R_{FeII} \approx 0.61$), in contrast to the strong FeII strengths and high Eddington ratios characteristic of classical NLSy1s. Optical variability amplitudes, derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, are similar to those typically seen in Seyfert 1 galaxies, with a median $\log(σ) \approx -0.68$, suggesting the AGN component's significant contribution to variability. In the optical plane of the 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter space, these sources occupy a distinct locus in the low-$R_{FeII}$, low-$R_{Edd}$ regime, suggesting a physically distinct accretion state. Our findings indicate that this population may represent a low-accretion analogue within the broader narrow-line AGN family, offering new insights into black hole growth at low mass scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06071v1" target="_blank"><h2>The quenched fraction of satellites around simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Francisco J.

To enable consistent comparisons, we select Milky Way-mass hosts with $M_{\rm halo} = 10^{11.9}$ - $10^{12.2} \, M_{\odot}$ and satellites with stellar masses of $10^{7}$ - $10^{10}\, M_{\odot}$, applying uniform projected apertures and a common quenching definition. All three simulations reproduce the strong observed trend that lower-mass satellites are more likely to be quenched, closely matching the stellar-mass dependence seen in SAGA, ELVES, and the MW+M31 system. This agreement indicates that the mass dependence of satellite quenching is a robust outcome of contemporary galaxy formation models. Radial trends, however, show meaningful differences. SAGA and ELVES exhibit gently declining quenched fractions with projected distance, reflecting strong environmental quenching at small radii. TNG50 most closely matches this behavior, FIREbox, remains consistent with with a nearly flat trend within uncertainties, and the FIRE-2 zoom-ins show suppressed inner quenched fractions driven almost entirely by their paired MW-M31 hosts, which lack high-mass satellites and show strong radial segregation between star-forming and quenched systems. This environmental imprint suggests that host environment and assembly history can influence satellite quenching outcomes and may contribute to diversity across simulations. Overall, while the simulations consistently recover the stellar-mass dependence of quenching their radial trends vary, highlighting the influence of host-halo conditions and motivating deeper exploration of how host environments shape satellite quenching.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05914v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMAGAL VI.

The ALMAGAL project observed $\sim1000$ clumps at $\sim$1000\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $Λ_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\sim2.2$, but $e\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $λ^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\approx3\timesλ^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05909v1" target="_blank"><h2>Learning the Cosmic Web: Graph-based Classification of Simulated Galaxies by their Dark Matter Environments <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dakshesh Kololgi, Krishna Naidoo, Amelie Saintonge, Ofer Lahav<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables, submitted to Royal Astronomical Society Techniques and Instruments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05899v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1).

However, supervised machine-learning approaches require large quantities of labelled examples to train on, and the limited number of known strong lenses has lead to a reliance on simulations for training. A well-known challenge is that machine-learning models trained on one data domain often underperform when applied to a different domain: in the context of lens finding, this means that strong performance on simulated lenses does not necessarily translate into equally good performance on real observations. In Euclid's Quick Data Release 1 (Q1), covering 63 deg2, 500 strong lens candidates were discovered through a synergy of machine learning, citizen science, and expert visual inspection. These discoveries now allow us to quantify this performance gap and investigate the impact of training on real data. We find that a network trained only on simulations recovers up to 92% of simulated lenses with 100% purity, but only achieves 50% completeness with 24% purity on real Euclid data. By augmenting training data with real Euclid lenses and non-lenses, completeness improves by 25-30% in terms of the expected yield of discoverable lenses in Euclid DR1 and the full Euclid Wide Survey. Roughly 20% of this improvement comes from the inclusion of real lenses in the training data, while 5-10% comes from exposure to a more diverse set of non-lenses and false-positives from Q1. We show that the most effective lens-finding strategy for real-world performance combines the diversity of simulations with the fidelity of real lenses. This hybrid approach establishes a clear methodology for maximising lens discoveries in future data releases from Euclid, and will likely also be applicable to other surveys such as LSST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05898v1" target="_blank"><h2>Differentially rotating neutron stars with dark matter cores <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lorenzo Cipriani, Violetta Sagun, Kalin V.

In this work, we extend the numerical code RNS to describe two gravitationally coupled fluids in differential rotation, with baryonic matter modeled by a realistic nuclear equation of state and dark matter represented as a self-interacting bosonic condensate. Within this framework, we construct equilibrium sequences for a representative differential rotation law, providing a basis to explore how dark matter may influence the global properties and rotational dynamics of binary neutron star remnants.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05847v1" target="_blank"><h2>A redshift-independent theoretical halo mass function validated with the Uchuu simulations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elena Fernández-García, Juan E.

Building on a generalised Press & Schechter model and triaxial collapse (GPS+), we predict the HMF in terms of the variance of the linear density field, with only a weak explicit dependence on halo mass and no explicit dependence on redshift. The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 < log($M_{\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\odot}$]) <16 over 0 < z < 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z < 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within ~20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan & Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05839v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hadronic Emissions from the Microquasar V4641 Sgr, SS433, and its implications in the Diffuse Galactic Emission <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Basanti Paul, Abhijit Roy, Jagdish C.

Recent detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{GeV}$) and ultra-high-energy (UHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{TeV}$) gamma-rays by LHAASO, HAWC and HESS from the MQ V4641 Sgr and SS 433 suggests them as Galactic PeVatrons. In this work, we studied a hadronic origin of the observed TeV-PeV gamma-ray emission from these MQs. We considered the hadronic scenario where the gamma-rays are produced by the interaction of relativistic protons in the MQ jet with the stellar wind. We fitted our model with observed data and constrained physical parameters like the hadronic jet power fraction, the proton spectral index, the maximum proton energy and the jet bulk Lorentz factor. Our best-fit model shows hard proton spectra ($1.84-2.44$) and maximum proton energies between 1 and 5 PeV. We also estimated the all-flavor neutrino fluxes corresponding to the gamma-ray fluxes from the hadronic model and found that V4641 sgr can be detected by next-generation neutrino telescopes like KM3NeT-ARCA and TRIDENT. Furthermore, we modeled a synthetic population of Galactic MQs and estimated their contribution to the diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray flux. For the inner Galaxy PSR contribution dominates in the range 10-100 TeV, and above 100 TeV diffused cosmic ray interactions with the molecular clouds is most dominant. We find that a population $\sim 14$ MQs is required to explain the LHAASO data above 100 TeV. For the outer Galaxy, we show that MQs are the dominant class of sources, and we constrain their population $\sim$14. Our findings strongly suggest that MQs are efficient particle accelerators, contributing to Galactic PeVatrons and potential multimessenger sources in our Galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05819v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on nDGP gravity from SPT galaxy clusters with DES and HST weak-lensing mass calibration and from Planck PR4 CMB anisotropies <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

On scales below the nDGP crossover scale $r_{\rm c}$, the nDGP model features an effective gravity-like fifth force that alters the growth of structure, leading to an enhancement of the halo mass function (HMF) on cluster scales. The enhanced cluster abundance allows for constraints on the nDGP model using cluster samples. We employ the SPT cluster sample, selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and with mass calibration using weak-lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample contains 1,005 clusters with redshifts $0.25 < z < 1.78$, which are confirmed with the Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm using optical and near-infrared data. Weak-lensing data from DES and HST enable a robust mass measurement of the cluster sample. We use DES Year 3 data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z < 0.95$, and HST data for 39 clusters with redshifts $ 0.6 < z <1.7$. We account for the enhancement in the HMF through a semi-analytic correction factor to the $νΛ$CDM HMF derived from the spherical collapse model in the nDGP model. We then further calibrate this model using $N$-body simulations. In addition, for the first time, we analyze the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from Planck PR4 within the nDGP model. We obtain a competitive constraint from the joint analysis of the SPT cluster abundance with the Planck PR4 data, and report an upper bound of $1/\sqrt{H_0r_{\rm c}}< 1.41$ at $95\%$ when assuming a cosmology with massive neutrinos.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05807v1" target="_blank"><h2>SRG/eROSITA-SDSS view on the relation between X-ray and UV emission for quasars <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

These objects are bright both in X-rays and in the optical, so that the sample is characterized by nearly 100% statistical completeness. We have developed a new method for determining the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation, which consistently takes into account (i) X-ray and UV flux limited object selection, (ii) X-ray and UV variability of quasars, and (iii) the decreasing space density of quasars with increasing luminosity. Assuming a linear relation between $l_{\rm X}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2keV}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$ and $l_{\rm UV}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2500}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$, we find the slope, $γ=0.69\pm0.02$ (hereafter all uncertainties are quoted at the 68% confidence level), and normalization, $l_{\rm X}=26.45\pm0.02$ at $l_{\rm UV}=30.5$, of the $L_{\rm 2keV}$ ($L_{\rm 2500}$) dependence. These values are not substantially different from the results of previous studies. A key novel aspect of our work is allowance for intrinsic scatter (which adds to the dispersion induced by quasar variability and flux measurement uncertainties) of the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation in both variables, i.e. in X-ray and UV luminosity. The intrinsic X-ray scatter ($σ^2_{\rm intX}=0.066\pm0.005$) strongly dominates over the UV one ($σ^2_{\rm intUV}=0.001^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$). Further studies should seek to explain this behaviour in terms of accretion onto supermassive black holes and orientation of quasars with respect to the observer.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05801v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stability of the Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Plane under the Influence of Neighbors <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

The role of the quadrupole component of the potential, which at distances greater than 50 kpc is associated with the distribution of matter in the Galaxy's neighborhood (mainly with the influence of the galaxy M31), is studied. It is shown that perturbations of the potential created by the environment can significantly change the trajectories of particles at distances greater than 100 kpc from the Galactic center, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the still poorly known trajectory of the galaxy M31. For some variants of this trajectory, structures resembling a "thin plane" of satellite galaxies cannot exist for more than 2-3 billion years.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05739v1" target="_blank"><h2>The X-ray/UV Connection in NGC 5548: A Rapidly Varying Corona <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

The observations reveal a strong correlation between the UV and optical variability, but a weaker correlation between the X-ray and UV bands, challenging the standard X-ray reprocessing scenario. We revisit the X-ray/UV connection in NGC 5548 by fitting archival 2014 HST and Swift/XRT light curves assuming X-ray reverberation from a dynamically evolving X-ray corona. Our results show that, as long as the corona height, photon index and power vary over time, X-ray reverberation can explain the observed UV and optical variability within 2% and 5%, respectively (on average). The evolution of the best-fit parameters suggests that fast changes in coronal geometry and energetics on a time scale of days are required to explain the observed variability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05719v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar cores live long and prosper in cuspy dark matter halos <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jenni Häkkinen, Alexander Rawlings, Till Sawala, Matthew G.

It has recently been claimed based on dynamical arguments that perfectly cored stellar systems cannot survive inside cuspy dark matter halos, which would make the observation of stellar cores in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where dark matter cores cannot form through baryonic processes, a direct falsification of the cold dark matter paradigm. Here, we use idealized simulations to show explicitly that cored stellar systems like those observed in dwarf galaxies can be stable within cuspy dark matter halos over at least several Hubble times. We also demonstrate that observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies cannot distinguish mildly positive, flat, or negative inner density slopes, further precluding the dynamical inference of the gravitational potential from the stellar configuration.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05694v1" target="_blank"><h2>Inelastic Majorana Dark Matter and Its Self-Interactions in a Gauged $U(1)_{L_μ- L_τ}$ Model <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kwei-Chou Yang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, hep-ex<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 61 pages, 15 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We develop an inelastic Majorana dark matter model gauged by $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, featuring a complex scalar and fermions with a small Dirac mass. The model exhibits strong interactions between the dark fermion-antifermion pair and the scalar, with a large coupling generating a Majorana mass after symmetry breaking. The dark fermion splits into two nearly degenerate Majorana eigenstates, with the $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge boson $Z^\prime$ interacting via inelastic axial vector currents. The lighter Majorana serves as dark matter (DM), while the heavier may also contribute. The model predicts DM masses ranging from about 10 GeV to hundreds of GeV, with the scalar favored below 100 MeV. Strong coupling causes DM particles to mainly annihilate into two scalars, which determines the relic abundance, while thermal equilibrium with the bath occurs through $Z^\prime$ interactions. Self-interacting DM particles scatter via ladder exchange of strongly coupled light scalars, helping resolve small-scale issues. The $Z^\prime$ interacts with the muon, affecting its magnetic moment and explaining the $(g-2)_μ$ discrepancy. Effects on experiments, $N_{\text{eff}}$, and the Hubble tension from kinetic mixing between $Z^\prime$ and the photon, originating from high-energy scales, are discussed. The model details and parameter constraints used in experiments are also covered.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 62 papers (50 new, 12 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
