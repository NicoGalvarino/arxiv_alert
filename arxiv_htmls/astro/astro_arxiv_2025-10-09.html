to play important roles in affecting the star formation and evolution of host
galaxies, but their relationship is still unclear. As a pilot study, we
performed a detailed spectral analysis for a radio-loud (RL) AGN 3C~59
($z=0.1096$) by systematically considering various factors that may affect the
fitting results, and thereby establishing a general spectral fitting strategy
for subsequent research with larger sample. 3C~59 is one rare target for
simultaneously studying jets and warm absorbers (WAs) that is one type of
ionized outflows. Based on the multi-wavelength data from near-infrared (NIR)
to hard X-ray bands detected by DESI, GALEX, and XMM-Newton, we used SPEX code
to build broadband continuum models and perform photoionization modeling with
PION code to constrain the physical parameters of WAs in 3C~59. We found two
WAs with ionization parameter of $\log [\xi/(\rm{erg\ cm\ s}^{-1})] =
2.65^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ and $1.65\pm 0.11$, respectively, and their outflowing
velocities are $v_{\rm out} = -528^{+163}_{-222}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and
$-228^{+121}_{-122}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. These WAs are located
between outer torus and narrow (emission-)line region, and their positive
$v_{\rm out}$-$\xi$ relation can be explained by the radiation-pressure-driven
mechanism. We found that the estimations of these physical properties are
affected by the different spectral fitting strategies, such as the inclusion of
NIR to ultra-violet data, the choice of energy range of spectrum, or the
composition of the spectral energy distribution. Based on the same fitting
strategy, this work presents a comparative study of outflow driven mechanism
between a RL AGN (3C 59) and a radio-quiet AGN (NGC 3227), which suggests a
similar driven mechanism of their WA outflows and a negligible role of jets in
this process.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06325v1" target="_blank"><h2>Preferential Accretion onto the Secondary Black Hole Strengthens

waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of
binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this
gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and
empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential
accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential
solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based
analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population,
and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the
binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH
mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a
factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that
only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is
needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into
agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect
on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries
at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help
explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts
observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the
first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves.
Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by
any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06347v1" target="_blank"><h2>MEGATRON: Disentangling Physical Processes and Observational Bias in the

optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the
interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra
remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to
address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a
suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly
non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star
formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting
spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of
feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal
enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields
compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe -- in agreement with
interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to
infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope
of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some
high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of
ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and
N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models
populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line
ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of
the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong
constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the
high-redshift Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07259v1" target="_blank"><h2>The cosmic web's Lyman-$α$ glow at $z \approx 2.5$; varying

predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present
theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made
using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al.
2024, point to its discovery at $z \approx 2.5$. Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$
surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic
simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood),
incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and
recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness
predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in
the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations
presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is
observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness
facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web.
These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond
inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the
faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the
Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06753v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Sample of HeII $λ$4686 "Changing-Look" Quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Wentao Lu, Jun-Xian Wang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 13 figures.

the broad He ii $\lambda$4686 emission line in quasars, utilizing repeated
spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The He ii line,
originating from high-ionization gas and powered by extreme ultraviolet
photons, serves as a sensitive tracer of changes in the ionizing continuum.
After applying strict spectral selection criteria and visual inspection to a
parent sample of over 9,000 quasars with multi-epoch spectra, we identify a
sample of 34 He ii "changing-look" quasars that show a significant appearance
or disappearance of the broad He ii $\lambda$4686 line. Compared with
previously known H$\beta$ "CL" quasars, the He ii "CL" sample exhibits
similarly strong continuum variability and broad-line flux changes, yet shows a
preference for higher Eddington ratios and lower host-galaxy contamination.
These results highlight the value of He ii line in studying the central
variable engines of AGNs and uncovering a more complete census of extreme
quasar variability. A comparison with H$\beta$ "CL" further underscores the
profound selection biases inherent in "changing-look" studies, especially those
associated with line strength, host-galaxy contamination, and spectral
signal-to-noise ratio.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06853v1" target="_blank"><h2>MEGATRON: The environments of Population III stars at Cosmic Dawn and

III formation in the MEGATRON suite of
simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium
chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at
Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well
below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular
hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the
$10^4$~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting
new Pop. III stars occurs within $100$ Myr of the first Pop. III star as the
Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to $10^{-21}\,\rm
erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$. We find that the global Pop. III star
formation rate stabilizes to a value of $10^{-3}\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ at
$z=20$. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in
mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical
enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes
undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming
stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough,
they can form up to $\sim100$ Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be
observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at
a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only $0.06\%$ of Pop.
III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} < -17$.
Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to $z=0$, we find that
$75-80\,$% reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue,
while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including
satellite halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07303v1" target="_blank"><h2>Confirming Near- to Mid-IR Photometrically-Identified Obscured AGNs in

Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) through near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting out to z ~ 3. For massive galaxies, log(M) >
9.5, our high resolution spectra of the rest optical range generally confirm
the results of SED fitting, which relies primarily on excesses above the
stellar emission between 1 and 6 microns to identify AGN. However, the method
is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass
galaxies, log(M) < 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 -
6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by
purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared
properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template. However,
relatively few star forming galaxies emit as strongly in the 3 - 6 micron range
as this template, so this could result in missing some obscured AGNs to avoid a
minor contamination. Including the behavior of the galaxies at rest lamda ~
13.5 microns can mitigate this problem and yield more complete samples of bona
fide AGN. JWST/MIRI supports this approach out to z ~ 0.6.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06310v1" target="_blank"><h2>MUSEQuBES: Physical conditions, origins, and multi-element abundances of

(ISM) into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to reproduce their observed low
metallicities, but measurements of dwarf CGM properties are scarce. We present
a study of the CGM of an isolated dwarf at $z=0.5723$ with a stellar mass of
$\approx5\times10^7\rm\,M_{\odot}$ and star-formation rate ($\approx0.05\,\rm
M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$) and ISM metallicity ($\rm [O/H]\approx-0.9$) consistent with
the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. A background
quasar sightline with archival UV spectra probes the dwarf's CGM at a projected
distance of 28 kpc, corresponding to approximately half of the estimated virial
radius. The dwarf's CGM is detected in H I, intermediate metal ions of C III, O
III, and O IV, and kinematically broader, highly-ionized O VI, but is
undetected in N IV and Ne VIII. Photoionization modeling of the intermediate
ions indicates a modest volume-filling factor ($\sim 6\%$ along the sightline
or $\sim 2\%$ globally), and a mass of $\sim2\times10^8 {\rm\,M_\odot}$,
$\sim4\times$ higher than the dwarf's stellar mass, but $\sim10\times$ less
than the highly ionized CGM. The O VI kinematics are comparable to the dwarf's
estimated virial velocity, suggesting it is likely associated with cool,
photoionized, and volume-filling CGM, with bulk motion or turbulence dominating
over thermal pressure. The metallicity inferred for the intermediate ions is
$\rm [O/H]=-0.6$, but with low relative abundances of $\rm [C/O]=-0.6$ and $\rm
[N/O]<-0.9$. The [N/O] is below levels expected of the dwarf's ISM, but
consistent with core-collapse supernova ejecta, suggesting that
supernova-enriched gas escaped the dwarf without mixing significantly with ISM
enriched in nitrogen from evolved, low-mass stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06905v1" target="_blank"><h2>The radial acceleration relation at the EDGE of galaxy formation:

galaxies has been reported over a wide range of mass ($10^8 < M_{\rm bar}/{\rm
M}_\odot < 10^{11}$) - the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This has been
interpreted as evidence that dark matter is actually a manifestation of some
modified weak-field gravity theory. In this paper, we study the radially
resolved RAR of 12 nearby dwarf galaxies, with baryonic masses in the range
$10^4 < M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot < 10^{7.5}$, using a combination of
literature data and data from the MUSE-Faint survey. We use stellar
line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the
mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We
compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with
similar stellar masses in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the
observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of
the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a
multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while
there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that
the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred
baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on
its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave
similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We
show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these
results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way,
nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the
galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results
provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest
dwarf galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07306v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing evolution of Long GRB properties through their cosmic formation

back into the epoch of reionization, and a large dataset with known redshifts
($z$) is an important ingredient for these studies. Usually, $z$ is measured
using spectroscopy or photometry, but $\sim80\%$ of GRBs lack such data. Prompt
and afterglow correlations can provide estimates in these cases, though they
suffer from systematic uncertainties due to assumed cosmologies and due to
detector threshold limits. We use a sample with $z$ estimated via machine
learning models, based on prompt and afterglow parameters, without relying on
cosmological assumptions. We then use an augmented sample of GRBs with measured
and predicted redshifts, forming a larger dataset. We find that the predicted
redshifts are a crucial step forward in understanding the evolution of GRB
properties. We test three cases: no evolution, an evolution of the beaming
factor, and an evolution of all terms captured by an evolution factor
$(1+z)^\delta$. We find that these cases can explain the density rate in the
redshift range between 1-2, but neither of the cases can explain the derived
rate densities at smaller and higher redshifts, which may point towards an
evolution term different than a simple power law. Another possibility is that
this mismatch is due to the non-homogeneity of the sample, e.g., a
non-collapsar origin of some long GRB within the sample.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06812v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST observations of photodissociation regions: II. Warm molecular

tool to study photodissociation regions, where radiative feedback from massive
stars on molecular clouds is dominant. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its
high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique
access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial
morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the
Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas
temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study
of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the
PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction
throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to
the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in
different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the
observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight
decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the
OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho
rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and
preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the
OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P >
6x10$^6$ K cm$^{-3}$, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We
highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the
intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead

PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase
induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07220v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-energy variability of the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS

study the broad-band spectral properties and the high-energy variability of the
gravitationally-lensed blazar PKS 1830-211, for which radio observations have
revealed two images, to put constraints on the jet physics and the existence of
a gravitationally-induced time delay and magnification ratio between the
images. We utilize Swift/XRT, Nustar, and Fermi-LAT observations from 2016 and
2019 to compare periods of low activity and high activity in PKS 1830-211.
Short-timescale variability is elucidated with an unbinned power spectrum
analysis of time-tagged NuSTAR photon data. To study the
gravitationally-induced time delay in the gamma-ray light curve observed with
Fermi-LAT, we improve existing autocorrelation function based methods. Our
modified auto-correlation method yields a delay of t_0=21.1 +/- 0.1 d and
magnification factor a=0.13 +/- 0.01. These parameters remain time-invariant.
In data from 2016 and 2019, the X-ray spectra remain remarkably stable,
contrasting with extreme changes in gamma-rays. Both states can be fitted with
a single component from Comptonisation of infrared emission from the dusty
torus, with different gamma-ray states arising solely from a shift in the break
of the electron energy distribution. The detection of a consistent lag
throughout the whole light curve suggests that they originate from a persistent

a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer
break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are
believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas,
leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining
the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$,
and $H\delta$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring
Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We
decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components.
Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all
objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by
more than $5\sigma$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust
attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $H\alpha$/$H\beta \approx 1.8$.
Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae,
associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases
can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140,
shows a high broad $H\alpha$/$H\beta$, but $H\gamma$/$H\alpha$ and
$H\delta$/$H\alpha$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case
B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to
increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density
(log$n_e$ > 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does
hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured
($A_V\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the
extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general
ISM of the host galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05687v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Comparison of Star Formation Rates by Different Tracers in Nearby
  Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Huynh Anh N.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey with high-quality data to compare star formation rates
(SFRs) across multiple diagnostic methods and examine their connection to
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) strength, indicated by Eddington ratio. Our
sample encompassed star-forming (SF), composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies.
Our analysis utilizes various SFRs indicators, including observed infrared flux
($\rm SFR_{FIR}$) from AKARI/Herschel ($\sim$4,100 sources), the MPA-JHU
catalog ($\rm SFR_{Dn4000}$), the ANN catalog ($\rm SFR_{ANN}$), the GSWLC
catalog ($\rm SFR_{SED}$ and $\rm SFR_{MIR}$), as well as \OII\ and \Ha\
emission lines ($\rm SFR_{[OII]}$ and $\rm SFR_{H\alpha}$). Within SF galaxies,
SFRs measurements from different tracers exhibited differences, with offsets
and scatter below 0.26 dex and 0.29 dex, respectively. Moreover, non-SF
galaxies (composite, Seyfert, and LINER) displayed discrepancies among SFR
tracers, particularly for LINER galaxies, with offsets below 0.86 dex and a
scatter of 0.57 dex. Additionally, our findings revealed robust correlations
between SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs) with Eddington ratios. Eddington ratio
exhibited gradual transitions in the (s)SFRs-stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies
with high Eddington ratios displayed high star formation activity, similar to
blue SF galaxies. Furthermore, we observed decreasing sSFR trends from SF
galaxies to composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our results may provide
insight into our understanding of (s)SFRs traced by different approaches and
their connection to AGN activities.</p></br></body>
