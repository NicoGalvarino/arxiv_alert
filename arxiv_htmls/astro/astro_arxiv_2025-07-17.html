process during galaxy evolution. This model utilizes the evolution of star
formation rate, derived from the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs)
across different redshifts, and the cold gas content, derived from the
NeutralUniverseMachine model, to constrain gas accretion and recycle of gas
outflow in the model galaxy. Additionally, through detailed modeling of each
cycle process, particularly the recycling process, and utilizing the gas-phase
mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=0$ as a constraint, our model establishes
a relation between the recycle fraction and halo mass. It is found that the
fraction of gas recycled from the outflow is a function of halo mass, with a
value of $25\%$ in galaxies with halo mass $\sim10^{10.4}M_{\rm \odot}$,
increasing to $75\%$ in halos with mass $\sim 10^{12}M_{\rm \odot}$. We also
find that the mass loading factor from the FIRE-2 simulation matches well with
the constraints from both observational data and our model. Furthermore, using
the gas content and metallicity of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtained
from hydrodynamical simulations as constraints, our model predicts that on
average $70\%$ of universal baryon accretion is accreted to the halo and $80\%$
of the non-recycled gas in the outflow has escaped from the galaxy, entering
the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, we note that future observational data
are needed to finally constrain the mass and metal exchange between the CGM and
the IGM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11613v1" target="_blank"><h2>COS-EDGES: Co-rotation and Kinematic Stratification of the Multi-Phase

kinematic connection between the ISM and multi-phase circumgalactic medium
(CGM) in nine isolated, edge-on galaxies at z~0.2, each probed along its major
axis by a background quasar at impact parameters of 13-38kpc. Using VLT/UVES
and HST/COS quasar spectra, we analyse MgI, MgII, HI, CII, CIII, and OVI
absorption relative to galaxy rotation curves from Keck/LRIS and Magellan/MagE
spectra. We find that at lower $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir}\leq 0.2$), over 80% of
absorption in all ions lies on the side of systemic velocity matching disk
rotation, and the optical-depth-weighted median velocity ($v_{abs}$) is
consistent with the peak rotation speed. At higher $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir} >
0.2$), the kinematics diverge by ionisation state: For low ionisation gas, the
amount of co-rotating absorption remains >80%, yet $v_{abs}$ drops to 60% of
the galaxy rotation speed. For high ionisation gas (OVI), only 60% of the
absorption is consistent with co-rotation and $v_{abs}$ drops to 20% of the
rotation speed. Furthermore, the velocity widths, corresponding to 50% of the
total optical depth ($\Delta v_{50}$) for low ionisation gas is 1.8 times
larger in the inner halo than at larger radii, while for CIII and OVI $\Delta
v_{50}$ remains unchanged with distance. These results suggest a radially
dependent CGM kinematic structure: the inner halo hosts cool, dynamically broad
gas tightly coupled to disk rotation, whereas beyond 0.2$R_{vir}$, particularly
traced by OVI and HI, the CGM shows weaker rotational alignment and lower
velocity dispersion. Therefore, low-ionisation gas likely traces extended
co-rotating gas, inflows and/or recycled accretion, while high-ionisation gas
reflects a mixture of co-rotating, lagging, discrete collisionally ionised
structures, indicating a kinematic stratification of the multi-phase CGM.

probes of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. However, modeling this
population remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black
hole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the
hydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this
study, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy
formation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine
AGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the
MillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their
host galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic
gas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie
below the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly
preceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily
produced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive
reionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original
IllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1,
resulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty
growth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain
significantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to
incorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in
which we artificially boost the AGN luminosity. This results in strong effects
on the surrounding gas, most notably a proximity effect, and large
contributions to He ionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11602v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unmixed metals: Variations in the enrichment of z~4 sub-damped Lyman

constraints on the properties of the first generations of stars in the
Universe. We present the chemical abundances of five very metal-poor
([M/H]<-2.5) sub damped Lyman alpha systems (subDLAs) covering the redshift
range $3.6<z<4.3$, identified with the XQ-100 survey. We find that the subDLAs
in our sample show consistent chemical abundance patterns (in particular [C/O],
[Al/O], and [Fe/O]) with those of very metal-poor DLAs. Based on Voigt profile
fitting, the chemical abundance ratios [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] of individual
velocity components in at least three of the subDLAs shows some intrinsic
scatter. In order to verify these chemical inhomogeneities in absorption
components, we present a novel method for computing ionization corrections
(ICs) on a component-by-component basis and show that ICs alone cannot explain
the variations in [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] between components of the same
absorber at ~2 sigma significance. Comparing the observed abundance ratios to
the simulated core-collapse supernovae yields of early stellar populations, we
find that all individual components of the subDLAs appears to be enriched by
progenitor masses of <30 M_sol. The observed inhomogeneities between components
can be reproduced by differences in the progenitor mass or supernova explosion
energy. As such, the observed chemical inhomogeneities between components can
be explained by poorly mixed gas from different nucleosynthetic events.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11664v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematics of Circumgalactic O VI Gas and Disk Rotation of $z\approx0.2$
  Star-forming Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Stephanie H. Ho, Crystal L. Martin, Hasti Nateghi, Glenn G. Kacprzak, Jonathan Stern</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ. 35 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (title, abstract), quasar (abstract), CGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates
with the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that
the gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations
ubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\sim L^*$
star-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk,
especially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O
VI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk
rotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\approx0.2$
star-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) within 45$^\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while
individual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the
bulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match
O VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of
their velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion
matches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more
likely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI
velocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the
extended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches
represent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is
theoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular
momentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent
to mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12275v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of young and evolved stars in the heating of dust in local

Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and
plays a critical role in galaxy evolution. Dust grains influence the ISM by
cooling the gas, altering its chemistry, and absorbing stellar radiation,
re-emitting it at longer wavelengths in the far-infrared (FIR) and
sub-millimeter regimes. The cold dust component, which dominates the dust mass,
is primarily heated by stellar radiation, including both young, massive stars
and the diffuse emission from older stars. Understanding dust heating is
essential to trace the connection between stellar populations and their
environments.
  Aims. We aim to identify the dominant heating mechanisms of the cold dust in
typical nearby spiral galaxies and explore the contributions of young and
evolved stars to dust heating.
  Methods. Using 18 large, face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia project,
we apply two complementary approaches: (1) correlation analysis between dust
temperature (T_dust), SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR), and stellar mass surface
density (Sigma_Mstar); and (2) study of the relationship between T_dust and
dust mass surface density (Sigma_dust).
  Results. T_dust peaks at ~24 K in galaxy centers and drops to ~15 K at large
radii. Galaxies with and without AGNs show similar T_dust profiles. For ~72% of
the sample, both methods agree on the dominant heating source. Overall, we find
that both young and evolved stars contribute to dust heating, with their
relative roles varying between galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12120v1" target="_blank"><h2>No evidence for Keplerian taper of far-out galactic rotation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Adriana Bariego-Quintana, Felipe J.

isothermal-like density profile, or alternatively with a very prolate halo-. To
decide whether we adopt the null (Rubin behaviour) or alternative (NFW

its last data points. We conclude that the data is presently compatible with
the null hypothesis -no taper off, no decline of $v(r)$ is seen.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11603v1" target="_blank"><h2>THOR: a GPU-accelerated and MPI-parallel radiative transfer code</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Chris Byrohl, Dylan Nelson</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), AGN (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Emission and absorption line features are important diagnostics for the
physics underlying extragalactic astronomy. The interpretation of observed
signatures involves comparing against forward modeled spectra from galaxy
formation simulations as well as more simplified geometries, while including
the complex scattering radiative transfer (RT) of resonant emission lines.
Here, we present thor, a modern C++ radiative transfer code focused initially
on resonant emission lines. thor is a high-performance, distributed memory
MPI-parallel, multi-target code, running on CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators,
yielding large $\sim 10-50\rm{x}$ speed-ups compared to previous CPU-only
codes. We support multiple grid-based and gridless data structures, enabling
comparisons across different hydrodynamical codes as well as toy model
geometries. We demonstrate its science capabilities with a number of example
use cases across scales: (i) Lyman-alpha RT on simple shell-like gas
distributions; (ii) Lyman-alpha RT applied to a high-resolution, high-redshift
$z \sim 6$ cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation; (iii)
Lyman-alpha and Magnesium-II halos, i.e. scattering and emission from the
circumgalactic medium of $z \simeq 1-2$ galaxies drawn from cosmological
magnetohydrodynamical simulations; (iv) the large-scale cosmic web in gas
emission, a $6144^3$ volume-element RT scaling calculation; and (v) synthetic
absorption spectra of the Lyman-alpha forest. Extensive verification and
benchmarking validates our approach and its computational efficiency.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11658v1" target="_blank"><h2>CLASSY XIV: Nitrogen Enrichment Shaped by Gas Density and Feedback</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Karla Z.

star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide
range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen
abundances via the direct-$T_{\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to
density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age,
compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those
of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV
nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic
time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns
with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that
galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant
redshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between
electron density $n_{\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure
contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with
high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong
correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity
outflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to
elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results
highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young
stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for
interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12046v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIGHTEE: A first look at MIGHTEE quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sarah V.

the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields of the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered

are selected via $gJK_s$ colour-space and, with 1.3-GHz flux-densities reaching
rms ~ 3.0$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, we find a radio-loudness fraction of 5 per cent.
Thanks to the deep, multiwavelength datasets that are available over these
fields, the properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars can be studied in
a statistically-robust way, with the emphasis of this work being on the
active-galactic-nuclei (AGN)-related and star-formation-related contributions
to the total radio emission. We employ multiple star-formation-rate estimates
for the analysis so that our results can be compared more-easily with others in
the literature, and find that the fraction of sources that have their radio
emission dominated by the AGN crucially depends on the SFR estimate that is
derived from the radio luminosity. When redshift dependence is not taken into
account, a larger fraction of sources is classed as having their radio emission
dominated by the AGN. When redshift dependence $is$ considered, a larger
fraction of our sample is tentatively classed as 'starbursts'. We also find
that the fraction of (possible) starbursts increases with redshift, and provide
multiple suggestions for this trend.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11600v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Resolved kinematic studies of main sequence

($\sim1$kpc) ALMA observations of the [CII]158$\mu$m line emission. This data
set enables the first systematic kpc-scale characterisation of the kinematics
nature of typical massive SFGs at these epochs. We find that $\sim50\%$ of the

high-velocity dispersions ($\sigma_0$), with a median disk velocity dispersion
of $\sim70{\rm kms^{-1}}$ and $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0\sim2$, and consistent with
dominant gravity driving. The elevated disk dispersions are in line with the
predicted evolution based on Toomre theory and the extrapolated trends from
$z\sim0$-$2.5$ MS star-forming disks. The inferred dark matter (DM) mass
fraction within the effective radius $f_{\rm DM}(<R_{\rm e})$ for the disk
systems decreases with the central baryonic mass surface density, and is
consistent with the trend reported by kinematic studies at $z\lesssim3$;
roughly half the disks have $f_{\rm DM}(<R_{\rm e})\lesssim30\%$. The CRISTAL

the high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical
inhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and

radio spectra of high-redshift radio-loud quasars by intervening neutral
hydrogen, offers a uniquely sensitive probe of the thermal state of the neutral
intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization. Although over 30
such quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in
practice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption
features, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent
studies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a
statistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise
ratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines
for recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$,
incorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We
show that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially
outperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective
method dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net
to extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter
regression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM
neutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT
sightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time
relative to existing techniques. We publicly release our code, training data,
and models. Beyond the 21-cm forest, these results underscore the promise of
hybrid deep learning and gradient-boosted inference techniques for extracting
physical information from low-SNR data across astrophysics.</p></br></body>
