  in galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Francesco Calura</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Invited Review submitted to Galaxies, 102 pages, 17 Figures. Comments welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Despite its small mass fraction typically observed in the interstellar
medium, dust plays a significant role as a key component of galaxies, affecting
a wide range of properties. This review focuses specifically on how dust grains
influence interstellar chemical abundances and on the processes that regulate
the evolution of the galactic dust budget. I describe the main physical
processes regulating dust evolution, including production by stars and other
sources, destruction in supernova shocks and interstellar growth and how they
are included in galactic chemical evolution models. I discuss the main effects
of interstellar dust on the abundances measured in various high-redshift
systems that include Damped Lyman alpha absorbers detected along the lines of
sight of distant quasars and in the absorption spectra of Gamma Ray Burst
afterglows. I discuss the measure of the dust mass in galaxies and review its
global budget, evaluated through the study of the evolution of the comoving
dust mass density, for which I present an up-to-date compilation of data chosen
from the literature. Interstellar dust growth plays a critical role in
regulating the dust budget, for which I present a list of evidence both in
favour of it and against. The dust budget at high redshift is one aspect that
requires attention to drive significant progress in the future, along with the
investigation of the properties of dust in local, low-metallicity systems. Our
poor theoretical knowledge of basic aspects related to dust evolution evidences
the need for a new high-sensitivity space telescope operating in the
far-infrared regime, still awaited by the community since the demise of
Herschel.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13736v1" target="_blank"><h2>DESI survey of S IV absorption outflows in quasars: Contribution to AGN
  feedback and comparison with [O III] emission outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mayank Sharma, Nahum Arav, Maryam Dehghanian, Gwen Walker, Kyle Johnston, Matthew Kaupin, Justin Gandhi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for Publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Quasar outflows can play a crucial role in the evolution of their host
galaxies through various feedback processes. This effect is expected to be
particularly important when the universe was only 2-3 billion years old, during
the period known as cosmic noon. By utilizing observations from the Dark Energy
Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI), we conduct a survey of high-ionization quasar
outflows at cosmic noon, with the aim of doubling the current sample of such
outflows with distance and energetics determination. We also aim to compare
these properties to those derived from spatially resolved outflows in similar
quasars probed through Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS). In a sample of 130
quasars we detect signatures of high-ionization outflows in the form of a S IV
trough in eight objects. We characterize the physical conditions of these
outflows by determining their total hydrogen column density ($N_H$), ionization
parameter ($U_H$), and electron number density ($n_e$). The detected outflows
show complex kinematic structures with a wide range in blueshifted velocities
(100$-$4600 km s$^{-1}$). We locate five out of the eight outflows at distances
between 240$-$5500 pc away from the central source. From the combined sample of
15 high-ionization S IV outflows at cosmic noon, we find a high fraction (up to
46 %) of them to be powerful enough to contribute significantly to multi-stage
AGN feedback processes. Their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities are
also found to be consistent with spatially resolved outflows in a luminosity
and redshift matched sample of quasars. Comparison with previous spectra
reveals interesting variations in some objects, with two cases of emerging
high-velocity broad absorption line features with velocities of $-$8000 and
$-$39,000 km s$^{-1}$. An impressive case of four line-locked Si IV outflow
systems is also revealed in one of the objects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14482v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$α$
  Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Eli Visbal, Greg L. Bryan, Zoltan Haiman</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 6 figures, submitted to JCAP</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$
absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical
signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body
simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict
the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA
predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects
such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment
(all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo
clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their
carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly
ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals
primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop
III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to
better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at
$z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons.
First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs
with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the
number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the
Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and
metal-enriched star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13907v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extreme AGN feedback in the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  D.

regulate the star formation rate of galaxies and prevent the formation of
ultra-massive galaxies ($M_\star>10^{12}M_\odot$). However, the mechanism
through which the outflowing energy is transferred to the surrounding medium
strongly varies from one galaxy evolution model to another, such that a unified
model for AGN feedback does not currently exist. The hot atmospheres of galaxy
groups are highly sensitive laboratories of the feedback process, as the
injected black hole energy is comparable to the binding energy of halo gas
particles. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of the fossil galaxy
group SDSSTG 4436. The hot atmosphere of this system exhibits a highly relaxed
morphology centred on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~3298. The X-ray emission
from the system features a compact core ($<$10 kpc) and a steep increase in the
entropy and cooling time of the gas, with the cooling time reaching the age of
the Universe $\sim15$ kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The observed entropy
profile implies a total injected energy of $\sim1.5\times10^{61}$ ergs, which
given the high level of relaxation could not have been injected by a recent
merging event. Star formation in the central galaxy NGC~3298 is strongly
quenched and its stellar population is very old ($\sim$10.6 Gyr). The currently
detected radio jets have low power and are confined within the central compact
core. All the available evidence implies that this system was affected by giant
AGN outbursts which excessively heated the neighbouring gas and prevented the
formation of a self-regulated feedback cycle. Our findings imply that AGN
outbursts can be energetic enough to unbind gas particles and lead to the
disruption of cool cores.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13863v1" target="_blank"><h2>Feature Intensity Mapping: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission from
  All Galaxies Across Cosmic Time</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yun-Ting Cheng, Brandon S. Hensley, Thomas S. -Y. Lai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 13 figures, submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the
aggregate emission of a spectral line from all sources, without requiring
individual detections. Through the wavelength-redshift relation, one can map
the line-of-sight evolution of the line emission that traces the underlying
large-scale structure in a spectral-imaging survey. In this work, we present a
new technique -- feature intensity mapping -- as an extension of the LIM
formalism to map broad spectral features in 3D, rather than the narrow emission
lines typically targeted by LIM. By accounting for the convolution of spectral
features with the instrument's spectral response across redshift, our technique
enables simultaneous constraints on the redshift-dependent emission from
multiple features. This approach enables 3D intensity mapping with some of the
brightest features in galaxies' infrared spectra: the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands. We forecast the detectability of PAH signals
using feature intensity mapping with the ongoing SPHEREx mission in the
near-infrared and the proposed PRIMA mission in the far-infrared. We find that
$S/N$ of $\gtrsim 10$ per redshift bin of widths $\Delta z = 0.1$ and $0.5$ can
be achieved at $z < 0.5$ and $1 < z < 5$ with SPHEREx and PRIMA, respectively,
for multiple PAH features, suggesting a promising prospect for mapping the
aggregate PAH emission at cosmological distances with upcoming datasets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14441v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas motion in the ICM of the Virgo cluster replica</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Théo Lebeau, Stefano Ettori, Jenny G. Sorce, Nabila Aghanim, Jade Paste</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A, 17 pages, 9 figures and 1 table</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Within the deep gravitational potential of galaxy clusters lies the
intracluster medium (ICM). At the first order, it is considered to be at
hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing
that the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and
provides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we
intend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a
simulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected
properties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density
functions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal
pressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the
velocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF)
from projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the
components of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along
equivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from
filaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity
field to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in
particular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated
from direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections,
comparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear
relation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard
deviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift
of X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\%$
within $R_{500}$ and $9\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion,
which is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs. Finally, we show
that the VSF might probe the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback turbulent
injection scale.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13945v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: The potential of slitless infrared spectroscopy: A z=5.4 quasar

with templates. The quasar was identified by its strong and broad CIII] and
MgII emission lines in the NISP RGE 1206-1892 nm spectrum, and confirmed
through optical spectroscopy from the Large Binocular Telescope. The NISP Blue

can find bright quasars at z~5.5 and z>7, redshift ranges that are challenging
for photometric selection due to contamination from ultracool dwarfs. EUCL
J181530.01+652054.0 is a high-excitation, broad absorption line quasar detected
at 144 MHz by the LOw-Frequency Array (L144=4e25 W/Hz). The quasar has a

Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and
orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC)
populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution
of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical
friction and mass loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to track
the trajectory of about 18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies
from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and
ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to
confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like
galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E < 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm
hm}^{*})$ where $E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular
orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results
challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in
the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the
two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ
GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ
clusters at $E > 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$, and that the real challenge
lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this
context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs
observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature.
Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin,
they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within
MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and
$L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time
and by dynamical friction, respectively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13005v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling of the High Column Density systems in The Lyman-Alpha Forest</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  T.

Zou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Lyman-alpha forests observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars can
be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological
information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations.
While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the
intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics
of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with
column densities log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 17 to damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs)
with log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 20.2. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption
characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the
power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a
scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a
model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column
densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias
of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically
well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable
to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss
the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and
their bias is uncertain.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13716v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mass models of galaxy clusters from a non-parametric weak-lensing

for weak gravitational lensing observations. This method is non-parametric,
allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities,
without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes
spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to
significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass
profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and
baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are
consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation
curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions,
finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend
strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass
profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH
clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (3) The
non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation
expected in $\Lambda$CDM; fitting parametric NFW halos to the non-parametric
mass profiles gives results in overall agreement with the expected
mass-concentration relation, though the concentrations are relatively poorly
constrained. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic
Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined
by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass
extrapolation at large radii. Contrary to some previous results based on
hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that galaxy clusters may fall on the same BTFR
and RAR as galaxies if one adds a suitable positive baryonic mass component.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14310v1" target="_blank"><h2>A measurement of Galactic synchrotron emission using MWA drift scan

arc-minute angular scale is important to remove the foregrounds for the
cosmological 21-cm observations. Statistical measurements of the large-scale
DGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray
electron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \, {\rm
MHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\cal C}_{\ell})$ of the DGSE of
a region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\circ}$ to $70.3^{\circ}$
at the fixed declination $-26.7^{\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24
pointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources
above $\sim430 \, {\rm mJy}\,(3\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded
Estimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\cal C}_{\ell}$. We use the
angular multipole range $65 \le \ell \le 650$ to fit the data with a model,
${\cal C}^M_{\ell}=A\times \left(\frac{1000}{\ell}\right)^{\beta}+C$, where we
interpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\propto \ell^{-\beta})$
nature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the
residual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}$ for
six PCs centered at $\alpha=352.5^{\circ}, 353^{\circ}, 357^{\circ},
4.5^{\circ}, 4^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \beta$
and $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to
$400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find
that the value of $\beta$ is consistent at $2-\sigma$ level with the earlier
measurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14016v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DORCHA suite: nature, nurture, and the phase space distribution of

present-day phase-space distribution of this ancient component. We find that
this material is highly centrally concentrated at $z=0$, with 90 - 100 per cent
residing within $r \lesssim 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$. It exhibits steep
density profiles ($\rho\propto\,r^{-4}$), low velocity dispersions ($\sigma_r /
\sigma_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.6$), and radially biased orbits ($\beta \gtrsim
0.5$ for $r \gtrsim 0.1\,R_{200}$), consistent with a relaxed, centrally
embedded population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation
histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature of early
progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions. Our findings imply
that the fossil record of the first generations of stars -- including
Population III and extremely metal-poor stars -- should be sought in the
innermost regions of the Milky Way, where they retain distinctive kinematic
imprints. While these stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low
metallicity does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The
DORCHA suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for interpreting
observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys targeting the bulge and inner
halo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14595v1" target="_blank"><h2>Heating of a Molecular Cloud by a Primordial Black Hole</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A. N. Melikhov, E. V.

High-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope reveals a symmetric
stellar disk coupled to a unilateral tail of star-forming knots to the south.
We show that these extra-planar continuum sources are embedded within an
ionized gas tail that is kinematically connected to the disk of
COSMOS2020-635829. Likely representing the highest-redshift discovery of a ram
pressure stripped ionized gas tail. The tail sources are characterized by
extremely young stellar populations ($\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Myr}$), have
stellar masses of ${\sim}10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and star formation rates of
$0.1\text{--}1\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. This work reinforces the notion
that ram pressure stripping can perturb group and cluster galaxies at $z > 1$
and likely contributes to environmental quenching even near Cosmic Noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13237v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stochastic background of gravitational waves from cosmic-rays</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aurélien Barrau, Juan García-Bellido, Killian Martineau, Daryna Yushchenko</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic-rays are charged particles moving in magnetic fields.

Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Clumps in the rest-frame UV emission of galaxies have been observed for
decades. Since the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a large
population is detected in the rest-frame near-infrared (NIR), raising questions
about their formation mechanism. We investigate the presence and properties of
NIR over-densities (hereafter substructures) in star-forming and quiescent
galaxies at 1 < z < 4 to understand their link to the evolution of their host
galaxy. We identify substructures in JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W residual
images at a rest-frame wavelength of 1 um.
  The fraction of galaxies with substructures with M* > 10^9 Msun has been
steadily decreasing with cosmic time from 40% at z = 4 to 10% at z = 1. Clumps,
the main small substructures in the rest-frame NIR, are the most common type
and are much fainter (2% of the flux) than similar UV clumps in the literature.
Nearly all galaxies at the high-mass end of the main sequence (MS), starburst,
and green valley regions have substructures. However, we do not find
substructures in low-mass galaxies in the green valley and red sequence.
Although massive galaxies on the MS and in the green valley have a 40%
probability of hosting multiple clumps, the majority of clumpy galaxies host
only a single clump.
  The fraction of clumpy galaxies in the rest-frame NIR is determined by the
stellar mass and SFR of the host galaxies. Its evolution with redshift is due
to galaxies moving towards lower SFRs at z < 2 and the build-up of low-mass
galaxies in the green valley and red sequence. Based on their spatial
distribution in edge-on galaxies, we infer that most of substructures are
produced in-situ via disk fragmentation. Galaxy mergers may still play an
important role at high stellar masses, especially at low SFR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14510v1" target="_blank"><h2>ODIN: The LAE Lyα Luminosity Function over Cosmic Time and

Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) ideal tracers for cosmology. In addition,
because Ly$\alpha$ is a resonance line, but frequently observed at large
equivalent width, it is potentially a probe of galaxy evolution. The LAE
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) is an essential measurement for making
progress on both of these aspects. Although several studies have computed the
LAE LF, very few have delved into how the function varies with environment. The
large area and depth of the One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands
(ODIN) survey makes such measurements possible at the cosmic noon redshifts of
z~2.4, ~3.1, and ~4.5. In this initial work, we present algorithms to
rigorously compute the LAE LF and test our methods on the ~16,000 ODIN LAEs
found in the extended COSMOS field. Using these limited samples, we find slight
evidence that protocluster environments either suppress the numbers of very
faint and very bright LAEs or enhance medium-bright LAEs in comparison to the
field. We also find that the LF decreases in number density and evolves towards
a steeper faint-end slope over cosmic time from z~4.5 to z~2.4.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13314v1" target="_blank"><h2>Propagation of Galactic cosmic rays: the influence of anisotropic
  diffusion</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ala'a AL-Zetoun</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays in the large-scale
Galactic magnetic field, where diffusion occurs at different rates along and
across the magnetic field lines. To model this process, we use stochastic
differential equations to describe cosmic ray propagation and solve them
numerically. The Galactic magnetic field is modeled using the Jansson-Farrar
prescription. In this study, we focus on the impact of perpendicular diffusion
on the residence time of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. This allows us to estimate
how anisotropic diffusion influences both the residence time and the total
amount of matter (grammage) traversed by a typical cosmic ray during its
journey through the Galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13422v2" target="_blank"><h2>Jet outbursts, non-thermal pressure and the AGN jet duty cycle</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andrew Sullivan, Ross J. Turner, Stanislav S. Shabala, Chris Power, Sophie A. Young</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Added further acknowledgements</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy
clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We
model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law
distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase
jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding
gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to
total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP
fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and
for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles,
the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of
the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with
observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small
non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a
relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty
cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of
the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is
consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose
this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of
real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13852v1" target="_blank"><h2>Overmassive black holes in the early Universe can be explained by

($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\rm{\ast}$) relation in the early Universe, while remaining
consistent the BH-dynamical mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$) relation.
We predict BH masses for $z>3$ galaxies in the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM
simulations by assuming the $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation is
fundamental. Even without live BH modelling, our approach reproduces the
JWST-observed $M_\mathrm{BH}$ distribution, including overmassive BHs relative
to the local $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{\ast}$ relation. We find that
$M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{\ast}$ declines with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$, evolving from
$\sim$0.1 at $M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to $\sim$0.01 at
$M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. This trend reflects the dark
matter ($f_\mathrm{DM}$) and gas fractions ($f_\mathrm{gas}$), which decrease
with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$ but show little redshift evolution down to $z=3$,
resulting in small $M_\mathrm{\ast}/M_\mathrm{dyn}$ ratios and thus overmassive
BHs in low-mass galaxies. We use $\texttt{Prospector}$-derived stellar masses
and star-formation rates to infer $f_\mathrm{gas}$ across 48,022 galaxies in
JADES at $3<z<9$, finding excellent agreement with our simulation. Our results
demonstrate that overmassive BHs would naturally result from a fundamental
$M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation and be typical of the gas-rich, dark
matter-dominated nature of low-mass, high-redshift galaxies. Such overmassive,
rapidly growing BHs may strongly influence the earliest stages of galaxy
formation.</p></br></body>
