the circumgalactic medium, profoundly impacting galaxy evolution. These
phenomena are intrinsically linked to the physical conditions of the medium,
which is permeated by magnetic (B) fields affecting its transport and dynamics.
Here, we spatially resolve, $0.24$" (96 pc), the B-fields in the dusty and
molecular outflows of Arp 220, the closest ($78$ Mpc) Ultra-Luminous Infrared
Galaxy hosting two interacting nuclei, denoted as East and West. We perform
ALMA $870~\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line
polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line
polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust
polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a
linear polarization fraction of $0.4\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected
circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W
reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the
dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization
of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at
$4-6\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly
polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\sim110^{\circ}$
connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the
blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong
B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and
supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent
kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of
metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26111v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accretion rates of stellar-mass compact objects embedded in AGN discs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Cheng-Liang Jiao, Liying Zhu, Er-gang Zhao, Jia Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar-mass compact objects (COs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN)
discs are commonly assumed to accrete via Bondi or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL)
prescriptions, neglecting gas angular momentum. We show that differential
rotation in AGN discs can impart non-negligible angular momentum, in which case
accretion proceeds through a viscous disc rather than Bondi/BHL flow. Our model
provides a new framework estimating the CO accretion rate as
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{CO} = \min\{\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}, \dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}\}$,
where the viscous rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}$ accounts for gas--CO relative
motion decomposed into a local gradient term (due to differential rotation) and
bulk motion (from differing orbital parameters). This rate can be expressed as
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} = \alpha \xi
(r_\mathrm{H}/r_\mathrm{BHL})^3\dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}$, where $\xi$ is a
coefficient of order unity. It can also be approximately scaled to the global
AGN accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} \propto \dot{M}_1$, with the
scaling coefficients in both forms determined by the specific dynamical
configuration. The accretion is viscosity-limited when $q > [\alpha
\xi(1+\mathcal{M}^2)^{3}/3]^{1/2} h^3$, where $q$ is the mass ratio between the
CO and the supermassive black hole, $\alpha$ the viscosity parameter,
$\mathcal{M}$ the Mach number of the bulk relative motion, and $h$ the aspect
ratio of the AGN disc. In thin AGN discs this condition is satisfied for most
stellar-mass or more massive COs. Our framework also naturally allows for the
inclusion of established outflow corrections, thereby enabling a more realistic
treatment of super-Eddington flows. Our formulation thus improves upon
Bondi/BHL prescriptions and offers a more physically motivated basis for
studying CO evolution in AGN environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26218v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rotation Measure Analysis of Shocks and Sloshing Fronts in a Galaxy

ZuHone</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent observations of the Fornax cluster show depolarization signatures on
megaparsec scales, which may be associated with shocks and/or sloshing motions
during cluster merger and/or in-fall. To investigate the possible reasons
behind the depolarization, we carry out analytical and full polarized radiative
transfer (PRT) calculations of radio point sources behind a merging galaxy
cluster simulated using the FLASH code. With uniform background light, we
analyzed the rotation measure (RM) morphology near the shock front and the
cluster center, where sloshing cold fronts appear. For the shock scenario, we
find a local RM enhancement by $\sim56\%$ behind the shock front on megaparsec
scales, arising from the compression of hot gas and magnetic field lines.
Behind the sloshing cold front, the cluster center shows decrement in RM
magnitude by $\sim23.3\%$, as a result of the cancellation effect of
randomly-oriented magnetic fields induced by sloshing-driven turbulence. We
find that beam depolarization increases behind shock fronts and across sloshing
cold fronts, indicating enhanced magnetic field fluctuations across the plane
of the sky in both scenarios. By fully accounting for all radiative transfer
coefficients in the PRT calculations, the uniform background light becomes more
depolarized near the cluster center, with the effect growing more pronounced as
background intensity decreases. This suggests that synchrotron emission and
Faraday rotation of the intracluster medium can significantly influence the
polarization of background sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26716v1" target="_blank"><h2>Active Dwarf Galaxy Database II: Connections between Host Galaxy

Accepted to The Astrophysical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the connection between accretion signatures and host galaxy
properties in the context of how active dwarf galaxies are identified. We use
the database constructed in Wasleske & Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf
galaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy,
infrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability.
Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these
methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of
these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active
by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy
properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active
galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties
using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN
selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest
star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key
population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher
AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star
formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic
diagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to
the sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of
accretion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25844v1" target="_blank"><h2>Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) XI: Circumgalactic O VI

and regulates galaxy growth, but the multiphase, diffuse gas in this region is
challenging to observe. We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O
VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat,
will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict
the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range
$z=1\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy
structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI
surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\sim10^{5.5}$ K,
inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of
the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM
gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more
widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission
primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation
without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission.
Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow
it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O
VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting
onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that
the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc
from the galaxy center for $\sim L^\star$ galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26436v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optimizing Long-term Variability of AGN Light Curves. I. A Case Study

dynamics and central engine physics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The
quality and completeness of light curves have a direct impact on variability
studies, particularly for faint AGNs and high-redshift AGNs. To improve the
quality of long-term light curves for AGNs, we bin and stack multi-epoch images
balancing the image depths and temporal resolution. As a case study, we apply
this method to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations in the Extended
Groth Strip (EGS) field, where the overlapping region covers an area of about
370 arcmin$^2$ and includes $g$-band and $r$-band data taken from March 2018 to
December 2024. The co-added images are approximately 2.0 to 2.5 magnitudes
deeper than the ZTF single-epoch images. With co-added images, we construct
light curves for 73 AGNs in the EGS field. Compared to the traditional ZTF
light curves, our light curves maintain consistent long-term variability trends
but with higher photometric precision. Furthermore, this method can help detect
AGNs with weak variability which are missed from the traditional ZTF data due
to the noisy light curves or below the detection limit in ZTF's single-epoch
exposure. Among the 73 AGNs, the majority exhibit a bluer-when-brighter (BWB)
trend on long-term timescales, which is consistent with previous studies. This
work offers insights for optimizing AGN light curves in both current and
upcoming all-sky time-domain surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25833v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the quasar disc-wind-jet connection with LoTSS and SDSS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Charlotte L.

rates and black hole masses of a sample of $\sim$100k quasars at z $\approx$ 2.
Combining spectra from the 17th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) with radio fluxes from the 2nd data release of the Low Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), we statistically characterise a radio
loud and radio quiet population using a two-component Gaussian Mixture model,
and perform population matching in black hole mass and Eddington fraction. We
determine how the fraction of radio loud sources changes across this parameter
space, finding that jets are most efficiently produced in quasars with either a
very massive central black hole ($M_{\textrm{BH}} > 10^9 \textrm{M}_{\odot}$)
or one that is rapidly accreting ($\lambda_{\textrm{Edd}}>0.3$). We also show
that there are differences in the blueshift of the CIV $\lambda$1549{\AA} line
and the equivalent width of the HeII $\lambda$1640{\AA} line in radio loud and
radio quiet quasars that persist even after accounting for differences in the
mass and accretion rate of the central black hole. Generally, we find an
anti-correlation between the inferred presence of disc winds and jets, which we
suggest is mediated by differences in the quasars' spectral energy
distributions. The latter result is shown through the close coupling between
tracers of wind kinematics and the ionising flux -- which holds for both radio
loud and radio quiet sources, despite differences between their emission line
properties -- and is hinted at by a different Baldwin effect in the two
populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26513v1" target="_blank"><h2>CROCODILE-DWARF: Assembly and Kinematics of Field Dwarf Galaxies with

hydrodynamic simulations of isolated field dwarf galaxies with halo masses of
$\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$ at $z=0$, performed with the \textsc{gadget4-osaka}
code. The simulations include detailed modeling of star formation, chemical
enrichment, and supernova feedback using the \textsc{CELib} and
\textsc{grackle} libraries, achieving baryonic resolutions of
$\sim2\times10^3\,M_\odot$. Our study focuses on how assembly history governs
the structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the
$\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed
stellar-to-halo mass, mass--metallicity, and size--mass relations, yielding
stellar masses of $10^6-10^8\,M_\odot$ and metallicities consistent with those
of Local Group dwarf galaxies. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational
support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars.
Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo
assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration
halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while
late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star
formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We identify a clear anti-correlation
between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction,
demonstrating that dynamical heating by mergers is the dominant factor shaping
kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of
extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results
demonstrate that assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, critically
shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25876v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical separation of stellar populations: analytic solutions for

metallicity-dependent (most notably aluminium) have provided an empirical route
for separating different Galactic components. We present 'single-zone' analytic
solutions for the chemical evolution of galaxies when the stellar yields are
metallicity-dependent. Our solutions assume a constant star formation
efficiency, a constant mass-loading factor and that the yields are linearly
dependent on the interstellar medium abundance (with the option of a saturation
of the yields at high metallicity). We demonstrate how the metallicity
dependence of the yields can be mathematically considered as a system-dependent
delay time (approximately equal to the system's depletion time) that, when
combined with system-independent delay times arising from stellar evolutionary
channels, produces the separation of different systems based on their star
formation efficiency and mass-loading factor. The utility of the models is
highlighted through comparisons with data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey.
We provide a comprehensive discussion of the chemical evolution models in the
[Al/Fe]-[Mg/Fe] plane, a diagnostic plane for the separation of in-situ and
accreted Galactic components. Extensions of the models are presented, allowing
for the modelling of more complex behaviours largely through the linear
combination of the presented simpler solutions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25909v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the Universality of the Relation Between Magnetic Fields and Star

dynamics and star formation. These fields correlate with supernova (SN)-driven
turbulence, but whether the scaling is universal across galaxy properties, ISM
phases, and energy budgets remains unclear. We quantify the dependence of
magnetic fields on star formation activity including both regular and starburst
galaxies. We analyse 19 spiral disks from the cosmological RTnsCRiMHD Azahar
suite, deriving line-of-sight integrated maps to measure median magnetic-field
strength ($B$), specific energies (thermal, turbulent, magnetic, and
cosmic-ray), and star formation rate (SFR), star formation surface density
($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) and specific SFR (sSFR). We find an almost universal
magnetic-field-SFR scaling with slope $\alpha \approx 0.2$-$0.3$ across galaxy
mass and ISM phases. The $B$-$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ slope ($\alpha \approx
1/3$) supports an SN-driven, turbulence-regulated origin. Neutral gas is
generally turbulence-dominated and in near equipartition with magnetic energy
for systems with sSFR $\gtrsim 0.1$ Gyr$^{-1}$ and SFR $\gtrsim 1$ $M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$. The simulated trends match observations with similar slopes ($\alpha
\approx 0.25$-$0.35$), indicating that SN-driven turbulence is the main
amplification mechanism behind the near-universal $B$-SFR relation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26305v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of black hole feedback on galaxy star formation and the

the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate.
The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of
AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and
contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved
issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow
galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via
abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of
their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the
empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption
that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit
imposed by the observed $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ relation, as a proxy of
SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\rm BH} -
\sigma_\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched
galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid.
In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling
relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an
$M_{\rm BH} - M_\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also
naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host
SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and
SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected
in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in
this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across
time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally
suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid
and Rubin-LSST.</p></br></body>
