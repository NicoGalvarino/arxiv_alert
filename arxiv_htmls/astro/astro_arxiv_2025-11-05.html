  Absorption Lines in Quasar Spectra</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yangyang Li, Zhijian Luo, Shaohua Zhang, Du Wang, Jianzhen Chen, Zhu Chen, Hubing Xiao, Chenggang Shu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), cosmic evolution (abstract), AGN (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars serve as critical probes for
understanding active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows, black hole accretion, and
cosmic evolution. To address the limitations of manual classification in
large-scale spectroscopic surveys - where the number of quasar spectra is
growing exponentially - we propose BALNet, a deep learning approach consisting
of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and bidirectional
long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to automatically detect BAL troughs
in quasar spectra. BALNet enables both the identification of BAL quasars and
the measurement of their BAL troughs. We construct a simulated dataset for
training and testing by combining non-BAL quasar spectra and BAL troughs, both
derived from SDSS DR16 observations. Experimental results in the testing set
show that: (1) BAL trough detection achieves 83.0% completeness, 90.7% purity,
and an F1-score of 86.7%; (2) BAL quasar classification achieves 90.8%
completeness and 94.4% purity; (3) the predicted BAL velocities agree closely
with simulated ground truth labels, confirming BALNet's robustness and
accuracy. When applied to the SDSS DR16 data within the redshift range
1.5<z<5.7, at least one BAL trough is detected in 20.4% of spectra. Notably,
more than a quarter of these are newly identified sources with significant
absorption, 8.8% correspond to redshifted systems, and some narrow/weak
absorption features were missed. BALNet greatly improves the efficiency of
large-scale BAL trough detection and enables more effective scientific analysis
of quasar spectra.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01715v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neutral Atomic Hydrogen in a Star-forming Galaxy 7 Billion Years Ago</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Graham Lawrie, Roger Deane, Tariq Blecher, Danail Obreschkow, Ian Heywood, Shilpa Ranchod</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> atomic hydrogen (title, abstract), atomic gas (abstract), molecular gas (abstract), AGN (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) constitutes a key phase of the cosmic baryon
cycle, bridging the ionised circumgalactic medium and the star-forming
molecular gas. Yet, nearly 75 years after its discovery, direct views of HI
through its 21cm emission line remain largely confined to the nearby Universe.
Indirect measurements and statistical analyses indicate little evolution in the
comoving HI density over the past 10 billion years, in stark contrast to the
order-of-magnitude decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density over the
same epoch. Resolving this tension requires direct HI measurements in
individual, representative galaxies at earlier times. Here we report a
detection of HI 21cm emission from the Dragon Arc, a gravitationally lensed
main-sequence star-forming galaxy at $z=0.725$, observed 6.6 billion years in
the past with the MeerKAT radio telescope. The inferred intrinsic HI mass,
$M_{\rm HI}=10^{9.66^{+0.16}_{-0.19}}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and velocity width of
$205^{+66}_{-48}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with expectations from
scaling relations for local star-forming galaxies. The resulting HI depletion
time of $1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.6}\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ is significantly shorter than the
$\sim5-10$ Gyr, measured locally for comparable galaxies. This indicates that
the galaxy must rapidly replenish its atomic gas reservoir to remain on the
star-forming main sequence. This detection demonstrates that strong
gravitational lensing, combined with modern cm-wave facilities, can now reveal
the HI reservoirs of typical galaxies well beyond the local Universe, opening a
new path toward statistical samples that will directly trace the evolution of
the cosmic atomic gas supply.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01195v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the distribution and redshift dependence of host galaxy

understood. The dispersion measure of host galaxy (${\rm DM_{host}}$) provides
critical insights into the local environment of FRB sources. In this study, we
analyze a sample of 117 well-localized FRBs to investigate the statistical
properties of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and its potential correlations with host galaxy
parameters, including redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and
galaxy age. Our results reveal that ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is consistent with a
log-normal distribution, with the mean $\mu_{\rm host}=5.03\pm 0.02$ and
standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm host} = 0.96\pm 0.03$, which corresponds to a
median value ${\rm Med}({\rm DM_{host}})=\exp(\mu_{\rm host})=153\pm 3~{\rm
pc~cm^{-3}}$. We find a moderate positive correlation between ${\rm DM_{host}}$
and redshift, but no statistically significant correlations are found between
${\rm DM_{host}}$ and stellar mass, SFR, or galaxy age. Our findings highlight
the importance of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ as a diagnostic tool for unraveling FRB
origins, and underscore the need for future FRB surveys with deep
multiwavelength host galaxy follow-up.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01750v1" target="_blank"><h2>PRUSSIC III -- ALMA and NOEMA survey of dense gas in high-redshift

critical for understanding the assembly of galaxies throughout cosmic history.
However, due to the faintness of standard dense-gas tracers - HCN, HCO+, and
HNC - dense gas in high-redshift galaxies remains largely unexplored. We
present ALMA and NOEMA observations targeting HCN/HCO+/HNC (3-2) and (4-3)
emission lines in eleven (mostly) gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming
galaxies (DSFGs) at redshift z = 1.6--3.2. We detect at least one line in 10
out of 11 galaxies. Altogether, we detect 34 dense-gas transitions, more than
quadrupling the number of extant high-redshift detections. Additionally, in two
targets, we detect lower-abundance CO isotopologues 13^CO and C^18O, as well as
CN emission. We derive excitation coefficients for HCN, HCO+ and HNC in DSFGs,
finding them to be systematically higher than those in nearby luminous infrared
galaxies. Assuming a canonical dense-mass conversion factor (alpha_HCN = 10),
we find that DSFGs have shorter dense- gas depletion times (median 23 Myr) than
nearby galaxies (~60 Myr), with a star-forming efficiency per free-fall time of
1-2%, a factor of a few higher than in local galaxies. We find a wide range of
dense-gas fractions, with HCN/CO ratios ranging between 0.01 and 0.15. Finally,
we put the first constraints on the redshift evolution of the cosmic dense-gas
density, which increases by a factor of 7+/-4 between z = 0 and z = 2.5,
consistent with the evolution of the cosmic molecular-gas density.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01164v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar halos of bright central galaxies II: Scaling relations, colors

central galaxies (BCGs), focusing on their scaling relations, colors, and
metallicities across cosmic time, and compare model predictions with
ultra--deep imaging data. We use the semianalytic model \textsc{FEGA25},
applied to merger trees from high--resolution dark matter simulations,
including an updated treatment of intracluster light (ICL) formation. SHs are
defined as the stellar component within the transition radius, linked to halo
concentration. Predictions are compared with observations from the VST
Early-type GAlaxy Survey (VEGAS) and Fornax Deep Survey (FDS). The SH mass
correlates strongly with both BCG and ICL masses, with tighter scatter in the
SH--ICL relation. The transition radius peaks at 30--40 kpc nearly independent
of redshift, but can reach $\sim400$ kpc in the most massive halos, after
z=0.5. SHs and ICL show nearly identical color distributions at all epochs,
both reddening toward $z=0$. At $z=2$, SHs and the ICL are $\sim0.4$ dex more
metal--poor than BCGs, but the gap shrinks to $\sim0.1$ dex by the present
time. Observed colors are consistent with model predictions, while observed
metallicities are lower, suggesting a larger contribution from disrupted
dwarfs. SHs emerge as transition regions between BCGs and the ICL, dynamically
and chemically coupled to both. Their properties depend on halo concentration,
ICL formation efficiency, and the progenitor mass spectrum. Upcoming
wide--field photometric and spectroscopic surveys (e.g. LSST, WEAVE, 4MOST)
will provide crucial tests by mapping structure, metallicity, and kinematics in
large galaxy samples.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02009v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quasars acting as Strong Lenses Found in DESI DR1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Everett McArthur, Martin Millon, Meredith Powell, Risa H.

probe the redshift evolution of scaling relations between supermassive black
holes and their host galaxies, particularly the
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{host}}$ relation. Using these powerful probes,
the mass of the host galaxy can be precisely inferred from the Einstein radius
$\theta_{\mathrm{E}}$. Using 812{,}118 quasars from DESI DR1 ($0.03 \leq z \leq
1.8$), we searched for quasars lensing higher-redshift galaxies by identifying
background emission-line features in their spectra. To detect these rare
systems, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on mock lenses
constructed from real DESI spectra of quasars and emission-line galaxies
(ELGs), achieving a high classification performance (AUC = 0.99). We also
trained a regression network to estimate the redshift of the background ELG.
Applying this pipeline, we identified seven high-quality (Grade~A) lens
candidates, each exhibiting a strong [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at a higher
redshift than the foreground quasar; four candidates additionally show H$\beta$
and [O\,\textsc{iii}] emission. These results significantly expand the sample
of quasar lens candidates beyond the twelve identified and three confirmed in
previous work, and demonstrate the potential for scalable, data-driven
discovery of quasars as strong lenses in upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01441v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy assembly bias in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: a

assembly bias (GAB), the dependence of galaxy clustering on quantities other
than halo mass. We investigate how baryonic physics affects the strength and
redshift evolution of GAB using the largest runs of two state-of-the-art
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We quantify
GAB by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass-selected galaxies to that of
shuffled samples, where galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of similar
mass. We find that GAB in both simulations increases from approximately zero at
$z=5$ to a $\sim\,5\%$ change in clustering amplitude at $z=2$. After this
epoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching
$\sim\,10\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further
shuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment --
characterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy
($\alpha_5$) -- we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be
attributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in
both simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo
occupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite
galaxies vary with overdensity -- but only near the respective turn-on masses
for these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very
nearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that
allows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of
density-dependent GAB.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02178v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Extremely Luminous Flare Recorded from a Supermassive Black Hole</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Matthew J.

holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable
sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability
traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature
changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk.
Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole
variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare
by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in
2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical
energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of
approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30
times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few
physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy.
We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass
$(>30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or
a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We
favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN

chronometers, CC) provides us with the unique ability to measure the Universe's
expansion history without assuming a cosmological model. The Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 is currently the largest, publicly
available, homogeneous set of galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts,
and covers a wide range in redshift. We extracted all massive galaxies (stellar
mass $\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot} > 10.75$, and velocity dispersion $\sigma > 280$
km s$^{-1}$), with no emission in [OII] $\lambda$ 3727 $\r{A}$, with reliable
redshifts as well as reliable D4000$_{\rm n}$ measurements from DR1. From this
sample of 360 000 massive, passive galaxies, we used D4000$_{\rm n}$ and the
method of cosmic chronometers to get three new direct, independent measurements
of $H(z)=$ 88.48 $\pm\ 0.57(\rm stat) \pm 12.32(\rm syst)$, $H(z)=$ 119.45
$\pm\ 6.39(\rm stat) \pm 16.64(\rm syst)$, and $H(z)= 108.28 \pm 10.07(\rm

and $z=0.83$, respectively. This sample, which covers $0.3 < z < 1.0$, is the
largest CC sample to date, and we reach statistical uncertainties of 0.65$\%$,
5.35$\%$, and 9.30$\%$ on our three measurements. Our measurements show no
significant tension with the $\textit{Planck}$ $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In our
analysis, we also illustrate that even amongst samples of massive, passive
galaxies, the effect of downsizing can clearly be seen.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01193v1" target="_blank"><h2>CosmoDRAGoN II: Remnant Radio Galaxies in Group and Cluster Environments</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Georgia S.

nuclei (RLAGN) population, representing the quiescent phase in the RLAGN
lifecycle. Despite their observed scarcity, they offer valuable insights into
the AGN duty cycle and feedback processes. Due to the mega-year timescales over
which the RLAGN lifecycle takes place, it is impossible to observe the active
to remnant transition in real-time. Numerical simulations offer a solution to
follow the long-term evolution of RLAGN plasma. In this work, we present the
largest suite (to date) of three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations studying
the dynamic evolution of the active-to-remnant transition and explore the
mechanisms driving cocoon evolution, comparing the results to the expectations
of analytic modelling. Our results show key differences between active and
remnant sources in both cluster environments and in lower-density group
environments. We find that sources in low-density environments can remain
overpressured well into the remnant phase. This significantly increases the
time for the remnant lobe to transition to a buoyant regime. We compare our
results with analytic expectations, showing that the long-term evolution of
radio remnants can be well captured for remnants whose expansion is largely
pressure-driven if the transition to a coasting phase is assumed to be gradual.
We find that remnants of low-powered progenitors can continue to be
momentum-driven for about 10 Myr after the jets switch-off. Finally, we
consider how the properties of the progenitor influence the mixing of the
remnant lobe and confirm the expectation that the remnants of high-powered
sources have long-lasting shocks that can continue to heat the surrounding
medium.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Star Formation Histories and Stellar Dynamics in the Central Galaxies of

and PKS 0745-191, have extended young stellar populations in their centers with
recent star formation rates of 100 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 8 M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, respectively. In A1835 we uncover a massive blueshifted clump of
young stars moving at high speed with respect to the gas and central galaxy. We
suggest this feature is a young population that formed in a gaseous outflow
that has detached from its natal gas and is falling back toward the galaxy.
This result, combined with a companion study (arXiv:2404.02212) tracing nebular
emission which presumably cooled from the hot X-ray atmosphere, indicates that
star formation is proceeding in a dynamically complex environment resulting
from the central galaxy's motion with respect to the cooling clouds and motion
induced by feedback from the central radio jets. In RX J0820.9+0752
intermediate age stars are found in a filament outside of the nucleus with no
discernible star formation at the center of the galaxy. All projected galaxies
are composed of old stellar populations with deep D4000 breaks and are devoid
of detectable warm gas. While in some instances they may be interacting
gravitationally with the central galaxy, they cannot have donated the upward of

well near the LF knee, with very small statistical errors. These errors reveal
that simple analytic forms poorly fit the LFs: the bright end deviates from an
exponential, and the faint end shows complex, non-power-law behaviour. We
detect an upturn at M - 5 log h > -15, stronger in red galaxies. Below -13,
local overdensities and fragmentation of large galaxies amplify this upturn. A
systematic offset between North and South appears at the brightest magnitudes,
driven by red galaxies. Blue LFs match well across regions, suggesting the
discrepancy arises from red galaxy profiles blending into noise in shallower
North photometry. This remains inconclusive, so the bright-end offset is
treated as a systematic uncertainty. We also present LFs using model Petrosian
magnitudes, which are less sensitive to this issue. Splitting by redshift
reveals small but significant residuals, indicating our global evolution model,
while accurate near the LF knee, misses more complex trends. Using Loveday
(2011) redshift limits, we find excellent agreement with GAMA, but with smaller
errors. Our methods and results provide a foundation for studying LF dependence
on environment, such as local density and cosmic web classification, offering
strong constraints on galaxy formation models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01576v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Spatial Distribution of Intra-Cluster Globular Clusters in the
  Fornax Cluster</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Raffaele D'Abrusco, Marco Mirabile, Michele Cantiello, Enrica Iodice, Avinash Chaturvedi, Michael Hilker, Giuseppina Fabbiano, Marilena Spavone, Maurizio Paolillo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ. 41 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the spatial distribution of the Intra-Cluster Globular
Clusters (ICGCs) detected in the core of the Fornax galaxy cluster. By
separately modeling different components of the observed population of Globular
Clusters (GCs), we confirm the existence of an abundant ICGCs over-density with
a geometrically complex, elongated morphology roughly centered on the cluster
dominant galaxy NGC 1399 and stretching along the E-W direction. We identify
several areas in the ICGCs distribution that deviate from a simple elliptical
model and feature large density enhancements. These regions are characterized
based on their statistical significance, GCs excess number, position, size and
location relative to the galaxies in their surroundings. The relations between
the spatial distribution and features of the ICGCs structures, mostly populated
by blue GCs, and properties of the intra-cluster light and dwarf galaxies
detected in the core of the Fornax cluster are described and discussed. The
line-of-sight velocity distribution of spectroscopically confirmed GCs within
the ICGCs structures is compatible with the systemic velocities of nearby
bright galaxies in the Fornax cluster, suggesting that the ICGCs population is
at least partially composed of GCs stripped from their hosts. We argue that the
findings here presented suggest that, on sub-cluster scales, different
mechanisms contribute to the growth of the ICGC. The western region of Fornax
is likely associated with old merging events that predate the assembly of the
Fornax cluster. The eastern side instead points to a mix of tidal disruption of
dwarf galaxies and stripping from the GCSs of massive hosts, more typical of
relaxed, high-density cluster environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02186v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Face-on Accretion Disk Geometry Revealed by Millimeter-wave

Takahashi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyzed 77 epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
archival data to investigate flux variability in Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$),
the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. Among these, we identified
a rare but unusually clear and coherent ~52-minute sinusoidal modulation at 230
GHz, with a statistical significance exceeding 5{\sigma}. Modeling with a
Doppler-boosted hotspot scenario yields an orbital radius of ~4 Schwarzschild
radii and a disk inclination of 8$^\circ$ (or 172$^\circ$), providing the first
direct millimeter wavelength constraint on the inner accretion flow geometry.
This nearly face-on inclination is in good agreement with previous constraints
from GRAVITY and EHT observations. These findings provide robust, independent
evidence that millimeter-wave periodicity can directly probe the innermost
accretion flow geometry, offering a powerful complement to variability studies
at infrared and X-ray wavelengths.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02204v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing the astrometric quality of AGNs in Gaia-CRF3</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shilong Liao, Qiqi Wu, Ye Ding, Qi Xu, Zhaoxiang Qi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 3 figures.

sizes, serve as fundamental anchors for defining the celestial reference frame.
With about 1.9 million AGNs observed in Gaia DR3 at optical precision
comparable to radio wavelengths, Gaia provides a solid foundation for
constructing the next-generation, kinematically non-rotating optical reference
frame. Accurate assessment of systematic residuals in AGN astrometry is
therefore crucial. In this talk, we analysed the parallaxes and proper motions
of Gaia DR3 AGNs to characterize systematic errors and their correlations with
various physical and observational properties. A subset of Gaia-CRF3 AGNs
exhibits significant astrometric offsets, mainly arising from dual or lensed
quasars whose structural variations induce photocenter jitter, mimicking
parallax and proper motion. Such sources must be carefully excluded from
reference frame construction. To this end, we introduce an astrometric quality
index for each source to quantify its astrometric reliability. The results
reveal a strong correlation between lower quality index values and increasing
errors in position, proper motion, and parallax, demonstrating that the
proposed index provides an effective metric for selecting high-fidelity AGNs as
primary reference sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01981v1" target="_blank"><h2>ODIN: Using multiplicity of Lyman-Alpha Emitters to assess star

as a proxy for dark matter halo mass, assess how their radiative properties
relate to the underlying halo conditions, and explore the physics of star
formation activity in LAEs and its relation to possible physically related
companions. We use data from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in
Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, which targets LAEs in three narrow redshift slices.
We identify physically associated LAE multiples in the COSMOS field at $z =
2.4$, $z = 3.1$, and $z=4.5$, and use a mock catalog from the IllustrisTNG100
simulation to assess the completeness and contamination affecting the resulting
sample of LAE multiples. We then study their statistical and radiative
properties as a function of multiplicity, where we adopt the term multiplicity
to refer to the number of physically associated LAEs. We find a strong
correlation between LAE multiplicity and host halo mass in the mocks, with
higher multiplicity systems preferentially occupying more massive halos. In
both ODIN and the mock sample, we find indications that the mean Ly$\alpha$
luminosity and UV magnitude of LAEs in multiples increase with multiplicity.
The halo-wide LAE surface brightness densities in Ly$\alpha$ and UV increase
with multiplicity, reflecting more compact and actively star-forming
environments. The close agreement between the model and ODIN observations
supports the validity of the Ly$\alpha$ emission model in capturing key
physical processes in LAE environments. Finally, a subhalo-based perturbation
induced star formation model reproduces the minimum subhalo mass distribution
in simulations at $z=2.4$, suggesting that local perturbations, rather than the
presence of LAE companions, drive star formation in these systems. For the
higher redshifts, neighbor perturbations do not seem to be the main driver that
triggers star formation.</p></br></body>
