  Properties of High-redshift Galaxies?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Laura Sommovigo, Hiddo Algera</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS, Comments welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Determining the dust properties of high-redshift galaxies from their
far-infrared continuum emission is challenging due to limited multi-frequency
data. As a result, the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) is often modeled
as a single-temperature modified blackbody. We assess the accuracy of the
single-temperature approximation by constructing realistic dust SEDs using a
physically motivated prescription where the dust temperature probability
distribution function (PDF) is described by a skewed normal distribution. This
approach captures the complexity of the mass-weighted and luminosity-weighted
temperature PDFs of simulated galaxies and quasars, and yields far-infrared
SEDs that match high-redshift observations. We explore how varying the mean
temperature ($\bar{T}_d$), width, and skewness of the temperature PDF affects
the recovery of the dust mass, IR luminosity, and dust emissivity index
$\beta_d$ at z=7. Fitting the dust SEDs with a single-temperature
approximation, we find that dust masses are generally well-recovered, although
they may be underestimated by up to 0.6 dex for broad temperature distributions
with a low $\bar{T}_d <$ 40 K, as seen in some high-redshift quasars and/or
evolved galaxies. IR luminosities are generally recovered within the $1\sigma$
uncertainty (< 0.3 dex), except at $\bar{T}_d >$ 80 K, where the peak shifts
well beyond ALMA's wavelength coverage. The inferred dust emissivity index is
consistently shallower than the input one ($\beta_d$=2) due to the effect of
multi-temperature dust, suggesting that a steep $\beta_d$ may probe dust
composition and grain size variations. With larger galaxy samples and
well-sampled dust SEDs, systematic errors from multi-temperature dust may
dominate over fitting uncertainties and should thus be considered.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20143v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the chaos induced by the Galactic bar on the orbits of nearby halo
  stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hanneke C. Woudenberg, Amina Helmi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 11 figures, submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Many of the Milky Way's accreted substructures have been discovered and
studied in the space of energy $E$, and angular momentum components $L_z$ and
$L_{\bot}$. In a static axisymmetric system, these quantities are (reasonable
approximations of) the integrals of motion of an orbit. However, in a galaxy
like the Milky Way with a triaxial, rotating bar, none of these quantities are
conserved, and the only known integral is the Jacobi energy $E_J$. This may
result in chaotic orbits, especially for inner halo stars. Here, we investigate
the bar's effect on the dynamics of nearby halo stars, and more specifically
its impact on their distribution in $(E, L_z, L_{\bot})$ space. To this end, we
have integrated and characterised the orbits of halo stars located within 1 kpc
from the Sun. We computed their orbital frequencies and quantified the degree
of chaoticity and associated timescales, using the Lyapunov exponent and the
frequency diffusion rate. We find that the bar introduces a large degree of
chaoticity on the stars in our sample: more than half are found to be on
chaotic orbits, and this fraction is highest for stars on very bound and/or
radial orbits. Such stars wander in $(E, L_z, L_{\bot})$ space on timescales
shorter than a Hubble time. This introduces some overlap and hence
contamination amongst previously identified accreted substructures with these
orbital characteristics, although our assessment is that this is relatively
limited. The bar also induces a number of resonances in the stellar halo, which
are of larger importance for lower inclination, prograde orbits. Because the
effect of the Galactic bar on the local halo is important for stars on very
bound and/or radial orbits, clustering analyses in these regions should be
conducted with care. Replacing the energy by $E_J$ in such analyses could be an
improvement.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20179v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the detection of caustic crossing events associated with dark matter
  in the form of primordial black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M. R. S. Hawkins</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 16 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The possibility that stellar mass primordial black holes may make up at least
a significant fraction of dark matter has recently received much attention,
partly as a result of gravitational wave observations, but more specifically
from observations of microlensing in the Galactic halo and in quasar
gravitational lens systems. If this is the case then a number of observable
consequences are to be expected. This paper focusses on the prediction that
dark matter in the form of primordial black holes will result in a web of
caustics which when traversed by quasars will result in a complex but
characteristic amplification of the accretion disc light source. Caustic
crossings produce features in quasar light curves which are relatively
straightforward to identify, and are hard to associate with any intrinsic mode
of variation. Microlensing simulations are used to clarify the nature of the
expected light curve features, and compared with observed light curves to
demonstrate that caustic crossing features can be present. A further test of
microlensing is based on the expected statistical symmetry of the light curves,
which is not predicted for most models of intrinsic quasar variability, but is
found in large samples of quasar light curves. The conclusion of the paper is
that observations of quasar light curves are consistent with the expected
microlensing amplifications from dark matter made up of stellar mass primordial
black holes, but cannot easily be explained by intrinsic variations of the
quasar accretion disc.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19844v1" target="_blank"><h2>Magnetic fields in the massive star-forming region NGC 6334 and their
  relationship with the properties of dust filaments probed by [CII] and PAH

Ninan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We carried out the near-infrared ($JHK_{\rm s}$) imaging polarimetric
observation with the polarimeter SIRPOL on the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF)
1.4 m telescope and [CII] line mapping observation with a Fabry-P\'{e}rot
spectrometer on board a 100-cm TIFR balloon-borne far-infrared telescope toward
NGC 6334, and revealed the relationship between the plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic
fields and [CII] emission lines to investigate the star formation in the
molecular cloud. The polarization vector map shows that the POS magnetic fields
are approximately perpendicular to the main filament elongation of NGC 6334. On
the other hand, the POS magnetic fields tend to be parallel or random for the
other filaments in NGC 6334. The [CII] emission shows a distribution well
aligned with the main filament. Strong [CII] emission is also seen in the
hub-filament system. Since the main filament is sandwiched between two HII
regions, it is most likely that gas is efficiently accreting from the shells of
the HII regions along the magnetic field resulting in active star formation.
This is consistent with the NGC 6334 being bright in [CII] emission.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19321v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation of supermassive stars in the first stellar clusters:
  Dependence on the gas temperature</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  P. A. Solar, B. Reinoso, D. R. G. Schleicher, R. S. Klessen, Robi Banerjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 18 figures, submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The origin of supermassive black holes is an open question that has been
explored considering gas- and collision-based formation channels to explain the
high number of quasars observed in the early Universe. According to numerical
simulations, supermassive stars can be formed in atomic cooling halos when
protostars reach accretion rates greater than $\sim
10^{-2}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ and fragmentation is inhibited on parsec
scales. It remains uncertain, however, whether fragmentation on smaller scales
leads to the formation of a star cluster instead of a supermassive star in the
presence of possible cooling mechanisms. We explored the formation of a central
massive object through collisions and the accretion of Population III stars in
a primordial gas cloud in a gravitationally unstable system by varying the gas
temperature and the degree of gravitational instability. We performed
multiphysics simulations in the AMUSE framework with a hydrodynamical gas
treatment through Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body dynamics for the
protostars represented through sink particles. Our results show that central
massive objects with masses $\sim 10^4~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed by
accretion and collisions at different temperatures and that the most massive
object can reach efficiencies of $\sim 0.61$ for atomic cooling conditions and
$\sim 0.95$ for more unstable conditions. We observe a quasi-disk formation for
warmer temperatures and a higher contribution through collisions to the mass of
a central massive object. Our results show that the embedded cluster is in a
supercompetitive accretion regime in which it obtains mass by accretion that is
regulated by self-gravity. Our results suggest that in more unstable conditions
with lower gas temperatures, a more massive supermassive black hole seed can
form.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19908v1" target="_blank"><h2>Toward Unraveling Cyanopolyyne Surface Chemistry: A Preview on Isolated
  Systems From HC_{3}N to Ethyl Cyanide and Propylamine</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Marten T. Raaphorst, Joan Enrique-Romero, Thanja Lamberts</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> In press in ACS Earth and Space Chemistry, accepted 5 May 2025</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cyanopolyynes, a family of nitrogen containing carbon chains, are common in
the interstellar medium and possibly form the backbone of species relevant to
prebiotic chemistry. Following their gas phase formation, they are expected to
freeze out on ice grains in cold interstellar regions. In this work we present
the hydrogenation reaction network of isolated HC_{3}N, the smallest
cyanopolyyne, that consists over-a-barrier radical-neutral reactions and
barrierless radical-radical reactions. We employ density functional theory,
coupled cluster and multiconfigurational methods to obtain activation and
reaction energies for the hydrogenation network of HC_{3}N. This work explores
the reaction network of the isolated molecule and constitutes a preview on the
reactions occurring on the ice grain surface. We find that the reactions where
the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon chain at carbon atom opposite of the
cyano-group give the lowest and most narrow barriers. Subsequent hydrogenation
leads to the astrochemically relevant vinyl cyanide and ethyl cyanide.
Alternatively, the cyano-group can hydrogenate via radical-radical reactions,
leading to the fully saturated propylamine. These results can be extrapolated
to give insight into the general reactivity of carbon chains on interstellar
ices.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19832v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconciling extragalactic star formation efficiencies with theory:

formation (SF) efficiency per freefall time $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ from PHANGS
show little sign of theoretically predicted dependencies on cloud-scale virial
level or velocity dispersion. We explore ways to bring theory into consistency
with observations, highlighting systematic variations in internal density
structure that must happen together with an increase in virial level typical
towards galaxy centers. To introduce these variations into conventional
turbulence-regulated SF models we adopt three adjustments motivated by the host
galaxy's influence on the cloud-scale: we incorporate self-gravity and a gas
density distribution that contains a broad power-law (PL) component and
resembles the structure observed in local resolved clouds, we let the internal
gas kinematics include motion in the background potential and let this regulate
the onset of self-gravitation, and we assume that the gas density distribution
is in a steady-state for only a fraction of a freefall time. The combined
result is a strong reduction to $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ predicted in
multi-freefall (MFF) scenarios compared to purely lognormal probability density
functions and variations that are tied to the PL slope $\alpha$. The $\alpha$
needed to match PHANGS $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$'s vary systematically with
environment in the sense that gas sitting furthest from virial balance contains
more gas at high density. With this `galaxy regulation' behavior included, our
`self-gravitating' sgMFF models function similar to the original, roughly
`virialized cloud' single-freefall models. However, outside disks with their
characteristic regulation, the flexible MFF models may be better suited.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19583v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identifying lopsidedness in spiral galaxies using a Deep Convolutional
  Neural Network</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Biju Saha, Suman Sarkar, Arunima Banerjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> About 30\% of disk galaxies show lopsidedness in their stellar disk. Although
such a large-scale asymmetry in the disk can be primarily looked upon as a
long-lived mode ($m=1$), the physical origin of the lopsidedness in the disk
continues to be a puzzle. In this work, we develop an automated approach to
identify lopsided galaxies from the SDSS DR18 using a Deep Convolutional Neural
Network (DCNN) based on the publicly available AlexNet architecture. We select
nearly face-on spiral galaxies from SDSS DR18 with the Petrosian 90\% light
radius (\textit{petroR90\_i}) greater than $20^{''}$. Based on the visual
inspection, we choose 106 lopsided spiral galaxies and 105 symmetric spiral
galaxies, as our training set. Our trained model achieves a testing accuracy of
92.8\% at the end of 150 epochs. We then employ the trained model on a set of
813 face-on spiral galaxies from SDSS DR18 with $17^{''} \le petroR90\_i \le
20^{''} $ and identify 452 new lopsided spiral galaxies. We next investigate
the cosmic web environments in which the galaxies are located, using the
Hessian matrix of the density field. We find that 39\% of the lopsided galaxies
are located in sparser environments such as sheets and voids. This may provide
interesting clues towards understanding the origin of lopsidedness in isolated
galaxies, where distortion due to the tidal interactions is less frequent.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19960v1" target="_blank"><h2>Viability of general relativity and modified gravity cosmologies using

Hipólito-Ricaldi, Felipe Avila, Armando Bernui</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 9 figures. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Several models based on General Relativity and Modified Gravity aim to
reproduce the observed universe with precision comparable to the standard
flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. In this study, we investigate the consistency of some
of these models with current high-redshift cosmic data, assessing their ability
to simultaneously describe both the background expansion and matter clustering,
using measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the luminosity distance
$D_L(z)$, and the growth rate of structures $[f\sigma_8](z)$ through parametric
and non-parametric methods. Our results indicate that background observables
alone offer limited capacity to distinguish between models, while the inclusion
of growth of structures data proves useful in revealing deviations, even if
small. An $F(Q)$ model, the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM emerge as
alternatives well supported by data, closely matching the growth data and
showing performance comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, as revealed by the Akaike
Information Criterion. In contrast, $F(R)$ models are strongly disfavored
compared to $\Lambda$CDM and $F(Q)$. These analyses illustrate the usefulness
of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to explore the observational
viability of alternative cosmological models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19941v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing dipolar power asymmetry with galaxy clustering and intrinsic

through galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments (IA) in Stage IV galaxy
surveys. Specifically, we consider a dipolar modulation in the primordial power
spectrum and evaluate the Fisher information matrix using the two-point
statistics of both the galaxy clustering and IA. Our analysis reveals that
while IA alone provides limited improvement in constraining the anisotropy
amplitude, the cross-spectrum between galaxy density and IA can contribute up
to half the constraining power of galaxy clustering, especially for surveys
with low galaxy bias and high number density of galaxies, such as Euclid. This
demonstrates the potential of IA-clustering cross-correlations as a robust
consistency check against systematics, and highlights the complementary roles
of galaxy clustering and IA in constraining cosmic statistical anisotropy. We
also show that marginalizing over galaxy bias and IA bias parameters has a
negligible impact on the final constraint on the anisotropy amplitude.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19875v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of <3D> NLTE on GCE of oxygen with the RAdial Velocity Experiment</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  G. Guiglion</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar abundances, coupled with kinematics are a unique way to understand
the chemo-dynamical processes that occurred to build the Milky Way and its
local volume as we observe today. However, measuring abundances is challenging
as one needs to properly address the effect of departure from the Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), as well as the commonly used 1-dimensional
model atmosphere. In this work, we constrain the chemical evolution of [O/Fe]
in FG stars of the RAVE survey with [O/Fe] abundances derived in non-LTE (NLTE)
and with horizontally-temporally-averaged 3D (<3D>) model atmospheres. Using
standard spectral fitting method, we determine for the first time LTE and NLTE
[O/Fe] ratios from the O triplet at 8446A in turn-off and dwarf stars thanks to
intermediate-resolution RAVE spectra, assuming both 1D and <3D> model
atmosphere. NLTE effects play a significant role when determining oxygen even
at a resolution of R= 7500. Typical NLTE-LTE corrections of the order of -0.12
dex are measured in dwarfs and turn-off stars using 1D MARCS models. In
contrast to applying <3D> NLTE abundance corrections or the classical 1D LTE,
the full <3D> NLTE spectral fitting yields improving the precision of
abundances by nearly 10%. We show that the decrease of [O/Fe] in the
super-solar [Fe/H] regime is rather characterised by a flat trend when [O/Fe]
is computed in <3D> NLTE from full spectral fitting. We attribute this
flattening at super-solar [Fe/H] to the interplay between locally born stars
with negative [O/Fe] and stars migrated from the inner MW regions with
super-solar [O/Fe], supporting the complex chemo-dynamical history of the Solar
neighbourhood. Our results are key for understanding the effects of <3D> and
NLTE when measuring [O/Fe]. This work is a test bed for the analysis of 4MOST
low-resolution spectra that will share similar properties as RAVE in the red
wavelength domain.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19857v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes with Galactic Sources
  observed by LHAASO</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Xiu-hui Tan, Yu-feng Zhou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The recently identified \textit{memory burden} effect has the potential to
significantly decelerate the evaporation of black holes. Specifically, when
approximately half of a black hole's initial mass has been radiated away, the
evaporation process is halted. This mechanism allows very light primordial
black holes (PBHs) with masses $m_{\rm PBH}<10^{15}$ g to persist until the
present day and may contribute to the dark matter (DM) content of the universe.
In this work, we focus on PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g. Due to the
memory burden effect, these PBHs emit high-energy gamma-rays, which in turn
alter the corresponding observed energy spectra. To investigate the constraints
on the masses and DM abundance of PBHs, we analyze data from four Galactic
sources measured by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO),
including the Crab Nebula, LHAASO J2226+6057, LHAASO J1908+0621, and LHAASO
J1825-1326. Our findings indicate that the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray spectra
from these Galactic sources provide crucial probes for light PBHs, thereby
significantly constraining their potential contribution to DM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20165v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the Sagittarius stream with RR Lyrae Stars from Gaia Data
  Release 3</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tatiana Muraveva, Michele Bellazzini, Alessia Garofalo, Gisella Clementini, Lorenzo Monti, Maria Letizia Valentini</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics; 16 pages, 15 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy is one of the most prominent
satellites of the Milky Way (MW). It is currently undergoing tidal disruption,
forming an extensive stellar stream that provides key insights into the
assembly history of the MW halo. In this study we analyzed RR Lyrae stars
(RRLs) in the Sgr stream provided in Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), for which new
estimates of photometric metallicities are available in the literature, and
accurate distances were calculated using the reddening-free
period-Wesenheit-metallicity ($PWZ$) relation. We determine the mean
metallicity of RRLs in the Sgr stream to be ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.62 \pm 0.01$ dex.
We measure a metallicity gradient as a function of stripping time from the Sgr
progenitor of $0.05 \pm 0.02$ dex/Gyr, indicating that the metal-poor RRLs were
stripped earlier during the accretion process. The far arm is found to be the
most metal-poor structure of the Sgr stream, with a mean metallicity of ${\rm
[Fe/H]}=-1.98 \pm 0.37$ dex, significantly lower than that of the leading
($-1.69\pm0.31$ dex) and trailing ($-1.64 \pm 0.28$ dex) arms. Our findings
show that the RRLs in the far arm of the Sgr stream exhibit a bimodal
metallicity distribution with peaks at [Fe/H]=$-2.4$ dex and $-1.7$ dex. The
main body of the stream is the most metal-rich structure, with a mean
metallicity of ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.58 \pm 0.31$ dex and a radial gradient of
$-0.008 \pm 0.005$ dex/kpc. We find almost negligible metallicity gradients of
$(-0.2 \pm 0.3)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the trailing arm and $(-1.0 \pm
0.5)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the leading arm, in agreement with previous
studies. Finally, we investigate the bifurcation of the Sgr stream and conclude
that the metallicity difference between the faint and bright branches is not
confirmed based on the RRLs in our sample.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20193v1" target="_blank"><h2>A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Thomas Montandon, Elsa M. Teixeira, Adèle Poudou, Vivian Poulin</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend
the Lambda-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models
predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact
structure formation. In particular, a model in which DM decays at a rate
$\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a
low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better
agreement with that measured by some past weak lensing surveys. Bayesian
analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a
reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value.
In this paper, we perform a frequentist analysis of Planck+BAO data. We find
$1\sigma$ constraints on the half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a
velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$km/s which differ from their Bayesian
counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effects. Moreover, we find that
under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$,
in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $1.5\sigma$. We
further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to
exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the
primordial parameters $A_s$ and $n_s$. When those are removed from the
analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is
only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000
analysis that one can constrain the model. We further highlight that in the
absence of such priors, the region of scales best-measured by KiDS-1000 does
not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, but rather a slightly smaller range of
scales centered around $k\sim 0.3\, h/$Mpc. One must thus be careful in
applying $S_8$ constraints to a model instead of the full data likelihood.</p></br></body>
