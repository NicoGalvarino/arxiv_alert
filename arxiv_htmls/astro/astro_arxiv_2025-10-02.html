cosmology at high redshifts $(2.3 < z < 3.5)$, relying on abundant galaxy
tracers such as Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs).
Medium-band photometry has emerged as a potential technique for efficiently
selecting these high-redshift galaxies. In this work, we present clustering
analysis of medium-band selected galaxies at high redshift, utilizing
photometric data from the Intermediate Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) and
spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We
interpret the clustering of such samples using both Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) modeling and a perturbation theory description of
large-scale structure. Our modeling indicates that the current target sample is
composed from an overlapping mixture of LAEs and LBGs with emission lines.
Despite differences in target selection, we find that the clustering properties
are consistent with previous studies, with correlation lengths $r_0\simeq
3-4\,h^{-1}$Mpc and a linear bias of $b\sim1.8-2.5$. Finally, we discuss the
simulation requirements implied by these measurements and demonstrate that the
properties of the samples would make them excellent targets to enhance our
understanding of the high-$z$ universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26591v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JWST EXCELS Survey: A spectroscopic investigation of the ionizing

the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies
(SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations.
Using a sample of $N=159$ SFGs at $1 < z < 8$, observed with deep medium-resolution
spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical
analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_\rm{ion}$). We
consider $\xi_\rm{ion}$, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to
a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths
($W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ and $W_\lambda$( [OIII])), UV luminosity
($M_\rm{UV}$) and UV slope ($\beta_\rm{UV}$), as well as dust attenuation
($E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression
methodology, we fit $\xi_\rm{ion}$ against the principal observables while
fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the
impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations
between $\xi_\rm{ion}$ and $ W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$, $W_\lambda$([OIII]) and
$\beta_\rm{UV}$ are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with $M_\rm{UV}$ and
redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies.
Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that
$W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ or $W_\lambda$([OIII]), along with $\beta_\rm{UV}$
and $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$, are the most important observables for accurately
predicting $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$. The latter identifies the most common outliers as
SFGs with relatively high $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}\gtrsim0.5$, possibly indicative of
obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these
properties enable $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$ to be inferred with an accuracy of
$\sim0.15\,$dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of
$\sigma_\rm{int}\sim0.035\,$dex.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25893v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bayesian Gaussian Methods for Robust Background Modeling in CALorimetric

CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background
modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged
pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect
correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background
uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to
reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a
novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process
(GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated
structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and
propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper
limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and
simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak
short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional
polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more
physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable,
real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches. All

epochs, leading to variations in the formation time which represents the time
elapsed from the onset of structure formation until the formation time of a
particular object. In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and
constrain the galaxy formation time $t_f(z)$ using non-parametric
reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance
Symbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive
galaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two
different values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck
Collaborations. When adopting the $\Lambda$CDM model and the GP
reconstructions, we find $\left< t_f \right > =0.72_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES)
and $\left< t_f \right > = 1.26_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a
specific cosmological model, we obtain $\left < t_f \right > = 0.71 \pm {0.19}$ Gyr
(SH0ES) and $\left < t_f \right > = 1.35_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar
values are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR)
indicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t_f(z)$. The
results also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and
Planck values, highlighting the impact of the $H_0$ tension on the cosmological
estimates of $t_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the
analysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of
our results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different
evolutionary timescales and that $t_f$ is not constant, with noticeable
variations at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.5$).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26446v1" target="_blank"><h2>Is the Peculiar Galactic Center Transient Swift J174610.4-290018 A

discovered by the Swift satellite in February 2024 at the onset of its
outburst, recently attracted intentional or coincident follow-up X-ray
observations using Swift, NuSTAR and Chandra. We have performed a comprehensive
analysis of the relevant X-ray data to investigate the spectral and temporal
properties of this source between October 2000 and July 2024. Archival Chandra
data reveal a plausible additional outburst in 2005, followed by a quiescent
state in the next $\sim$19 years. The X-ray spectra in both the quiescent and
outburst phases are consistent with a thermal plasma spectrum with relatively
high temperatures ($\sim$10 keV) and prominent emission lines from both neutral
and highly-ionized iron. A previously proposed low-mass X-ray binary/accretion
disk corona scenario for Swift J174610, based on XRISM observations near the
peak of the 2024 outburst, is examined against the newly derived X-ray
properties and is disfavored, in particular due to its difficulty in explaining
the quiescent state spectrum. Instead, we suggest a symbiotic binary/recurrent
nova scenario, which gains support from many of the observed X-ray properties
of Swift J174610 and a close comparison with the famous Galactic recurrent nova
RS Oph. If confirmed, Swift J174610 would represent the first nova detected in
the Galactic center, offering new insights into the otherwise elusive
population of massive white dwarfs as well as wide binaries in the close
vicinity of Sgr A*. Our findings call for multi-wavelength follow-up
observations for this highly unusual X-ray source.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25784v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hector Galaxy Survey: Data Processing, Quality Control and Early Science</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S.

survey currently using the AAT to observe up to 15,000 galaxies at low redshift
($z < 0.1$). The Hector instrument employs 21 optical fibre bundles feeding
into two double-beam spectrographs to enable wide-field multi-object IFS
observations of galaxies. To efficiently process the survey data, we adopt the
data reduction pipeline developed for the SAMI Galaxy Survey, with significant
updates to accommodate Hector's dual-spectrograph system. These enhancements
address key differences in spectral resolution and other instrumental
characteristics relative to SAMI, and are specifically optimised for Hector's
unique configuration. We introduce a two-dimensional arc fitting approach that
reduces the RMS velocity scatter by a factor of 1.2--3.4 compared to fitting
arc lines independently for each fibre. The pipeline also incorporates detailed
modelling of chromatic optical distortion in the wide-field corrector, to
account for wavelength-dependent spatial shifts across the focal plane. We
assess data quality through a series of validation tests, including wavelength
solution accuracy, spectral resolution, throughput characterisation,
astrometric precision, sky subtraction residuals, and flux calibration
stability (4\% systematic offset when compared to Legacy Survey fluxes). We
demonstrate that Hector delivers high-fidelity, science-ready datasets,
supporting robust measurements of galaxy kinematics, stellar populations, and
emission-line properties, and provide examples. Additionally, we address
systematic uncertainties identified during the data processing and propose
future improvements to enhance the precision and reliability of upcoming data
releases. This work establishes a robust data reduction framework for Hector,

the accretion-disc-corona (ADC) neutron-star system 2S 0921-630 (=V395 Car)
observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The PD increases
with energy, while the polarization angle (PA) varies significantly across the
band. These trends are consistent with a high-inclination ADC geometry where
the vertically extended disc blocks direct sight of the central X-ray source,
and the observed X-rays are those scattered in an equatorial disc wind. We also
find tentative PD variability in the 2--3 keV band. To interpret the
time-averaged polarization, we build spectropolarimetric models by Monte Carlo
radiation transfer simulation with column density distribution of
thermal-radiative wind launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc under an
axisymmetric geometry. The model combines boundary-layer emission, its disc
reflection, and the disc continuum, each with its intrinsic polarization.
Scattering of this composite spectrum in the wind reproduces both the observed
PD and its increase with energy. However, the observed PA evolution is not
captured, which may indicate departures from axisymmetry--e.g. misalignment
between the inner disc (and/or neutron-star spin) and the outer disc/wind, or a
weak disc warping.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25832v1" target="_blank"><h2>FIELDMAPS Data Release: Far-Infrared Polarization in the "Bones" of the

have found a close correspondence between the orientation of spiral arms and
magnetic field lines on scales of hundreds of parsecs. This paper presents
polarization measurements at 214 $\mu$m toward ten filamentary candidate
``bones" in the Milky Way using the High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera
(HAWC+) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). These
data were taken as part of the Filaments Extremely Long and Dark: A Magnetic

magnetic field in spiral arms at parsec scales. We describe the complex yet
well-defined polarization structure of all ten candidate bones, and we find a
mean difference and standard deviation of $-74^{\circ} \pm 32^{\circ}$ between
their filament axis and the plane-of-sky magnetic field, closer to a field
perpendicular to their length rather than parallel. By contrast, the 850 $\mu$m
polarization data from \textit{Planck} on scales greater than 10 pc show a
nearly parallel mean difference of $3^{\circ} \pm 21^{\circ}$. These findings
provide further evidence that magnetic fields can change orientation at the
scale of dense molecular clouds, even along spiral arms. Finally, we use a
power law to fit the dust polarization fraction as a function of total

with a mean and standard deviation of $-0.7 \pm 0.1$. The polarization, dust

energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of
dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers
the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark
energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6
parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and
additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the
lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$),
the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm
eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive
constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck
Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the
Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing
(WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and
CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} >1$, indicating a
higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of
unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic
quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE),
one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing

lenses in the time domain, offers a promising and independent method for
measuring cosmological distances. However, in addition to the main deflector
that produces the multiple images, the large-scale structure along the
line-of-sight (LoS) will also deflect the traveling light rays, known as weak
lensing (WL). Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on
arcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS
effects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more
straightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more
realistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally
cheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique,
which is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale,
extending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale.
We focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1.
In addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a
region approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers,
inducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2. These
fluctuations cannot be fully accounted for by external shear alone,
necessitating the inclusion of external flexion; 3. While incorporating flexion
provides a reasonably good fit to the lensing image, the time-delay distance
still exhibits a $6.2$\textperthousand~bias and a $2.5\%$ uncertainty. This
underscores the limitations of the single-plane approximation, as time-delay
errors accumulate along the LoS.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25886v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatial distribution of secondary electrons' Synchrotron emission:

non-thermal X-ray spectra of these sources, which could originate from primary

between these scenarios. In this work, we investigate the morphology of the
X-ray emission from secondary electrons/positrons. By calculating the surface
brightness profile and the photon index profile of X-ray emission, we find that
secondary electrons produce a distinctively flat X-ray surface brightness
profile. Our results suggest that, in addition to the X-ray spectrum, the X-ray

shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model
over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We
investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric
information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and
combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter,
$\Omega_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the
lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the
$\sigma_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time
geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The
preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings:
when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is
preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the
result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z < 0.1$ SN data in
the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a
statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed,
the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy
in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance
of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We
show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide
comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes
provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26081v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II.

anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered
on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order,
their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to
derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual
density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not
collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing
mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM
growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise
mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results
