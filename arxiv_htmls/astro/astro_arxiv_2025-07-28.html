  and a Triple-Peaked AGN</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Megan R. Sturm, Amy E.

(BH) scaling relations to better understand the formation and growth mechanisms
of central supermassive BHs. We target six galaxies that have been previously
identified as hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on optical
spectroscopy from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey or the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with stellar masses reported to be M$_\star < 5
\times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. Using follow-up optical spectroscopy from the Magellan
Echellette Spectrograph (MagE), we extract galaxy velocity dispersions
($\sigma_\star$) and estimate virial BH masses from broad H$\alpha$ emission.
We find that the galaxies in our sample do not deviate significantly from
either the M$_{BH}-\sigma_\star$ or M$_{BH}-$M$_{\star}$ scaling relations
defined by higher mass galaxies. Additionally, we identify one galaxy with
triple-peaked SII, NII, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. This spectral
shape is not shared by OIII and, in fact, the OIII line appears to have
distinct kinematics from the other emission lines. Incorporating the spatial
distribution of the various emission lines, we find that the galaxy spectrum is
consistent with a prominent central AGN driving an outflow, surrounded by an
extended ring/disk of gas predominantly ionized by shocks and/or star
formation. This work has implications for the demographics of BHs in low-mass
galaxies and the role of AGN feedback.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18712v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), CGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources
accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration
region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes
observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot
propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy
(~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before
losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray
energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will
appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In
lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as
hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray
observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton
injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray
surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been
overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC
contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight
correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power,
because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source.
Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$
kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears
to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that
X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs,
potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV
(super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We
also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in
clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19130v1" target="_blank"><h2>Emulating redshift-mixing due to blending in weak gravitational lensing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zekang Zhang, Daniel Gruen, Luca Tortorelli, Shun-Sheng Li, Jamie McCullough</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies whose images overlap in the focal plane of a telescope, commonly
referred to as blends, are often located at different redshifts. Blending
introduces a challenge to weak lensing cosmology probes, as such blends are
subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described
by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift
distribution, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes
of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we
propose a novel method to correct $n_{\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending
by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we
design a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in
which we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to
shear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the
feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the
robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy
population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the
high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when
not modelling the effect. Given appropriately processed image simulations, our
correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses
to mitigate this source of systematic error.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19350v1" target="_blank"><h2>GATOS. n.

parsecs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty
winds driven away by radiation pressure. However, the physical characterization
of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine $10-21\mu$m
JWST/MIRI imaging observations with $7-25 \mu$m MRS integral field
spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, $\bar{D}=35.4\pm4.6$~Mpc, AGN from the
GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at $\sim75$ pc
resolution at $21~\mu$m. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities,
$\log_{10}(\bar{L}_{\rm{bol}}~[\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}])=44.0\pm0.3$, span a wide
range of optical outflow rates, $\dot{M}=0.003-0.21$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
column densities, $\log_{10}(N_{H}^{X-ray} [cm^{-2}])=22.2-24.3$, and Eddington
ratios, $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}=0.005-0.06$. We find a poor correlation between the
line-only and continuum-only images, indicating that the extended MIR continuum
emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with
narrow emission lines in the $10-15\,\mu$m wavelength range. The $75-450$~pc
continuum emission has constant dust temperature, $T_{\rm{d}}=132^{+7}_{-7}$ K,
and mass, $M_{\rm{d}}=728^{+29}_{-27}$ M$_{\odot}$. Using the conditions of
energy balance between radiation pressure and gravity, we find that our AGN
sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime, consistent with the lack of
detection of dusty winds in our observations. At $10~\mu$m, the level of line
emission contribution across the NLR is correlated with the outflow kinetic
energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties.
These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and
line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular
clouds and/or shocked regions across the narrow line region.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19472v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST+ALMA reveal the build up of stellar mass in the cores of dusty

evolutionary bridge between the star-forming and quiescent phases of massive
galaxy evolution. With the combined power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible
to use high resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR), and
rest-submm wavelengths to study the multi-wavelength morphologies tracing both
the stellar populations and dust within this key phase. We present the joint
analysis of JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by ALMA
for a sample of 33 galaxies at $z$=1.5 to $z$=5.5 selected from the 1.1mm
GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the morphologies of this population to mass
and redshift selected samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The
1.1mm-selected sample are morphologically distinct from other similarly massive
star-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-wavelength gradient from
1.5-4.4$\mu$m, with a more dramatic decrease in size towards longer
wavelengths. While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the
1.1mm-selected galaxies are brighter in the inner regions relative to the field
star-forming population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent
population. These morphological differences could suggest that dusty
star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming galaxies, have already
built up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading to extended and
clumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in
the rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already established,
we speculate that mm-selected galaxies may imminently evolve to join their
quiescent descendants.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18823v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: The Diverse Carbon

galaxies contain a wealth of information about conditions in their cold
interstellar gas. Here we use galaxy-scale observations of the three lowest
energy CO lines to determine SLEDs and line ratios in a sample of 47 nearby,
predominantly star forming galaxies. We find systematic trend of higher gas
excitation with increasing star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density
($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), with the range of variations being even larger than
predicted by simulations. Power law fits of the CO line ratios as a function of
SFR and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ provide a good description of the trends seen in our
sample and also accurately predict values for a wide range of galaxy types
compiled from the literature. Based on these fits, we provide prescriptions for
estimating CO(1-0) luminosities and molecular gas masses using CO(3-2) or
CO(2-1) in cases where CO(1-0) is not observed directly. We compare our
observed SLEDs with molecular cloud models in order to examine how the physical
properties of cold gas vary across the galaxy population. We find that gas
conditions in star forming and starburst galaxies lie on a continuum with
increasing gas density in more actively star forming systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19357v1" target="_blank"><h2>NGC 6860, Mrk 915 and MCG -01-24-012. I. Spatial anti-correlation

in three nearby Seyfert galaxies: NGC 6860, Mrk 915 and MCG -01-24-012. To
constrain the cold molecular flux distribution at $\sim$ 0.5 -
0.8$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$ 150 - 400 pc) scales, we used data from the
CO(2-1) emission line, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). For the ionized gas, we used Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
narrow-band images, centered on the [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission
lines. Within the inner kiloparsec of the three galaxies, we observe gaps in
the CO emission in regions co-spatial with the [O III] flux distribution,
similarly to what has been recently observed in other active galaxies. From our
original sample of 13 nearby AGN sources, 12 objects present the same trend.
This indicates that CO molecules might be partially dissociated by AGN
radiation or that there is a deficit of cold molecular gas on nuclear scales
driven by ionized gas outflows/jets. If so, this represents a form of AGN
feedback that is not captured when only outflow kinematics properties, such as
mass outflow rates, are considered. We also discuss that part of the molecular

systems consisting of neutral and/or ionized gas moving at high velocities
relative to the rotation of the disk. In this work, we investigate Milky
Way-like galaxies from the TNG50 simulation to characterize the properties,
morphology, and accretion rates of the warm and hot ionized material comoving
with neutral HVCs visible in HI. We find that the ionized gas forms an envelope
around the neutral material, and in most cases (73% of the HVCs) it is prolate
in morphology. We also find that the ionized mass is ~6 times greater than the
neutral mass, which leads to significantly more accretion possible from the
ionized gas ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$) than the neutral gas
($\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$), consistent with estimates made from observations of
our own Galaxy. We investigate the accretion rates from both phases of HVCs
around 47 Milky Way-like galaxies and find that $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ scales
with $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$, and both scale with the star formation rate of
the galaxy. Finally, we find that, on average, $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ could
account for 81% of the galactic star formation rate (assuming the material can
sufficiently cool and condense), while $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$ can only balance
11%. Thus, the diffuse, ionized, high-velocity circumgalactic medium plays a
defining role in the evolution and growth of galaxies at low redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18688v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mapping water ice with infrared broadband photometry</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Stefan Meingast</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics on July 24, 2025</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Interstellar ices play a fundamental role in the physical and chemical
evolution of molecular clouds and star-forming regions, yet their large-scale

the ice color excess method, which parametrizes the peak optical depth
($\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$) of the prominent 3$\mu$m absorption feature,
which is predominantly caused by the presence of solid H$_2$O. The method
builds on well-established near-infrared color excess techniques and uses
widely available infrared broadband photometry. Through detailed evaluation of
passband combinations and a comprehensive error analysis, I construct the ice
color excess metric $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This parameter emerges as the optimal
choice that minimizes systematic errors while leveraging high-quality, widely
available photometry from Spitzer and WISE data archives. To calibrate the
method, I compile from the literature a sample of stars located in the
background of nearby molecular clouds, for which spectroscopically measured
optical depths are available. The empirical calibration yields a remarkably
tight correlation between $\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$.
This photometric technique opens a new avenue for tracing the icy component of
the interstellar medium on Galactic scales, providing a powerful complement to
spectroscopic surveys and enabling new insights into the environmental

integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution $\rm R\simeq 30-300$),
covering the spectral range $0.8-5.3~\mu m$, reveals a pronounced $\rm

it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state.
Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens pc scales shows relatively uniform
features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with
physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the

five observed star clusters exhibit ages of $\rm 7-30~Myr$. An updated lens
model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming
they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local
star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent
with star clusters ($\lesssim10$ pc) are identified along the extended tail of

Cosmic Gems has raised the question about the formation mechanism of star
clusters in the first half Gyr after the Big-Bang. We infer the total stellar
mass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass
function (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\beta$), assuming three different slopes
$\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$
and $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the
stellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides
the best, modestly magnified ($\mu$ = 1.84$\pm$0.05) representation of the
entire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated
as 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff =
103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\Sigma$mass =
520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties
- including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified
SCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency
(approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the
relatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the
counter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating
the physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent
past (<~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star
formation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the
``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ < -20). Our study provides insights into the
extreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light
into the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as
globular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18912v1" target="_blank"><h2>The coherent satellite velocity field around the interacting spiral

the understanding of the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation
processes. We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the
emission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of
the Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from "Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds
with NOEMA" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and
HCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk
molecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the
center, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and
HNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across
the environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular
gas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and
radius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these
scales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the
inner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when
removing the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud
density, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While
ratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface
density of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby
star-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51
that are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased
ionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few
kpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed
mechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission
at larger-scale environments and cloud scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19480v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracers of the ionization fraction in dense and translucent molecular

crucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep
knowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such
as those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable
only in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\mathrm{e}$ over
large areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical
models. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace
$f_\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this
study, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the
ionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense
and translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the
far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the
ionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and
$10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to
$G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume
density ($f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\mathrm{e} \propto
n^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas,
differing line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of
electron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the
CN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and
C$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments,
CCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in
translucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense
gas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19281v1" target="_blank"><h2>Magnetic field of a ring-like shape molecular cloud</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dana Alina, Adel Umirbayeva, Yasuo Doi, Soichiro Jo, Yue Hu, Alex Lazarian, Janik Karoly, Tie Liu, Koji S.

between magnetic fields and external forces is crucial in shaping and

dimension $D_2$ curve, a cumulative statistic derived from the two-point
correlation function. Unlike traditional 3D approaches, angular $D_2$ is
inherently less sensitive to nonlinear dynamical distortions, such as the
small-scale Finger-of-God (FoG) effect. Using both MultiDark-Patchy and EZmock
galaxy catalogs, we assess the scale-dependent impact of redshift-space
distortions on $D_2$ and bias measurements. We demonstrate that the systematic
errors associated with FoG modeling can be significantly reduced by restricting
the analysis to appropriate minimum comoving angular scales of $\sim
1.25^{\circ} $, which corresponds to comoving scales of $\sim
20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Since the
observational estimative of $D_2(\theta)$ is not dependent on a cosmological
model we obtain robust estimates of the galaxy bias and place competitive
constraints on the physical matter density $\omega_m$. By applying this
framework to SDSS DR12 and DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy data, we obtain $\omega_m =
0.142^{+0.014}_{-0.022}$ (1$\sigma$), which agrees with current CMB analyses.
Our results highlight the potential of the angular $D_2$ curve as a

matter distribution around lens galaxies -- i.e., the galaxy bias relation.
Properly accounting for the spin-2 nature of weak lensing distortions, we
develop a quadratic estimator for measuring the $E$- and $B$-mode angular power
spectra from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, correcting for survey window effects
arising from, for example, survey geometry and bright star masks. The estimator
can be implemented efficiently by adopting FFTs on pixelized maps of the lens
galaxy distribution and source galaxy ellipticities, under the flat-sky
approximation. Using simulated weak lensing fields and halo catalogs in the
light-cone ray-tracing simulations, we show that the estimator can recover the
underlying $E$-mode power spectrum, $C_{{\rm g}E}(\ell)$, to within a few
percent in fractional error, while minimizing the leakage of $E$-mode into the
$B$-mode power spectrum, in each multipole bin over the wide range of
multipoles (up to $\ell \sim 3000$ studied in this paper). We then discuss that
the estimator can be used to estimate the 3D galaxy-matter power spectrum,
$P_{\rm gm}(k)$, by dividing lens galaxies into multiple redshift slices. We
also derive an optimal weighting for each lens redshift slice in the shot
noise-limited regime for the estimation of $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, which reduces the
statistical errors by up to $\sim$20\% compared to the case without weighting.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18142v2" target="_blank"><h2>Optimising the sample selection for photometric galaxy surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Marc Alemany-Gotor, Isaac Tutusaus, Pablo Fosalba</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Determining cosmological parameters with high precision, as well as resolving
current tensions in their values derived from low and high redshift probes, is
one of the main objectives of the new generation of cosmological surveys. The
combination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and
systematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this
context, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that
combines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the
so-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an
efficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for
3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main
steps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric
redshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV
surveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows
us to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype
clustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak
lensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores
multiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the
fiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic
configurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using
this method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different
numbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for
stage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the
figure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of
$\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\sim$4 for
non-optimal photometric survey analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19450v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Neel Shah, Kazuya Koyama, Johannes Noller</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages + appendices and references, 23 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark

identified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently
catalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical
nature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build
colour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also
performed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture
model techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams
similarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI
data sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real
clusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density
variations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition
to other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in
a limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced
the possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age

expected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the

against the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation
on the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18054v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variational autoencoder for generating realistic $N$-body simulations

accurate reconstruction and generation of statistically realistic samples. We

agreement with the state-of-the-art simulations. In addition, the VAE provides
a fast and scalable method for generating synthetic cosmological data, making
it a valuable tool for data augmentation. These capabilities can accelerate the
development and training of more advanced machine learning models for

scalar spectral index, with $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which sets tighter
constraints on inflationary models, and these shifts are not in favor of many
pre existing scenarios, including the widely studied and accepted standard
Starobinsky model. In this paper, we examine the fractional power scalar
potential within the framework of Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity,
incorporating standard slow roll approximation. The EGB theory, motivated by
higher dimensional models, introduces quadratic curvature corrections and a
coupling between the scalar field and the Gauss Bonnet term, thereby modifying
the cosmological dynamics. The results show good agreement with observational
data, placing the predictions within the $1 \sigma$ region of the ACT $r-n_s$
constraint plot. Furthermore, incorporating the running of the scalar spectral
index reinforces the models consistency with observational bounds. We also
explore the parameter space of the EGB couplings and identify the range of free
parameters for which the results of $n_s$ and $r$ values remain within the $1

controversial topic regarding galaxy dynamics. Numerical simulations show that
these phenomena strongly depend on physical and numerical parameters. In this
work, we study the combined influence of the softening parameter, $\epsilon$
and disc mass fraction, $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ on the formation and evolution of bars
in isolated disc-halo models via $N$-body simulations with different particle
resolutions. Previous studies indicate that the bar strength depends on
$m_{\mathrm{d}}$ as $\propto m_{\mathrm{d}}^{-1}$, which is seen as a delay in
bar formation. However, the distorsion parameter, $\eta$, which measures the
bar's momentum through time, shows that an increase in $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ does
not always induce a delay in bar formation. This suggests that $\epsilon$
interact to either enhance or weaken the bar. Moreover, numerical heating
dominates in models with small softening values, creating highly accelerated
particles at the centre of discs, regardless of $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ or resolution.
These enhanced particle accelerations produce chaotic orbits for $\epsilon \leq
5\,$pc, resulting in bar suppression due to collisional dynamics in the centre.
In our high resolution models ($N \approx 10^{7}$), small softening values are
incapable of reproducing the bar instability. The role of disc mass is as
follows: increasing $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ for moderate $\epsilon$ ($\geq 10\,$pc)
reduces the amount of drift in the acceleration profile, without affecting the
bar's behaviour. Models with lower $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ values coupled with small
softening values, have an excess of highly accelerated particles, introducing
unwanted effects into otherwise reliable simulations. Finally, we show that the
evolution of the disc's vertical acceleration profile is a reliable indicator
of numerical heating introduced by $\epsilon$ and the bar.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18162v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synchrotron-limited Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Shearing Flows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Frank M.

Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasi-classical Boltzmann transport calculation
of the dark matter production, we compute the non-thermal phase space
distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$
and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the
resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit
the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer
functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal
WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing

statistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been
adopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To
address this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling
uncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic
electron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such
as FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter
selections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of
uncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as
reliable cosmological tools.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18312v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black hole formation in matter domination</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ehsan Ebrahimian, Ali Akbar Abolhasani, Mehrdad Mirbabayi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> cosmic abundance (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare
primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The
collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as
they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat
perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the
growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the
initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$.
Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic
cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th}
\sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim
10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales.
Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than
Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be
$a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed
in Radiation Domination.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18274v1" target="_blank"><h2>Phantom crossing or dark interaction?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sêcloka L.

Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}<-1$)
in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$
parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to
fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we
investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but
effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and
non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing
quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm
de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state
of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the
effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of
state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A
nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The
energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at
later times.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18347v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PyKOALA python library: a multi-instrument package for IFS data

Persic, R. Rando, Y. Rephaeli</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> A&A, accepted; 13 pages, 2 appendices, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Diffuse non-thermal (NT) emission from the central starburst (CSB) of M82 has
been measured at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Far-infrared (FIR),
radio, and X-ray emission maps are mutually consistent, with radio and X-ray
emissions spectrally similar - suggesting the latter to be Compton/FIR
radiation. We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements,
which - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest,
most extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT
radio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR).
Key features of our models are the identification of the >50 GeV emission as
pionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum.
This enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and
secondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR
and magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR,
and use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB
region - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody.
Our SED modeling indicates that 1) the >10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2)
the 0.1 < E/GeV < 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight
(and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the <0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic,
and 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at
comparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and
a curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp
spectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200
1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the
magnetic field is B = 120 uG. The derived CR and B energy densities are in
equipartition.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18188v1" target="_blank"><h2>Updated constraints on modified gravity from binary pulsars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S.

(GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative
theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a
time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar
gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars,
namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the
Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital
dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian
parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do
this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python
pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different
binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and
the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars
(PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times
10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint
on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times
10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide
updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we
find that our results are consistent with GR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19166v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Cheng Cheng, Panagiotis Giannadakis, Lucien Heurtier, Eugene A.

kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the
kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations
using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar
perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we
are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings
show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains
valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much
richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black
hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this
process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the
post-inflationary era.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18955v1" target="_blank"><h2>A New Framework to Detect Multi-Messenger Signals from Bright Sporadic

(GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to
identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection
in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline,
\textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM
counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled
sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an
observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to
discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We
demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm
rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards
advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our
understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the
high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as
neutrinos in the future.</p></br></body>
