(IGM) have strong implications on galaxy formation and evolution models. The
ionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the
mechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be
too weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM
metallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We
exploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF)
and applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N
UVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z~3). We also "deabsorbed" the
strongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM
signal. For each test, we generated 1000 mock spectra with shuffled line
positions to derive an estimate for the TPCF noise level. The TPCF shows a
clear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but
when deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines
associated with logN(HI)>14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\sigma$,
although 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional
weak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)<14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a
significant CIV peak. Eventually, when we create a synthetic spectrum with
gaussian distributed noise and same S/N as the complete spectrum, we remove the
signal caused by the spectral intrinsic features and thus find a peak
compatible with a metallicity of -3.80<[C/H]<-3.50. We conclude that the TPCF
method is not sensitive to the presence of the weakest systems in the real
spectrum, despite the extremely high S/N and high resolution of the data.
However, the results of this statistical technique would possibly change when
combining more than one line of sight.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26884v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the AGN tori at cosmic noon using high-resolution JWST

Rosario, Matthaios Charidis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 21 pages (27 including appendix and bibliography), 13 figures (15 including figures in appendix)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), dust (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> There is evidence for significant evolution in the gaseous and dust
properties of galaxies since the era of cosmic noon ($1\lesssim z\lesssim
2.5$). The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host
galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and
large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) is the "torus", a dense, dusty structure that acts as the
interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The
transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for
evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging
from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in
unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at $z\sim2$. We employ a novel
SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band
photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST
photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion
disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate
that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter
constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the
Covering Fraction ($CF$) distribution peaks at $\approx0.25$ with a long tail
towards higher $CF$. Despite the well-known evolution of the ISM and structural
properties of AGN hosts to these redshifts, the $CF$ distribution of our sample
does not show any strong statistical difference with that found in local AGN of
equivalent luminosity, or with those at intermediate redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26881v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shooting for the stars: Jet-mode feedback and AGN jet deceleration from

Accepted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), feedback (title, abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> AGN jets are thought to be vital ingredients in galaxy evolution through the
action of kinetic feedback; however, how narrow, relativistic outflows couple
to galaxies remains an open question. Jet deceleration, which is often
attributed to the entrainment of material, such as stellar winds, is thought to
be necessary for efficient coupling. We present a simple model of jet
deceleration due to stellar mass-loading to investigate the energy budget of
direct jet feedback in the local Universe. To this end, we produce models of
stellar mass-loss, including deriving a prescription for main sequence
mass-loss rates as a function of stellar population age. We pair this mass-loss
data with a parametric fit for radio AGN incidence, predicting that a majority
of jets are decelerated within their hosts, and generally replicate the
expected FR-II fraction in LERGs. We calculate that $\gtrsim$25\% of the jet
power in the local Universe is efficiently decelerated and available for direct
feedback within galaxies for any stellar population age. This fraction is
largely invariant to the shape of the radio AGN incidence function at low jet
Eddington fractions. The stellar mass-loss rate evolves significantly over
time, approximately following $\tau^{-1.1}$, leading to corresponding decreases
in decelerated jet power in older stellar populations. Although asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars dominate mass-loss at all ages, we find that their
stochasticity is important in low-mass galaxies, and derive a critical jet
power below which main sequence stars alone are sufficient to decelerate the
jet.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26885v1" target="_blank"><h2>High$-z$ [OI] emission lines: ColdSIM simulations and ALMA observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Massimiliano Parente, Manuela Bischetti, Umberto Maio, Francesco Salvestrini, Chiara Feruglio, Gian Luigi Granato, Cinthia Ragone-Figueroa, Roberta Tripodi, Carlos De Breuck, Carl Ferkinhoff, Luca Tornatore</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 14 figures - accepted in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (title, abstract), molecular gas (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Neutral-oxygen [OI] far-infrared emission lines at $63\mu$m and $145\mu$m are
powerful probes of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium, although
they have not been fully exploited in high-redshift studies. We investigate the
connection between [OI] emission lines and key galaxy properties, such as star
formation rate (SFR) and H$_2$ content. Our predictions are compared with
existing observations and new data analysed in this work. We post-process the
outputs of the ColdSIM cosmological simulations with the DESPOTIC model, taking
into account [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption by cold foreground material. A Random
Forest algorithm is employed to accelerate computations and new observational
ALMA data for galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 5-7$ are used to validate our
model. Our predictions show significant [OI]$63\mu$m luminosities ($\approx
10^8\,\rm L_\odot$) for galaxies with SFRs of $\approx 10^2\,\rm M_\odot\,{\rm

one and is a factor $\approx 2-20$ below high-$z$ observations. Both [OI] lines
correlate with SFR and molecular mass, but exhibit flattening in scaling
relations with metallicity and stellar mass. Foreground self-absorption reduces
the [OI] flux by a factor of $2-4$, consistent with empirical corrections in
observational studies. We find typical line ratios of [OI]$63\mu$m /
[CII]$158\mu$m $\approx 1$ and [OI]$145\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $ \approx 0.2 \,

conducting plasma is present in the voids, and that, because of the plasma,
\emph{diffusion} into the voids of galactic fields generated by a mean-field
dynamo is far too slow to explain the present-day void magnetization. Indeed,
we show that even in the presence of turbulence in the voids, dynamo-generated
galactic fields diffuse out to a galactocentric radius of only 200-400 kpc.
Therefore, it is challenging to meet the required volume filling-factor of the
void magnetic field. We conclude that a primordial origin remains the most
natural explanation to the space-filling weak fields in voids.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26877v1" target="_blank"><h2>Metallicity Gradients in Modern Cosmological Simulations II: The Role of

stellar feedback on galactic evolution. At high-redshift, when galaxies are
rapidly assembling, feedback-driven outflows and turbulence can strongly
reshape radial metallicity gradients. In this work, we use the FIRE-2, SPICE,
Thesan and Thesan Zoom cosmological simulations -- spanning a range of stellar
feedback from bursty (time-variable) to smooth (steady) -- to investigate how
these feedback modes shape gas-phase metallicity gradients at $3<z\lesssim11$.
Across all models, we find that galaxies with bursty feedback (FIRE-2, SPICE
Bursty, and Thesan Zoom) develop systematically flatter (factors of $\sim2-10$)
metallicity gradients than those with smooth feedback (SPICE Smooth and Thesan
Box), particularly at stellar masses $M_\star > 10^{9}~{\rm M_\odot}$. These
results demonstrate that bursty stellar feedback provides sufficient turbulence
to prevent strong negative gradients from forming, while smooth stellar
feedback does not generically allow for efficient radial redistribution of
metals thereby keeping gradients steep. Finally, we compare with recent
observations, finding that the majority -- but, notably, not all -- of the
observed gradients may favor a bursty stellar feedback scenario. In all, these
results highlight the utility of high-resolution observations of gas-phase
metallicity at high-redshift as a key discriminator of these qualitatively
different feedback types.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26990v1" target="_blank"><h2>Faint active galactic nuclei supplied 31-75% of hydrogen-ionizing

remains debated. Using recent JWST and ground-based surveys at 4.5 <= z <= 6.5,
we construct a unified rest-UV AGN luminosity function that separates
unobscured Type I and obscured Type II populations, and show that "little red
dots" and X-ray selected sources are magnitude-filtered subsets of Type I with
a mixture fraction eta = 0.10 +/- 0.02. We anchor the Lyman-continuum (LyC)
escape fraction to outflow incidence and geometric clearing rather than
assuming quasar-like values for all classes, and propagate uncertainties
through a joint fit. Integrating over -27 < M_UV < -17, AGN inject Ndot_ion,AGN
= (3.77 +1.08/-0.95) x 10^51 s^-1 Mpc^-3, nearly twice earlier estimates and
comparable to the Ly-alpha inferred requirement at z ~ 6. When combined with
the JWST galaxy UV luminosity function and a harder stellar ionizing efficiency
of log10(xi_ion) = 25.7, AGN contribute 31-75% of the total ionizing photons
for representative galaxy escape fractions f_esc,gal = 0.03-0.20. The resulting
hydrogen photoionization rate, Gamma_HI ~ (0.5-2) x 10^-12 s^-1 at z ~ 5-6,
lies squarely within the Ly-alpha forest constraints once mean free paths and
IGM clumpiness are accounted for, remaining consistent for combined AGN-galaxy
models up to f_esc,gal <= 5%. These results suggest that AGN and galaxies
jointly sustained the ionizing background during the final stages of
reionization, with AGN remaining a major but not exclusive contributor.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27300v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fluorine Evolution in the Galactic Halo</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Valeria Grisoni, Federico Rizzuti, Gabriele Cescutti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), high redshift (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The chemical evolution of fluorine is still a matter of debate in Galactic
archaeology, especially at low metallicities, where it is particularly
challenging to obtain the corresponding chemical abundances from observations.
We present here the first detailed theoretical study of the chemical evolution
of fluorine at low metallicity by means of a stochastic chemical evolution
model for the Galactic halo, in light of the most recent data for fluorine,
which further pushed observations to lower metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\sim$-4
dex, more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than previous detections. We
employ a state-of-the-art stochastic chemical evolution model to follow the
evolution in the Galactic halo, which has been shown to reproduce well the main
observables in this Galactic component and the abundance patterns of CNO and
neutron-capture elements, and we implement nucleosynthesis prescriptions for
fluorine, focusing on the chemical evolution of this element. By comparing
recent observations with model predictions, we confirm the importance of
rotating massive stars at low metallicities to explain both the [F/Fe] vs
[Fe/H] and [F/O] vs [O/H] diagrams. In particular, we showed that we can reach
high [F/Fe]$\sim$2 dex at [Fe/H]$\sim$-4 dex, in agreement with recent
observations at the lowest metallicity. With a stochastic chemical evolution
model for the Galactic halo, we confirm the importance of rotating massive
stars as fluorine producers, as hinted by previous studies using chemical
evolution models for the Galactic disc. We also expect an important production
of F at high redshift, in agreement with recent detections of supersolar N by
JWST. Further data for fluorine at low metallicities and also at high redshift
would be needed to put further constraints on the chemical evolution of
fluorine and be compared to our theoretical predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27678v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accretion-Driven Turbulence in the Circumgalactic Medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Roy Goldner, Jonathan Stern, Drummond Fielding, Claude-André Faucher-Giguère, Yakov Faerman, Aharon Kakoly</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract), CGM (abstract), circumgalactic medium (title, abstract), IGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Both observations and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that turbulence is
ubiquitous in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We study the development and
properties of CGM turbulence driven by accretion in halo masses of
$10^{10}-10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at redshifts $0\leq z\lesssim 2$, thus
providing a baseline for additional turbulence driving processes such as galaxy
feedback. Using analytic considerations and idealized hydrodynamical
simulations we demonstrate that in halos with mass up to $\sim10^{12}\,{\rm
M}_\odot$, even mild turbulent velocities near the virial radius of
$\sigma_{\rm t}(R_{\rm vir})\sim 10\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$ are enhanced by the
accretion process so that turbulent velocities are comparable to the virial
velocity at inner CGM radii, with $\sigma_{\rm t}(0.1\,R_{\rm vir})\approx
v_{\rm vir}\sim 100\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$. Rapid cooling at these inner radii
further implies that thermal pressure support is small, and the gas is
dominated by the cool and warm ($\sim10^4-10^5\,{\rm K}$) phases. Inner CGM
energetics are thus dominated by turbulence, with gas density distributions and
velocity structure functions similar to those seen in simulations of isothermal
supersonic ISM turbulence, rather than those seen in subsonically turbulent
stratified media such as the ICM. The gas accretion rate in these systems is
regulated by the turbulence dissipation rate rather than by the cooling rate as
in more massive halos. We argue that galaxy feedback is unlikely to
qualitatively change our conclusions unless it continuously injects high
specific energy material ($\gg v^2_{\rm vir}$) into the CGM. Such
`turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted
wide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV
absorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of $\sim L^\star$ and
lower-mass halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26875v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disk Formation and the Size-sSFR Relation of Dwarf Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Robel Geda, Akaxia Cruz, Anna C.

excellent probes for understanding dark matter and galaxy evolution. This work
investigates the physical processes that influence the sizes of isolated dwarf
galaxies using high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of $39$ dwarf
galaxies drawn from the Marvelous Massive Dwarfs simulation suite ($7.5 <
\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) < 9.1$). Our simulations show that dwarf galaxies
initially form as compact galaxies ($R_e < 2$ kpc). However, several of these
galaxies ($54\%$) experience periods of gradual size growth at relatively
stable sSFR, allowing them to become extended galaxies. We find that the growth
of rotation-supported stellar disks is the primary means by which isolated
dwarfs become extended in size. These stellar disks are formed by mergers with
high orbital angular momentum satellites on high angular momentum
(spiraling-in) orbits, which spin up the gas surrounding the central galaxy and
contribute $\approx 30 \%$ of the cold gas mass at $z=0$. For these systems,
star formation in the angular momentum supported gas and the gradual build up
of stars in the disk result in secular size growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27019v1" target="_blank"><h2>Baryonic Masses and Properties of Gaseous Satellite Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jingyao Zhu, Yasmeen Asali, Mary Putman, Tobias Westmeier, W.

line-width of $W_{50}=37$ km/s, comparable to the Local Group gaseous dwarf

dwarf galaxies and find $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{6.7} M_{\odot}$ for WALLABY and
$M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{5.4} M_{\odot}$ for MHONGOOSE at 10 Mpc. With this
sensitivity, our sample shows lower average gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\rm

satellites per host is low and increases with host mass: $0-2$ for isolated
dwarf galaxy hosts and $0-5$ for Milky Way-mass spiral hosts. These numbers are
consistent with the Milky Way, M31, and star-forming satellite abundances from

essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how
measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function
(PSF) and fitting software. We perform two-component S\'ersic+PSF fits of the
surface brightness profiles of 87 X-ray AGNs $(0.1 < z < 4)$ from the CEERS
survey. We create model PSFs for NIRCam F115W imaging using both photutils and
PSFEx. We find that PSFEx models consistently fail to match the radial profile
of typical point sources within our sample. We then perform AGN--host
decompositions on each source by creating S\'ersic+PSF models using both Galfit
and AstroPhot. We find that Galfit and AstroPhot converge to different regions
of the parameter space, providing consistently differing host galaxy
properties. While we can measure the AGN and host magnitudes accurately, we
find that the host galaxy morphological parameters are not well-determined --
the S\'ersic index and effective radius are strongly covariant. Significant
changes in the host galaxy parameters do not correspond to changes in the
statistical quality of fit, nor to significant changes in the model's radial
profile. These results indicate that the S\'ersic profile does not uniquely
well-represent typical AGN host galaxies in extragalactic survey fields. We
also provide recommendations for studies of AGN hosts comparable to ours.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27604v1" target="_blank"><h2>DiffstarPop: A generative physical model of galaxy star formation

(TDEs)-including an off-nuclear event associated with an ultra-compact dwarf
galaxy-selected for having available thermal X-ray spectra during their
late-time UV/optical plateau phase. We show that at these stages, the full
spectral energy distribution - X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry - is
well described by a compact, yet standard accretion disk, the same disk which
powers the X-rays at all times. By fitting up to three epochs per source with a
fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can be
reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass ($M_{\bullet}$).
These accretion-based $M_{\bullet}$ values, which in this sample span nearly
three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic scaling relations but
are significantly more precise (68\% credible interval $ < \pm 0.3$ dex) and
physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations (e.g., $L_{Bol}^{
disk} / L_{Edd} \propto T_p^4 \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1}$), TDE-specific physics
correlations ($L_{plat} \propto M_{\bullet}^{2/3}$ and $R_{out}/r_g \propto
M_{\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy correlations
($M_{\bullet}$-$M_{gal}$ and $M_{\bullet}$-$\sigma_{\star}$) naturally emerge
from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently extended into the
intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\bullet} < 10^{5}$) regime. We discuss the
implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling. We also review and
discuss different methods for $M_{\bullet}$ inference in TDEs, and find that
approaches based on physical models of the early-time UV/optical emission are
not able to recover (at a statistically significant level) black hole-host
galaxy scalings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26901v1" target="_blank"><h2>Universal numerical convergence criteria for subhalo tidal evolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Barry T.

simulations still suffer from the ``overmerging'' problem, where inadequate
force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and
premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have
been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and
all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive
simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution
of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We
report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous
tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer
equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or
subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We
also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in
the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass
resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any
further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both
premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved
subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in
state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or
mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid
refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26321v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shock-driven heating in the circumnuclear star-forming regions of NGC

data of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of the highly dust obscured
Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582, which is part of the sample of AGN in the Galaxy
Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Spatially resolved analysis of the
pure rotational H$_2$ lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law
temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent
southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas
temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We
investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation,
UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We
find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with
multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models
from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in
the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have
a high density ($n_H \sim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and are irradiated by a moderate
UV radiation field ($G_0 \sim 10^{3}$ Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham
shock models to the rotational H$_2$ lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1),
1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H$_2$ emission lines, we find that a slow ($v_s \sim 10$

analysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks

underpins the standard model of cosmology. Testing its validity using
independent astronomical probes remains crucial for understanding the global
structure of the Universe. We investigate the angular distribution of Gamma-Ray
Bursts (GRBs) using two of the most comprehensive all-sky datasets available,
the BATSE (CGRO) and Fermi GBM catalog to test the isotropy of the GRB sky at
large angular scales. We perform spherical harmonic decomposition of the GRB
sky maps and estimate the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes. Statistical
significance is evaluated by comparing the observed multipole amplitudes
against distributions derived from 500 Monte Carlo realizations of isotropic
skies. Our results show that the observed dipole amplitudes for both BATSE and
Fermi GBM datasets lie within $1\sigma$ region of their respective null
distributions. However, the quadrupole amplitude in the raw BATSE and Fermi
skies appears elevated at $3.7\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively. After
incorporating the BATSE sky exposure function, this apparent quadrupole
anisotropy vanishes, indicating that instrumental non-uniformities fully
account for the signal. Our method's reliability is validated through
controlled simulations, which show it can detect the injected dipoles in
BATSE-sized isotropic skies. These findings reinforce the statistical isotropy
of the GRB sky and underscore the importance of accurate exposure corrections

a massive black hole, creating a debris stream that returns to the black hole,
forms an accretion flow, and powers a luminous flare. Over the last few
decades, several numerical studies have concluded that shock-induced
dissipation occurs as the stream returns to pericentre (i.e.,
pre-self-intersection), resulting in efficient circularisation of the debris.
However, the efficacy of these shocks is the subject of intense debate. We
present high-resolution simulations (up to 10^10 particles) of the disruption
of a solar-like star by a 10^6M_sun black hole with the new, GPU-based,
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code SPH-EXA, including the relativistic
apsidal precession of the stellar debris orbits; our simulations run from
initial disruption to the moment of stream self-intersection. With 10^8
particles - corresponding to the highest-resolution SPH simulations of TDEs in
the pre-existing literature - we find significant, in-plane spreading of the
debris as the stream returns through pericenter, in line with previous works
that suggested this is a significant source of dissipation and luminous
emission. However, with increasing resolution this effect is dramatically
diminished, and with 10^10 particles there is effectively no change between the
incoming and the outgoing stream widths. Our results demonstrate that the
paradigm of significant dissipation of kinetic energy during pericentre passage
is incorrect, and instead it is likely that debris circularisation is mediated
by the originally proposed, stream-stream collision scenario.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27332v1" target="_blank"><h2>Jacobi capture as a pathway to off-center massive black hole binaries in

merge outside galactic centers may play a key role in shaping black hole mass
assembly. Here, we investigate the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf

timescales and core stalling naturally arise. By embedding off-center black
holes into an idealized galactic potential and scanning a wide range of orbital
configurations, we assess the likelihood of close interactions through Jacobi

including the subhalo mass function, spatial distribution, maximum circular
velocity $V_\text{max}$, and its corresponding radius $ R_\text{max} $ -- to
evaluate the consistency between these two modeling frameworks. Both models
predict a suppression of low-mass subhalos correlated with decreasing WDM
particle mass, and that WDM subhalos tend to have lower $V_\text{max} $ and
larger $ R_\text{max} $ values than their CDM counterparts at fixed mass. While
{\sc Galacticus} provides more statistically precise results due to a larger

from Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and W1-band

correlation analysis to study the time lags between different bands, which may
be directly related to the size of the dust torus. After correcting for
infrared flux contamination from the accretion disk and accounting for the
redshift effect, we measure the Ks-optical and W1-optical lags for the targets
VVV J1834-2925 and VVV J1845-2426. Using typical sublimation temperatures and
reverberation time lags, we obtain a graphite-to-silicate grain size ratio of

and dissolution of star clusters and dwarf galaxies as well as through their
complex interactions with the Galactic disc. Traces of these accreted
structures persist to the present day in the chemical and kinematic properties
of stars and their orbits and allow for the disentangling of the accretion
history of the Galaxy through observations of Milky Way stars.
  We utilised 6D phase-space information in combination with [Fe/H]
measurements to facilitate a clustering analysis of stars using their
kinematics and chemistry simultaneously, a technique known as chemo-kinematic
tagging. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), we
performed dimensionality reduction and identify stars from clusters and streams
that are co-localised in the kinematic and chemical parameter space. We
included E, Jr, Jz, Lz, r_apo, r_peri, and eccentricity as well as [Fe/H] as
input into the algorithm, and used a sample of 5347 stars from 229 individual
Milky Way substructures compiled from various sources in the literature.
  Most notably, we recovered several large-scale structures that have been
reported in the literature, including GSE, Thamnos, Sequoia, I'itoi,
LMS-1/Wukong, Sagittarius, Kraken/Koala, the splashed disc, and a candidate
structure recently found in another work. We find that 44\% of Milky Way
globular clusters are consistent with having an accreted origin. We also find
that the chemo-dynamic properties of omega cen are consistent with a common
accretion with the Thamnos structure. In addition, we identified many
stream-progenitor associations, most notably a connection between the
Orphan-Chenab stream and the Grus II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, which supports
previous findings that these two objects were brought into the Galaxy in the

enable cosmological analyses of cluster number counts that require accurate
cosmological model predictions. One possibility is to use parametric fits
calibrated against $N$-body simulations, that capture the cosmological
parameter dependence of the halo mass function. Several studies have shown that
this can be obtained through a calibration against haloes with spherical masses
defined at the virial overdensity. In contrast, if different mass definitions
are used for the HMF and the scaling relation, a mapping between them is
required. Here, we investigate the impact of such a mapping on the cosmological
parameter constraints inferred from galaxy cluster number counts. Using
synthetic data from $N$-body simulations, we show that the standard approach,
which relies on assuming a concentration-mass relation, can introduce
significant systematic bias. In particular, depending on the mass definition
and the relation assumed, this can lead to biased constraints at more than
2$\sigma$ level. In contrast, we find that in all the cases we have considered,
the mass conversion based on the halo sparsity statistics result in a
systematic bias smaller than the statistical error.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26554v1" target="_blank"><h2>The $N_H$ Distribution of Hard X-ray Selected AGN in the NEP Field</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Samantha Creech, Francesca Civano, Daniel R.

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-30$) offers a
powerful probe of new physics. One standard mechanism for constraining decaying
dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic
medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with
the uncertain Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In
this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons
produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the
spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal.
This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on
uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic
heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses
$m_{\chi}\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces
Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to
probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including
axion-like particles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26329v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing the evolution of brightest galaxies and diffuse light in galaxy

simulations designed to advance the understanding of the role of purely
gravitational dynamics in the early formation of low-mass galaxy groups (~ 1-5
x 10^13 M_sun). In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of key
indicators of dynamical relaxation, with particular emphasis on the secular
growth of the diffuse intragroup light (IGL), the four major group galaxies,
and the mass distributions of their progenitors. We also assess the diagnostic
power of several magnitude gaps between top-ranked galaxies as proxies for
dynamical age. As in our previous study, we compare outcomes from three group
classes defined by the number of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) present at the
end of the simulations. The early assembly of galaxy groups is consistent with
a stochastic Poisson process at an approximately constant merger rate. Various
dynamical diagnostics - including galaxy pairwise separations, velocity
dispersions, and the offset of the first-ranked galaxy from the group
barycentre - indicate that single-BGG groups evolve more rapidly towards
virialisation than double- and especially non-BGG systems. We further find that
first-ranked group members and the IGL, follow distinct growth histories, with
the IGL assembled from a more numerous and systematically lower-mass population
than the central object. This distinction is particularly pronounced in non-BGG
systems, where about one third of the IGL originates from small galaxies, each
contributing less than 5% to this component. Among the tested magnitude gaps,
the difference between the first- and fourth-ranked galaxies, $\Delta M4-1$,
proves a more robust indicator of dynamical age for low-mass groups than the
conventional $\Delta M2-1$ gap. The $\Delta M5-1$ and $\Delta M6-1$ gaps also
perform well and may be preferable in certain contexts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26970v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Critical Examination of the PAH Hypothesis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alan T. Tokunaga, Lawrence S. Bernstein, Takashi Onaka</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted for publication by MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) hypothesis proposes that the
aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) observed at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7
mic originate from gas-phase PAH molecules. These bands exhibit consistent peak
wavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show
a nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic
AIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the
AIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless
of the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions,
reflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse
interstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is
inconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH
types and sizes. It is also inconsistent with the lack of observed UV and
optical absorption bands from gas phase PAH molecules. Furthermore, there is no
plausible formation pathway to produce only a small number of specific PAH
molecules in the interstellar medium. These issues require quantitative
investigation in order to definitively establish gas-phase PAH molecules as the
carrier of the AIBs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26976v1" target="_blank"><h2>Connecting Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies. I.
  Comparability of Molecular Cloud Physical Properties</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J. W. Zhou, Sami Dib</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract), feedback (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We used CO (2-1) and CO (1-0) data cubes to identify molecular clouds and
study their kinematics and dynamics in three nearby galaxies and the inner
Milky Way. When observed at similar spatial and velocity resolutions, molecular
clouds in the same mass range across these galaxies show broadly comparable
physical properties and similar star formation rates (SFRs). However, this
comparability depends on smoothing Milky Way clouds to match the resolution of
the extragalactic observations. The beam effect can artificially inflate cloud
sizes, leading to inaccurate estimates of radius, density, and virial
parameters. By comparing high-resolution and smoothed Milky Way data, we
established criteria to exclude beam-affected clouds in the extragalactic
sample. After applying this filter, cloud properties remain consistent across
galaxies, though some clouds in NGC 5236 show elevated velocity dispersions,
likely due to environmental effects. In the inner Milky Way, molecular clouds
fall into two groups: those with clumps and those without. Clump-associated
clouds are more massive, denser, have higher velocity dispersions, lower virial
parameters, and stronger 8~\(\mu\)m emission, suggesting more intense feedback.
Strong correlations are found between cloud mass and total clump mass, clump
number, and the mass of the most massive clump. These results suggest that a
cloud's physical conditions regulate its internal clump properties and, in
turn, its star-forming potential.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26979v1" target="_blank"><h2>Supplementing the 2MRS survey: The 2MZoA catalogue</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

(|b| <= 10.0 deg, called Zone of Avoidance, ZoA) which is complete to a
Galactic extinction-corrected magnitude of Ko <= 11.75 mag. Also included are
galaxies at higher latitudes in areas of high foreground extinctions (E(B-V) >
0.95). This catalogue supersedes the previously presented bright 2MZoA
catalogue which was only complete to Ko < 11.25 mag. It fully complements the
2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxy catalogue, which has the same magnitude
limit but excludes high extinction regions. The combination of the two
catalogues, the extended 2MRS or e2MRS, is is a uniquely whole sky redshift
survey and forms a sound basis for studies of large-scale structures, flow
fields and extinction across the ZoA.
  The here presented catalogue comprises 6899 galaxies with 6757 galaxies at
low latitudes and 142 galaxies in highly obscured high-latitude areas. The
completion rate in redshifts is almost 75%. The catalogue is complete up to
star density levels of at least log N_*/deg^2 < 4.3, but the completion rate of
the fainter part is affected by foreground extinction at all levels. This can
be rectified by using a diameter-dependent extinction correction, adding 1083
highly obscured but apparently faint galaxies (with Ko > 11.75 mag and Ko,d <=
11.75 mag) to the sample. This extended sample shows good completion rates with
extinction up to at least AK < 1.3 mag. Omission of such a diameter-dependent
extinction correction may lead to a biased flow field even at intermediate
extinction values as found in the 2MRS survey. As in our previous
investigations, we do not find a dependence of the correction factor f=0.86 to
the extinction maps on Galactic longitudes or latitudes, but note a possible
influence by cosmic variance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27459v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ultra-diffuse Galaxy Analogues in the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam

(NUDGEs) in a large sample of galaxy clusters to investigate their properties
with respect to the host clusters. We used data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program wide field survey and find a total of 5057 NUDGEs
exceeding the background counts in 51 out of 66 galaxy clusters. The clusters
span the redshift range 0.08$\,<\,$z$\,<\,$0.15 and they have a mass range of
$0.95\times10^{14}\,\text{M}_\odot - 8.34\times10^{14}\,\text{M}_\odot$. The
properties of these NUDGEs are found to be similar to UDGs studied in previous
works and reaffirm that they are an extension of a continuous galaxy
distribution. The number of NUDGEs as a function of cluster halo mass for our
sample follows the power law: $N\propto M_{200}^{0.78\pm\,0.28} $. This fit is
consistent with previous UDG studies and, together with our NUDGE sizes
distributions, matches well with the simulations of UDGs in cored dark matter
haloes formed by tidal stripping. The NUDGE density distribution with respect
to clustercentric radius of our sample is flatter than previous UDG studies,
although the red NUDGEs in this sample show a statistically significant
decrease in density with respect to clustercentric radius, indicating that red
UDGs may be more affected by their environment than blue UDGs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27036v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quantifying Spectroscopic Flux Variations Between JWST NIRISS and

2744 galaxy cluster field. From approximately 120 candidates, we identify 12
objects with at least a prominent emission lines among \Oii, \Hb, \Oiiia,
\Oiiib, and \Ha that are spectroscopically confirmed by both instruments. Our
key findings reveal systematic differences between the two spectrographs based
on source morphology and shutter aperture placement. Compact objects show
comparable or higher integrated flux in NIRSpec relative to NIRISS (within
1$\sigma$ uncertainties), while extended sources consistently display higher
flux in NIRISS measurements. This pattern reflects NIRSpec's optimal coverage
for compact objects while potentially undersampling extended sources.
Quantitative analysis demonstrates that NIRSpec recovers at least $63\%$ of
NIRISS-measured flux when the slit covers $>15\%$ of the source or when
$R_e<1$kpc. For lower coverage or larger effective radii, the recovered flux
varies from $24\%$ to $63\%$. When studying the \Ha/\Oiiib emission line ratio,
we observe that measurements from these different spectrographs can vary by up
to $\sim$0.3 dex, with significant implications for metallicity and star
formation rate characterizations for individual galaxies. These results
highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining
multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology
critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless
spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26889v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Luminosity Function of the Coma Cluster from Deep $u'-g'-r'$

$\approx1.5\,\mathrm{deg^2}$ around the cluster center. The dataset comprises
deep $u'$-, $g'$-, and $r'$-band data obtained with the Wendelstein Wide Field
Imager on the 2.1\,m Fraunhofer Wendelstein Telescope reaching median $3\sigma$
surface brightness limits in $10"\times10"$ boxes of $\mathrm{

parameters across a large dynamic range in galaxy brightness
($-24.5\,g'\,\mathrm{mag} \lessapprox M\lessapprox-11.3\,g'\,\mathrm{mag}$),
from the brightest cluster galaxy to low-luminosity dwarfs, including compact
dwarf galaxies and ultra-diffuse galaxies. We automatically identify 5161
cluster member candidates based on their membership on the quiescent sequence
in the $u'-g'$ versus $g'-r'$ color--color diagram and their red sequence
membership. The structural parameters of bright galaxies are obtained via
isophotal modeling, and fully automated parametric image fitting for faint
ones. Injection-recovery tests and two identically analyzed reference fields
provide statistical corrections for completeness and contamination, yielding a
representative GLF that reliably probes the faint end and may serve as a
benchmark for future studies. We report a best-fit double Schechter $g'$ band
GLF with a comparatively steep faint-end slope
$\alpha_2=-1.539^{+0.024}_{-0.024}$. We perform an apples-to-apples comparison
with the Coma counterpart in the SLOW simulations, finding overall agreement
but a deficit of bright and an excess of dwarf galaxies in the simulation,
despite its shallower faint-end slope, highlighting the need for true
apples-to-apples comparisons that consider both normalization and slope for a
consistent interpretation of the GLF.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26405v2" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM Observations of The Prototypical Cold Front in Abell 3667</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuki Omiya, Yuto Ichinohe, Kazuhiro Nakazawa, Hisamitsu Awaki, Dominique Eckert, Yutaka Fujita, Isamu Hatsukade, Maxim Markevitch, François Mernier, Ikuyuki Mitsuishi, Naomi Ota, Aurora Simionescu, Yuusuke Uchida, Shutaro Ueda, Irina Zhuravleva, John Zuhone</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title, abstract), AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging galaxy cluster
Abell 3667 with \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. Two observations, targeting the cluster
X-ray core and the prototypical cold front, were performed with exposures of
105 ks and 276 ks, respectively. We find that the gas in the core is
blueshifted by $v_z\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster
galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by
$v_z\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front,
the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $\Delta
v_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the
core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the
cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold
front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset
merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster
and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The
region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen
across two pointings, $\sigma_z\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted
as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the
front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the
lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some
mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B>5\,\mu$G is
required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27501v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ion-molecule routes towards cycles in TMC-1. An automated study of the

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM). The
synthesis of PAHs from simpler precursors is known as the "bottom-up" theory,
which, so far, has been dominated by reactions between organic radicals.
However, this mechanism struggles to account for the origin of the smallest
cycles themselves. Ion-molecule reactions emerge as promising alternative
pathways to explain the formation of these molecules. In the present work, we
investigate the reaction network of the main ionic precursor of cyclopentadiene
c-C5H7+ . To this end, we establish an integrated protocol that combines
astrochemical modelling to identify viable formation routes under cold
interstellar medium conditions, automated reaction path search and kinetic
simulations to obtain accurate descriptions of the reaction pathways and
reliable rate constants. In particular, we examine the reaction between
ethylene (C2H4) and the linear propargyl cation (CH2CCH+). Our results reveal
that the formation of c-C5H7+ by radiative association turns out to be
inefficient, contrary to our initial expectations. Instead, the system
predominantly evolves through bimolecular channels yielding c-C5H5+ and
CH3CCH2+ with the formation of c-C5H5+ offering new insights into reactivity
that supports molecular growth in the ISM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26731v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae

sample of SNe~Ia around these massive environments, we aim to provide new
constraints on bulk-flow models while laying the groundwork for improved
estimates of supercluster masses. Here, we present data from the first two
seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02<z<0.06), which is responsible
for a large but unknown fraction of our local group's motion. Until now, no
supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES
survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper,
including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves
of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate
that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various
rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor
superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN
Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating
how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and
highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample
of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the

multi-wavelength emission, of which the optical emission is of ambiguous
origin. A unification scenario of tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been
proposed to explain the different classes of X-ray and optically selected
events by introducing a dependence on the viewing angle and geometry. This work
aims to test the unification scenario among optically bright TDEs using
polarimetry. By studying the optical linear polarisation of 19 TDEs (of which 9
newly analysed in this work), we place constraints on their photosphere
geometry, inclination, and the emission process responsible for the optical
radiation. We study how these properties correlate with the relative X-ray
brightness. We find that 14/16 non-relativistic events can be accommodated by
the unification model. Continuum polarisation levels of optical TDEs lie most
often in the range P ~ 1-2% (13 events), and for all except one event, remain
below 6%. For those optical TDEs that have multi-epoch polarimetry, the
continuum polarisation decreases after peak light for 5/10 events, increases
for 3/10 events, and stays nearly constant for 2/10 events. When observed after
+70 days (7/16 events), they become consistent with P = 0% within uncertainties
(5/7 events). This implies the photosphere geometries of TDEs are at least
initially asymmetric and evolve rapidly which, if tracing the formation of the
accretion disk, suggests efficient circularisation. The polarisation signatures
of emission lines of 7 TDEs directly support a scenario in which optical light
is reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere. [...] However, a subset
of events deviates from the unification model to some extent, suggesting this
model may not fully capture the diverse behaviour of TDEs. Multi-epoch
polarimetry plays a key role in understanding the evolution and emission
mechanisms of TDEs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26209v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-Faceted Emission Properties of PSR J2129+4119 Observed with FAST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Habtamu Menberu Tedila, Di Li, Pei Wang, Rai Yuen, Ziwei Wu, Shijun Dang, Jianping Yuan, Na Wang, Marilyn Cruces, Jun Shuo Zhang, Juntao Bai, De Zhao, FAST Collaboration</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 18 figures, Revised for ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), LLS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a detailed single-pulse study of the long-period pulsar PSR
J2129+4119 using high-sensitivity FAST observations. Despite locating well

emission behavior, including nulls, weak pulses, regular emission, and
occasional bright pulses. The nulling fraction is measured to be $8.13\% \pm
0.51\%$, with null durations typically under four pulse periods. Fluctuation
spectral analysis reveals both phase-modulated subpulse drifting and
intermittent beat-like modulation. At the same time, polarization profiles show
high linear polarization and stable polarization position angle (PPA) swings
consistent with a near-tangential sightline geometry. Quasi-periodic
microstructures are detected in 11.54\% of regular pulses, with a mean
