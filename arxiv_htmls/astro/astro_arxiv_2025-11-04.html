  Supernova Remnants</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Emanuele Greco</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Invited mini-review in the Frontiers Research Topic: "The Role of plasmas and Cosmic Magnetism in High-energy Astroparticle Physics", accepted for publication</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Magnetic turbulence plays a crucial role in confining charged particles near
the shock front of Supernova Remnants, enabling them to reach energies up to
hundreds of TeV through a process known as Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA).
These high-energy electrons spiral along magnetic field lines, emitting X-ray
synchrotron radiation. The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer
(IXPE) has opened a new window into the study of magnetic fields in SNRs
through X-ray polarization measurements. For the first time, IXPE allows us to
resolve the polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA) in the X-ray band across
different areas of SNRs, offering direct insight into the geometry and
coherence of magnetic fields on different scales. In this mini-review, I
summarize the key observational results on SNRs obtained with IXPE over the
past four years and discuss their implications for our understanding of
magnetic turbulence in synchrotron-emitting regions. I also show how we can
combine polarization parameters and standard X-ray spectral/imaging analysis to
better constrain the structure and scale of magnetic turbulence immediately
downstream of the shock and understand the particle acceleration occurring in
SNRs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27605v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Gravity at Large Scales with kSZ-Reconstructed Velocities and
  CMB Lensing</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Raagini Patki, Nicholas Battaglia, Rachel Bean</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables. To be submitted to Phys. Rev. D</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a new method for measuring the $E_G$ statistic that combines two
CMB secondaries -- the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect and CMB lensing
-- for the first time to probe gravity on linear scales. The $E_G$ statistic is
a discriminating tool for modified gravity theories, which leave imprints in
lensing observables and peculiar velocities. Existing $E_G$ measurements rely
on redshift space distortions (RSD) to infer the velocity field. Here, we
employ kSZ velocity-reconstruction instead of RSD, a complementary technique
that constrains the largest-scale modes better than the galaxy survey it uses.
We construct a novel $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator that involves a ratio between
cross-correlations of a galaxy sample with a CMB convergence map and that with
a 3D kSZ-reconstructed velocity field. We forecast for current and upcoming CMB
maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory
(SO), respectively, in combination with three spectroscopic galaxy samples from
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find cumulative detection
significances in the range $S/N \sim 20-55$, which can robustly test the
scale-independent $E_G$ prediction under general relativity (GR) at different
effective redshifts of the galaxy samples ($z\approx 0.73, 1.33, 1.84$). In
particular, the SO$\times$DESI LRG measurement would be able to distinguish
between GR and certain modified gravity models, including Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and
Chameleon theories, with high confidence. The proposed $\widehat{V}_G$
estimator opens up a new avenue for stress-testing gravity and the
$\Lambda$CDM+GR model at the largest observable scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27416v1" target="_blank"><h2>Earth-lens telescope for distant axion-like particle sources with
  stimulated backward reflection</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Taiyo Nakamura, Kensuke Homma</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a novel telescope concept based on Earth's gravitational lensing
effect, optimized for the detection of distant dark matter sources,
particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). When a unidirectional flux of dark
matter passes through Earth at sufficiently high velocity, gravitational
lensing can concentrate the flux at a distant focal region in space. Our method
combines this lensing effect with stimulated backward reflection (SBR), arising
from ALP decays that are induced by directing a coherent electromagnetic beam
toward the focal point. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze the
structure of the focal region and to develop a framework for estimating the
sensitivity to ALP-photon coupling via this mechanism. Numerical calculations
show that, assuming an average ALP velocity of 520,km/s -- as suggested by the
observed stellar stream S1 -- the focal region extends from $9 \times 10^9$,m
to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$,m, with peak density near $9.6 \times 10^9$,m. For a
conservative point-like ALP source located approximately 8,kpc from the solar
system, based on the S1 stream, the estimated sensitivity in the eV mass range
reaches $g/M = \mathcal{O}(10^{-22}),\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This concept thus
opens a path toward a general-purpose, space-based ALP observatory that could,
in principle, detect more distant sources -- well beyond
$\mathcal{O}(10),\mathrm{kpc}$ -- provided that ALP-photon coupling is
sufficiently strong, that is, $M \ll M_\mathrm{Planck}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27587v1" target="_blank"><h2>CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of
  inflation and freeze-in dark matter production</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anish Ghoshal, Paweł Kozów, Marek Olechowski, Stefan Pokorski</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 12 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating
temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain
freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of
$\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all
independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of
the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$,
scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a
standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state
parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating
temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some
pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model
independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the
upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each
class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral
index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB
data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact
on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying
those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB
observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an
example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One
obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM
production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the
reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints
on the DM production will follow.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27579v1" target="_blank"><h2>String-induced vacuum decay</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Aleksandr Chatrchyan, Florian Niedermann, Phoebe Richman-Taylor</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 8 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles
of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean
time. In this work, we investigate how the presence of cosmic strings can
catalyze the decay process. To this end, we consider a complex scalar field
charged under a global or local $U(1)$ symmetry. Assuming a non-trivial vacuum
manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive
relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding
to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field.
Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of
parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative
channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of
cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational
wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible
connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.</p></br></body>
