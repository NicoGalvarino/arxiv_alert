spectra of background quasars and the nature of associated galaxies across a
broad redshift range of $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$. Using nebular [O II]
$\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 emission lines identified in DESI fiber spectra
centered on quasar, we detect 377 galaxies at a typical detection rate of
$\sim$0.45% at $z \lesssim 1$, which increases with MgII equivalent width
($W_{2796}$). A significant fraction (74%) of these galaxies are associated
with strong absorbers with $W_{2796} \ge$ 2\r{A}. These absorbers trace
galaxies spanning stellar masses of $\rm 8.4 \le \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \le
11.6$ and star formation rates (SFRs) of $\rm -1.2 \le
log(SFR~[M_{\odot}yr^{-1}]) \le 2.7$, located at projected galactocentric
distances of 4-24 kpc. We find the average MgII absorber strength increases
from 2.1\r{A} to 2.9\r{A} between redshifts $z \sim$ 0.4 and 1.2, indicating
evolution in the cool gas content of galaxy halos. The relatively constant
absorber strength with galactocentric distance implies a clumpy structure of
cool gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Further, we find a positive
correlation between $W_{2796}$ versus $M_\star$, and SFR, suggesting that the
distribution of metal-enriched cool gas in the CGM is closely tied to the
properties of the host galaxies. The redshift evolution of gas-phase
metallicity suggests that strong MgII absorbers trace the general population of
star-forming galaxies. The velocity dispersion of the cool gas increases with
halo mass, and the wide range of line of sight velocity offset (-389 to 364
$\rm km\ s^{-1}$) between the galaxy systemic velocity and absorbers highlights
the dynamical nature of CGM. However, the majority of this gas remains
gravitationally bound to the dark matter halos, consistent with a picture of
gas recycling via galactic fountains.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02697v1" target="_blank"><h2>Time-Dependent Cosmic Ray Halos from Bursty Star Formation and Active

Comments and questions most welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), galaxy formation (title), ISM (title, abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract), CGM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution has seen a theoretical
resurgence in the past decade, but significant uncertainties remain in CR
transport through the interstellar and circum-galactic media (ISM and CGM).
While several works indicate CR effects may be notable in both star-forming and
quenched massive galaxies, modeling the vast CR transport parameter space
currently allowed by observations is computationally restrictive to survey.
Analytic treatments of CR feedback have provided useful insights to potential
ramifications in different regimes, but have relied on time-steady assumptions
which may not well characterize CR effects at different cosmic epochs and
galaxy mass scales. We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing
the time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified
assumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR
transport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from
bursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially
alter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies
($\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a
significant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies
($\gtrsim M_{\textrm{halo}} \sim 10^{13} M_\odot$), and we speculate that these
time-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio
Circles". Finally, we benchmark our semi-analytic formalism against a cosmic
ray-magnetohydrodynamic (CR-MHD) cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation
directly modeling the CR scattering rate and emergent transport in full
generality, highlighting the validity of our approach. We conclude by
motivating careful consideration of time-dependent ``softening" effects in
sub-grid routines for CR feedback, particularly for use in large cosmological
volumes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02019v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detection of 'super-virial' gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the

$z=0$ absorbing phases using Chandra and XMM-Newton grating spectra toward the
blazar PKS 2155$\hbox{-}$304. We detect the MgXII K$\alpha$ absorption line for
the first time in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. Along with
MgXII K$\alpha$, we detect SiXIV K$\alpha$ absorption, which are the tell-tale
signatures of the hot 'super-virial' gas in the CGM. Both from the
model-independent calculations and hybrid-ionization modeling, we infer four
phases at distinct temperatures, hot 'super-virial' ($5.4^{+1.9}_{-0.8} \times
10^7$ K), warm-hot 'virial' ($1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times 10^6$ K), warm
'sub-virial' ($2.2\pm 0.5 \times 10^5$ K), and cool phase ($<1.7 \times 10^5$
K). The warm-hot and hot phases are $\alpha$-enhanced, and [C/O] and [Ne/O] are
super-solar in the warm-hot phase, while [Mg/O] and [Si/O] are super-solar in
the hot phase. The low-ionization lines are blue-shifted (v$_{\rm los} \approx
-100$ km s$^{-1}$), whereas the high-ionization lines are red-shifted. It
suggests a scenario of infalling sub-virial, quasi-static virial, and
outflowing super-virial phases along this sightline. Earlier studies on
individual sightlines were confined to the Northern Hemisphere. Our sightline
is located in the Southern hemisphere, demonstrating that hot super-virial gas
is also present at Southern Galactic latitudes as well. This confirms a more
widespread distribution of the super-virial gas across both hemispheres.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02664v1" target="_blank"><h2>Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fabio Pacucci, Lars Hernquist, Michiko Fujii</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. 12 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown
population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots"
(LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of
$10^9-10^{11} \, \rm M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme
central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$ and in
some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of
globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \,
\rm M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $< 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass
segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment
using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an
analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and
(iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions
produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 < M_{\rm VMS} \, [\rm M_\odot] <
5\times10^4$ within $<1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the
VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a
general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet
\sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the
formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This
pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from
direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can
sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02434v1" target="_blank"><h2>How far have metals reached? Reconciling statistical constraints and

galaxies are proportional, the proportionality factor being the mean absorbing
cross section. In this paper we use redshift parameterizations of these two
statistics to predict the cosmic evolution of an equivalent-width ($W_r$)
radial profile model, tailored for the low-ionization species Mg II and O I.
Our model provides an excellent match with well-sampled, low-redshift Mg II
equivalent-width/impact-parameter pairs from the literature. We then focus on
the evolution of various quantities between the Reionization and Cosmic Noon
eras. Our findings are: (1) The extent of Mg II and hence the amount of cool
($T\sim 10^4$ K), enriched gas in the average halo decreases continuously with
cosmic time after $z \approx 6$--$8$. This effect is more pronounced in
$W_r^{2796}\lesssim 0.3$ {\AA} systems (outermost layers of the model) and, in
general, affects O I more than Mg II, probably due to the onset of
photoionization by the UV background. (2) The line density of
$W_r^{2796}\gtrsim 1$ {\AA} systems (model inner layers) constantly increases
in synchrony with the star formation rate density until it reaches a peak at
Cosmic Noon. The line density of $W_r^{2796}\lesssim 0.3$ {\AA} systems, on the
other hand, remains constant or decreases over the same period. (3) At the end
of Reionization, the filling factor is low enough that the winds have not yet
reached neighboring halos. This implies that the halos are self-enriched, as
suggested by semi-analytic models. We discuss how these statistical predictions
can be reconciled with early metal enrichment models and offer a practical
comparison point for future analyses of quasar absorption lines at $z>6$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01671v1" target="_blank"><h2>Recovering the Dust Mass Budget with PRIMA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

one elusive component is represented by interstellar dust. In this work, we
exploit the IR mission PRIMA (covering wavelengths from 24 $\mu$m to 235

still poorly known dust mass function (DMF) at $z \sim 0.5 - 5$. We consider
the spectro-photometric realization of the SPRITZ simulation and we compute the
dust masses using single temperature Modified Grey Body functions. We show how
PRIMA alone, thanks to its unprecedented sensitivities, will constrain the DMF
at $z < 1.5$, in terms of mass and faint-end slope. At $z > 1.5$, we stress the
key synergy with current or future sub-millimeter facilities, such as the
JCMT/SCUBA-2, AtLAST, LMT and ALMA telescopes, that will allow us to probe the
R$-$J regime of PRIMA selected galaxies. Finally, PRIMA, thanks to its large
photometric coverage, will be able for the first time to constrain strictly the

in the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample of 18 star-forming galaxies
($M_\star>10^{9.5}~M_{\odot}$) at redshifts $z=4.4-5.7$. Using JWST/NIRSpec
IFU, we identify 7 AGN candidates through the detection of broad \Ha\ emission
lines from 33 aperture spectra centred on photometric peaks. These candidates
include one highly robust AGN detection with FWHM $\sim$ 2800 \kms\ and six
showing broad components with FWHM $\sim 600-1600$ \kms, with two in a merger
system. We highlight that only broad-line detection is effective since these
candidates uniformly lie within narrow emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams
where star-forming galaxies and AGNs overlap. The broad-line AGN fraction
ranges from 5.9\% to 33\%, depending on the robustness of the candidates.
Assuming that the majority are AGNs, the relatively high AGN fraction is likely
due to targeting high-mass galaxies, where simulations demonstrate that
broad-line detection is more feasible. Their black hole masses range from
$10^6$ to $10^{7.5}~M_{\odot}$ with $0.1 \lesssim L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm
Edd}\lesssim 1$. Counter to previous JWST studies at high redshift that found
overmassive black holes relative to their host galaxies, our candidates lie
close to or below the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ scaling relations, thus
demonstrating the effect of selection biases. This study provides new insights
into AGN-host galaxy co-evolution at high redshift by identifying faint
broad-line AGNs in galaxy samples, highlighting the importance of considering
mass-dependent selection biases and the likelihood of a large population of
AGNs being undermassive and just now being tapped by JWST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02431v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can an Anti-de Sitter Vacuum in the Dark Energy Sector Explain JWST

To be submitted to JCAP</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), galaxy formation (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) discovery of an unexpectedly high
abundance of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts $z > 10$ poses a significant
challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This work tests whether this
tension can be resolved solely by modifying the cosmological background,
without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early
galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an
anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises
in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure
formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy
evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of
observations. We first show that while a model tailored to fit the high-$z$ UV
luminosity functions (UVLFs) shows promise, it is in strong tension with
well-established cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift
probes. Conversely, models within this framework that are consistent with these
constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to
reproduce the observed JWST galaxy abundances at $z > 10$. While these models
remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, our primary result is
that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to
explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the critical importance of
holistic testing for any beyond-$\Lambda$CDM proposal; apparent success in one
observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the
limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case
that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving
the challenge of early galaxy formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03159v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray reverberation modelling of the observed UV/optical power spectra

investigating the ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring
and surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination
of AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability.
Our main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the
assumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain
the observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc
transfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical
model and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model
allows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the
scenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an
external source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc
transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power
spectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars
determined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light
curves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of
quasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\sim 1300$\AA\ up to
$4000$\AA. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the
accretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while
the X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in
agreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray
reverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as
recent time-lag measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02687v1" target="_blank"><h2>ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Exploring the origin of the Type Ia supernova

stellar masses is well documented. In particular, Hubble residuals display a
luminosity shift based on host mass, known as the mass step, which is often
used as an extra correction in the standardisation of SN Ia luminosities. Here
we investigate Hubble residuals and the mass step in the context of Si II
$\lambda 6355$ velocities, using 277 near-peak SNe Ia from ZTF DR2. We divide
the sample into high-velocity (HV) and normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia, separated
at 12,000 km/s, resulting in 70 HV and 207 NV objects. We then examine links
between Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x_{1}$, colour
$c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or
progenitor-related effects. Although we only find a marginal difference between
the Hubble residuals of HV and NV SNe Ia, the NV mass step is $0.149 \pm 0.024$
mag ($6.3\sigma$), while HV SNe Ia show $0.046 \pm 0.041$ mag ($1.1\sigma$),
consistent with zero. The NV-HV mass-step difference is $\sim 2.2\sigma$. The
clearest subtype difference is seen in central regions ($d_{DLR} < 1$), where
NV SNe Ia show a strong mass step but HV SNe Ia none, yielding a
$3.1-3.6\sigma$ difference. A host-colour step appears for both: NV $0.142 \pm
0.024$ mag ($5.9\sigma$) and HV $0.158 \pm 0.042$ mag ($3.8\sigma$). Overall,
NV and HV colour steps are consistent. HV SNe Ia show modest ($\sim
2.5$-$3\sigma$) steps in outer regions ($d_{DLR} > 1$), while NV SNe show
stronger environmental trends. Thus, NV SNe Ia appear more environmentally
sensitive, especially in central, likely metal-rich and older regions, while HV
SNe Ia show weaker, subset-dependent trends, and applying a universal mass-step
correction could introduce biases. Refined classifications or
environment-dependent factors may improve future cosmological analyses beyond
standard $x_{1}$ and $c$ cuts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01674v1" target="_blank"><h2>Understanding the Evolution of Black Hole Accretion and Dust out to z=4

sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are
extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE,
Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less
reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features
available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic

associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately
18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three
high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as
a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in
particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness
and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03519v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamically Controlled Transport of GeV Cosmic Rays in Diverse Galactic

TIGRESS magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium
(ISM). Our local disk patch models sample a wide range of gas surface
densities, gravitational potentials, and star formation rates (SFRs), and
include a spiral arm simulation. Our approach incorporates CR advection by the
background gas, streaming along the magnetic field limited by the local ion
Alfv\'en speed, and diffusion relative to the Alfv\'en wave frame, with the
diffusion coefficient set by the balance between streaming-driven Alfv\'en wave
excitation and damping mediated by local gas properties. We find that dynamical
transport mechanisms (streaming and advection) are almost solely responsible
for GeV CR transport in the extra-planar regions of galaxies, while diffusion
along the magnetic field dominates within the primarily-neutral ISM of galactic
disks. We develop a simple 1D predictive model for the CR pressure
$P_\mathrm{c}$, dependent only on injected CR flux and gas parameters. We
demonstrate that the CR transport efficiency increases with increasing SFR, and
provide a fit for the CR feedback yield
$\Upsilon_\mathrm{c}~\equiv~P_\mathrm{c}/\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ as a function of
$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$, the SFR surface density. We analyze lateral CR transport
within the galactic disk, showing that CRs propagate away from feedback regions
in spiral arms into interarm regions by a combination of gas advection and
field-aligned transport. Lastly, we develop an empirical subgrid model for the
CR scattering rate that captures the impacts of the multiphase ISM on CR
transport without the numerical burden of full simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01666v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy-halo internal alignments across cosmic time</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Agustina V.

of a central galaxy's major axis with the galaxy distribution and its internal
galaxy-halo shape alignment. In contrast, blue central galaxies typically
exhibit almost no alignment signal, owing to a stronger internal misalignment
with their halo. We investigated how the internal alignment between the
principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components evolves over time as a
function of the total mass of central galaxies at z=0. In particular, we aim to
understand why disk-dominated, blue central galaxies often show weak or absent
alignment signals with the galaxy distribution in their group and in the
larger-scale cosmic structure. We used data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 run and
selected a sample of bright central galaxies at z=0. We computed the principal
axes of the stellar and dark matter components, along with their angular
momenta, to obtain the various alignment angles analyzed in this study. Also,
we used the merger trees to determine the number of major mergers between z=20
and z=0, and to track their shapes along their main branch. We examined
secondary dependencies of the galaxy-halo alignment on properties such as color
and merger history. We analyzed how shape alignments relate to the dynamical
coupling between the angular momentum directions of the stellar and dark matter
components. The results show that massive centrals tend to align with the shape
of their inner halo, and they are typically red and have undergone numerous
mergers. Lower-mass red centrals, and those that have experienced many mergers
exhibit the strongest evolution toward alignment. Blue centrals, in contrast,
are more strongly influenced by the link between the stellar and dark matter
angular momenta, such that they evolve toward either alignment or misalignment
with both the shape and angular momentum of the inner halo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01988v1" target="_blank"><h2>Need for PRIMA to understand the nature and ISM physical conditions of

assembly of the most massive galaxies and their contribution to the stellar
mass and star formation rate densities at early epochs. Massive red sources
already in place at z > 2 to 3 have been found in deep Spitzer-IRAC and ALMA
surveys. They are often called optically and near-IR dark, or HST-dark, being
undetected even in the deepest HST frames. The submillimeter (i.e., ALMA)
detection of these sources confirms their high-z dusty nature: they are massive
(e.g., log(M*/Msun) > 10) and dusty star-forming galaxies with estimated
redshifts in the 2.5 to 7 range. They seem to lie mostly below the main
sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and show gas depletion times <1 Gyr.
Imaging with the PRIMA/PRIMAger instrument over the full 25 to 265 micron range
will allow us to characterize their still uncovered spectral energy
distributions between JWST and ALMA spectral windows, probing their dust
content and properties (e.g., temperature, mass), whereas spectroscopic
observations with FIRESS will be the key to investigate the nature of their
powering source (e.g., AGN or star formation) and to study the physics of their
ISM, by detecting and measuring fine structure lines in the mid- and far-IR

properties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and
their geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical
slope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of
~3300 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution
of stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and
evolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam
grism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST
photometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line
fluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We
find that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts,
becoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between
attenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar
mass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av.
We find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with
increasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are
shallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift
galaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous
studies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV
obscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by
as large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust
growth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of
high- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust
in high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in
supernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03152v1" target="_blank"><h2>Influence of supermassive primordial black holes on ultraviolet

galaxies (ULIRGs; infrared luminsoity $L_{\rm IR}>10^{12}\ L_\odot$) utilizing
the $\sim$11 years of photometry from the NEOWISE multi-epoch catalog of {\it
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} ({\it WISE}). We identify 30 variable
ULIRGs with statistically significant MIR variability. The variability is
observed on timescales of a few years, implying that the MIR-emitting regions
are compact ($\lesssim 1$ pc). The difference between maximum and minimum $W2$
(4.6 ${\rm \mu}$m) band luminosity ($\Delta L_{\rm W2}$) of the 30 variable
ULIRGs range from $\Delta L_{W2}$ = $7\times10^{42}$ to $5\times 10^{44}$ erg

$\Delta L_{W2}$ = $1\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, surpassing the MIR luminosity
{range} observed in known supernovae (SNe; $L_{\rm 3.6\ {\rm \mu m}}$ and
$L_{\rm 4.5\ {\rm \mu m}}$ < 10$^{42.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Therefore, the MIR
variabilities in these 25 ULIRGs are most likely driven by tidal disruption
events (TDEs) or intrinsic changes in their active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus
emission. Our sample includes hard X-ray detected AGNs (e.g., UGC 05101) and
previously reported TDE candidates (IRAS F01004-2237, IRAS 05189-2524). All 25
also exhibit at least one AGN signature(s) besides the MIR variability,
suggesting that even if the MIR variability originates from TDEs, the black
holes responsible are likely AGNs. Our results suggest that MIR variability is
an effective tool for detecting buried AGNs and highlights the intense nuclear

observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line
objects dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density
($\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than
UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity
function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black
hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\mathrm{bol}\gtrsim
10^{45-46}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright
end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able
to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest
LRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys
from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky
coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at
$z_\mathrm{phot}\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of
$n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\approx10^{-8}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10
times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity.
When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift
range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\lambda
L_{5100}\approx2.5\times10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover
occurs at $\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the
exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter
parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the
luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black
holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01653v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cascading from the winds to the disk: the universality of

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Star-forming galaxies are in a state of turbulence, with one of the principle
components of the turbulence sourced by the constant injection of momentum from
supernovae (SNe) explosions. Utilizing high-resolution stratified,
gravito-hydrodynamical models of SNe-driven turbulence with interstellar medium
(ISM) cooling and heating, we explore how SNe-driven turbulence changes across
different galactic conditions, parameterized by the galactic mass and
potential, SNe-driving rate, and seeding functions. We show that even though
the underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the
velocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic
energy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade,
$u^2(k) \propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode,
indicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant
changes in the ISM and SNe seeding. Moreover, the cascades connect smoothly
from the winds into the galactic disk, pushing the outer-scale of the
turbulence, $\ell_{\rm cor}$, to over $\ell_{\rm cor} \approx 6 \ell_0$, where
$\ell_0$ is the gaseous scale-height. By providing an analytical model for the
sound speed spectrum, $c_s^2(k)$, in the weak-cooling, adiabatic limit, we show
that it is the compressible turbulent modes, $u_c$, that control the
volume-filling phase structure of the galactic disks in our models, with
$c_s^2(k) \propto k^{-2} \propto u_c^2(k)$. This may indicate that galactic
turbulence does not only have highly-universal features across different
galaxies, but also directly sets the volume-filling hot and warm phase
structure of the underlying galactic ISM through turbulent compressible modes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02700v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hierarchical assembly impedes the inference of stellar mass growth

numbers of old stars (forming at z>7). Works inferring the star formation
histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that
the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the
well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else
indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these
studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of
observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models
like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller
galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of
stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use
the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy
masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I
demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to
significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e.
looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by
over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing
halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with
decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied
to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter
halo mass functions at high redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03027v1" target="_blank"><h2>A MUltiwavelength Study of ELAN Environments (AMUSE$^2$): The Impact of

nebulae at $z=2\sim3$, including two Enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe).
Through detection of mid-$J$ CO lines, we confirm physical associations of 15
SMGs, which are located outside the expected virial radii of the central
dark-matter halos hosting the quasars. We find $73^{+29}_{-21}\%$ of SMGs have
line profiles better described by double Gaussian models, with a median
peak-to-peak separation of 350 $\pm$ 25 km/s, suggesting rotating disks or
interacting pairs. Modified blackbody fits of the far-infrared photometry yield
a median $\beta$ of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.2 and $T_{dust}$ of 34 $\pm$ 3 K. Overall, SMGs
outside quasar halos share similar physical properties with those in the field,
but combining data from other studies reveals depleted gas fractions within
quasar halos. This suggests that dense environments significantly impact
massive star-forming galaxies only within halo scales at cosmic noon.
Additionally, spatial analyses of 15 SMGs indicate they trace large-scale
structures, possibly filamentary or elongated pancake-like, with a scale height
of 2-5\,cMpc. Our measured distributions and densities of star-formation rates
align with models, though likely represent lower limits.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02764v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust stripping in cluster galaxies: a PRIMA perspective</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alessandro Boselli, Marc Sauvage, Laure Ciesla</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> This paper is part of the JATIS special issue focused on the PRobe Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) probe mission concept.

the gravitational potential well of the massive host halo (ram pressure
stripping). Both gravitational perturbations and the external pressure exerted
by the hot ICM on the galaxy ISM during its high velocity journey within the
cluster are able to remove most, if not all of it, producing extended tails of
stripped material. Along with the different gas phases (cold atomic and
molecular, ionised, hot), these perturbations can remove also dust, thus
contributing to the pollution of the ICM. Probe Infrared Mission for
Astrophysics (PRIMA) is offering a unique opportunity to observe this dust
component, a crucial ingredient in the energetic balance of the stripped gas.
We analyse how the two instruments onboard of PRIMA, PRIMAger (in imaging and
polarimetric mode) and far-IR enhanced survey spectrometer (FIRESS), can be
used to observe a selected sample of ram pressure stripped tails detected at
other frequencies (HI, CO, Halpha, X-rays). These data can be used to determine
the relative distribution of the dust component with respect to that of the
other gas phases, derive its temperature, calculate different gas physical
parameters (electron density, photoelectric heating efficiency, gas
metallicity), and quantify the strength of the turbulent magnetic fields, all
fundamental parameters used to constrain the most recent hydrodynamic
simulations of gas stripping in clusters. The ultimate aim of this research is
that of understanding the fate of the cold stripped material once mixed with
the surrounding hot medium and study under which condition it can collapse into
giant molecular clouds (GMC) to form new stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02546v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemodynamics of BoötesI with $S^{5}$: Revised Velocity Gradient, Dark

dominated dwarf galaxies, this study investigates a simple mechanism by which
stellar cores can form as a result of DM halo expansion. Several non-CDM models
predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially
cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational
potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like
structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine
stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits
evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and
final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though
their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve
their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain
so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions.
Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar
density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do
not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones,
producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial
anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter "beta" grows from sim 0.07 at the
core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational
literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar
distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center. Given these
conditions, the mechanism predicts stellar cores with radii at least 40 % that
of the DM core and inner logarithmic slopes shallower than 0.6.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01690v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Impact of Baryonic Effects on the Dynamical Masses Inferred Using

and has been demonstrated to yield tight constraints on the galaxy-halo
connection. However, previous studies have assumed that the halos in which the
satellites orbit are composed solely of dark matter, neglecting the role of
baryons. Here, we develop an analytical model incorporating stars, gas, and the
adiabatic response of dark matter to assess the impact of baryonic effects on
the inference from satellite kinematics. The model covers halos in the mass
range $10^{12}-10^{15}M_\odot$ and is tuned to agree with well-established
observational scaling relations. In addition, the model uses simple functional
forms for the mass fractions of ejected baryons and diffuse halo stars,
calibrated to the median trends in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations. We
find that baryonic effects mainly result in a reduction of the satellite
line-of-sight velocity dispersion due to the ejection of baryons and the
resulting response of the dark matter halo. The effect is minimal (less than
1%) for the most massive halos, but reaches ~5-6% for halos in the mass range
$10^{12}-10^{13}M_\odot$, and up to 8% in extreme cases. We propose a simple
formalism for correcting the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion for
baryonic effects, and for marginalizing over the uncertainties. We integrate
this correction function into BASILISK, a Bayesian hierarchical inference
method applied to satellite kinematics data extracted from large redshift
surveys, and find that this shifts central galaxies to higher inferred halo
masses at fixed luminosity by up to ~0.3 dex. In a forthcoming work, we
demonstrate that these few-percent level baryonic effects can have a
non-negligible impact on the inference of cosmological parameters, motivating a
novel approach to constraining the efficiency of feedback processes associated
with galaxy formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02919v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low radio frequency detections of known pulsars and identification of

the Galactic Plane (GP) data release from the GaLactic and Extragalactic
All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey, a widefield
continuum radio survey covering the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range, at the
positions of known pulsars in the ATNF catalogue (version 2.6.2) that lie
within its sky coverage. We present the spectral energy distribution for 193
known pulsars located at |b| < 11deg. Notably, 106 of these represent the first
detections below 400 MHz. We also cross-match the GLEAM-X: GP compact source
catalogue with unassociated sources in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
catalogue, filtering for gamma-ray spectral and variability properties, as well
as coincidence with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We have identified 106
possible pulsar candidates. This work demonstrates the importance of sensitive,
low-frequency Galactic plane surveys for detecting emission from known pulsars
and presents a potential way of searching for new pulsar candidates that would
otherwise be missed by traditional time-domain searches.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02092v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterization of a sample of $γ$-ray active galactic nuclei</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alberto Ulgiati, Paolo Padovani, Paolo Giommi, Simona Paiano, Ciro Pinto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 5 tables, Accepted</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract), quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyse 77 \textit{Fermi} sources and their potential low-energy

classified as active galactic nuclei, mainly blazars, based on optical
spectroscopy. The main goals of this work are to examine these associations,
classify the blazars based on their multi-wavelength spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), and identify potential masquerading BL Lac objects.
Through SED analysis, we assess whether the multi-wavelength emission follows
the characteristic double-peaked curve of blazars. Additionally, we propose the
region of origin of the emission at different wavelengths, investigate the
correlation between $\gamma$-ray and lower-energy emission, and classify
objects as low-, intermediate-, high- or extreme high synchrotron peaked (LSP,
ISP, HSP, E-HSP) blazars. We search for masquerading BL Lacs, a class of
flat-spectrum radio quasars where broad emission lines are swamped by
non-thermal jet emission. The multi-wavelength analysis revealed that the 64
radio-loud sources in our sample exhibit an SED with a double-peak structure,
typically ascribed to jet activity. Based on the synchrotron peak, 46 are HSP,
11 as ISP, and 7 as LSP. We also found 9--18 masquerading BL Lac candidates
($\approx$15--30\% of the radio-loud sample). For the 13 radio-quiet UGSs, the
SEDs do not exhibit the double-peak structure typical of jetted AGN. Further
analysis ruled out star formation as the origin of the observed $\gamma$-ray
emission, making its reconciliation with lower-energy emission challenging. We
explored alternative counterparts, identifying low-energy matches for 7
sources, with no plausible counterparts found for the others.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02690v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Interstellar Medium in I Zw 18 seen with JWST/MIRI: II. Warm

investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in $\sim
120$ pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2
rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2
population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and
models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios
(OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR,
we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local
thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically,
this is the first time that OPR significantly $> 3$ has been measured in
interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column
density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing
photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon
densities of $\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and an interstellar radiation field scaling
factor, G0, of $\sim 10^3$. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same
highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T $\geq 50$K dust
is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14
$\mu$m; possible identification as Al$_2$O$_3$ is discussed. The continuum
emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the

kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies to $m > 3 \times
10^{-19}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This constraint, which excludes the "fuzzy" range of
ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of
the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear
perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative
calculation to full Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star
particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that
FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of
a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations,
and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are
indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by
possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal
radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show
that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM
self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale
structure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major
III/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the
lower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m > 8 \times
10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence. This constraint could further be
strengthened considerably by more precise measurements of the size and velocity
dispersion of this and other similar galaxies, and by using full
Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01803v1" target="_blank"><h2>Relating spatially resolved optical attenuation, dust and gas in nearby

$A_{V\mathrm{,BD}}$, and by the SED-fitting, $A_{V\mathrm{,SED}}$, to the dust
distribution and gas surface density throughout the disc of galaxies, down to
scales smaller than 0.5 kpc. We investigate five nearby star-forming spirals
with available FUV to sub-mm observations, along with atomic and molecular gas
surface density maps and optical integral-field spectroscopic data. We use the
CIGALE SED-fitting code to map the dust mass surface density
($\Sigma_\mathrm{dust}$) and $A_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$ of different stellar
populations. For each pixel, we independently estimate the attenuation from the
BD.
  We find that both $\Sigma _\mathrm{dust}$ and $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ trace
better the molecular and total gas mass surface density, rather than the atomic
gas. Since regions sampled in this study have high molecular fractions, atomic
gas surface densities, indicative of molecular gas shielding layers, decrease
as the mean dust-to-gas ratio increases from galaxy to galaxy. The fitted
attenuation towards young stars, $A^\mathrm{young}_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$, is in
good agreement with $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ and it can then be used to trace the
attenuation in star forming galaxies where integral-field observations are not
available. We estimate the ratio of $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ over the total stellar
$A_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$ and find it slightly larger than what has been found in
previous studies. Finally, we investigate which dust distribution reproduces
better the estimated $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ and $A_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$. We find that
the attenuation towards old stars is consistent with the expectations for a
standard galactic disc, where the stellar and dust distributions are mixed,
while $A_{V, \mathrm{BD}}$ and the $A^\mathrm{young}_{V, \mathrm{SED}}$ are
between the values expected for a foreground dust screen and a mixed

large-scale structures that they inhabit. Theory suggests that galaxies acquire
angular momentum during the linear stage of structure formation, and hence
predict alignments between the spin of halos and the nearby structures of the
cosmic web. In this study, we use the largest catalog of galaxies publicly
available - the Siena Galaxy Atlas - to study the alignment of the spin normals
of elliptical and spiral galaxies with filaments constructed by applying the
Bisous process on galaxies ($z \le$ 0.2) from SDSS - DR12. Our sample comprises
32517 disk and 18955 elliptical galaxies that are within 2 Mpc of any filament
spine. We find that the spin normals of elliptical galaxies exhibit a strong
perpendicular alignment with respect to the orientation of the host filaments,
inconsistent with random distributions by up to $\approx$ 13 $\sigma$. The spin
axis of spiral galaxies shows a much weaker but nonzero alignment signal with
their host filaments of $ \approx$ 2.8$\sigma$ when compared with random. These
numbers depend on exactly how the significance is measured, as elucidated in
the text. Furthermore, the significance of the alignment signal is examined as
a function of distance from the filament spine. Spiral galaxies reach a maximum
signal between 0.5 and 1 Mpc. elliptical galaxies reach their maximum
significance between 0.2 and 0.5 Mpc. We also note that with a tailored
selection of galaxies, as a function of both i) distance from the filaments \&
as a ii) function of absolute luminosity, the alignment significance can be
maximized.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02067v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measuring metal sulfides in interstellar dust with PRIMA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Izaskun Jiménez-Serra, Shaoshan Zeng, Yao-Lun Yang, Angèle Taillard, Marta Rey-Montejo, Laura Colzi, Nami Sakai, Asunción Fuente</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> This paper is part of the JATIS special issue focused on the PRobe Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) probe mission concept.

to the denser regimes of the interstellar medium in molecular clouds. The form
in which sulfur gets depleted onto dust grains, however, remains a mystery. One
possibility is that sulfur gets locked in interstellar dust in the form of
sulfide minerals. Recently, metal sulfides such as NaS and MgS have been
detected in a shocked molecular cloud in the Galactic Center, suggesting that
these molecules could represent an important reservoir of sulfur in dust
grains. In this contribution, we discuss the prospect of observing metal
sulfides such as MgS and FeS in absorption experiments carried out with the
FIRESS instrument onboard PRIMA using its low resolution observing mode. Our
estimates show that the molecular bands of MgS and FeS found between 20 and 50
${\mu}$m could be detected in absorption with S/N ${\geq}$ 5 for sources
brighter than 200 mJy in just 1 h of observing time against low-mass
protostellar objects. This science case, therefore, has the potential to unveil
the main reservoir of sulfur in interstellar dust, constraining in what form
sulfur is incorporated into minor bodies of our solar system.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01692v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PRIMA promise of deciphering interstellar dust evolution with

electron temperatures from five different auroral lines: [NII]~$\lambda$5755,
[OII]~$\lambda\lambda$7319,30, [SII]~$\lambda\lambda$4069,76,

population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of
galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are
used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large
enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass
haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect
on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark
matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per
cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations.
We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its
parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects
two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual
objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the
population is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available
constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our
experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in
the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly
degenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with
individual subhaloes. This further highlights the need for better understanding
of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information
can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01740v1" target="_blank"><h2>FEAST: JWST/NIRCam view of the Resolved Stellar Populations of the

Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program. NGC 4485 and
NGC 4490 form the closest known pair of interacting late-type dwarf galaxies
(at $\sim 7.4$ Mpc), excluding the Magellanic Clouds. Near-infrared
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reveal a wide range of stellar populations in
both galaxies, including young ($\lesssim 200$ Myr) upper main sequence stars,
core helium-burning stars, and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.
We also identify intermediate-age ($\sim 200$ Myr -- $1$ Gyr) carbon-rich AGB
stars and a well-populated old ($\gtrsim 1$ Gyr) red giant branch (RGB). The
CMDs show two distinct bursts of star formation beginning $\sim 30$ Myr and
$\sim 200$ Myr ago, the latter consistent with the most recent pericenter
passage predicted by N-body simulations. The spatial distribution of stars
reveals a tidal bridge extending from NGC 4485 and connecting to the disk of
NGC 4490. Compact star-forming regions are seen along NGC 4490's spiral arms,
possibly originating from its infrared nucleus. A significant metallicity
gradient is observed in the young stellar populations forming the bridge. These
findings suggest that during the last pericenter passage, gas was stripped from
NGC 4485 via tidal forces or ram pressure, accreted by NGC 4490, and mixed with
in-situ material, fueling ongoing star formation. This system provides a unique
nearby laboratory for studying how tidal interactions shape the star formation
and chemical enrichment history of dwarf galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01307v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the resolved K-S relation in nearby galaxies: Insights from UVIT

the molecular gas mass surface density (Sigma H2) in the high-density central
regions of three nearby barred spiral galaxies hosting AGN: NGC 1365, NGC 1433,

imaging and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for CO(2-1)
molecular gas mapping, we explore recent star formation and gas distribution
with a spatial resolution of about 120 to 132 pc. Our findings reveal a
sublinear rKS law, with slopes ranging from about 0.17 to 0.71. Notably, NGC
1566 exhibits a robust rKS relation consistent with previous studies, while NGC
1365 and NGC 1433 show weaker correlations. These differences are likely due to
the smaller number of identified star-forming regions in these galaxies
compared to NGC 1566, as well as the central molecular gas concentrations and
varying star formation activity in their bars and nuclear regions. These
results also support the idea that the rKS relation deviates from linearity in
extreme environments, such as starburst galaxies and galactic centres.
Additionally, we find a generally low median star formation efficiency (SFE)
within the bars of these galaxies, suggesting that while bars may drive nuclear
starbursts and contribute to bulge growth, they do not significantly increase
SFE. Furthermore, a negative correlation between SFE and Sigma H2 is observed
across the sample, both within and outside the bar regions, suggesting that
higher Sigma H2 may lead to lower SFE in the central regions of these galaxies.
Our findings highlight that Sigma H2 plays a primary role in shaping the
observed trends in SFE, rather than the presence of a bar itself.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02414v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disentangling Target Lines from Interlopers and Continuum with Neural

measuring fluctuations in aggregate line emission from unresolved galaxies and
the intergalactic medium, providing a powerful probe of both astrophysics and
cosmology. However, interpreting LIM data is limited by our ability to
disentangle the signal of a target spectral line from continuum emission and
interloper lines, which are emissions from other redshifts that fall within the
observed frequency band. Astrophysical modeling uncertainties further
complicate matters, leaving the relative amplitudes of the map components
poorly understood. In this paper, we present a neural-network (NN) approach to
separate the three map components at the level of the angular power spectrum,
explicitly accounting for uncertainties in their relative amplitudes. As test
cases, we generate SPHEREx-like maps with variable interloper line luminosities
across multiple frequency channels, with and without pixel-wise scatter and
continuum contributions. We find that cross-channel correlations are essential
for robust NN performance when scatter is present. The NN exhibits a hierarchy
in residual errors: brighter components yield smaller residuals, and the
dimmest the highest. Without continuum emission, the network recovers the
target power spectrum to within $2.5\%$, while partially correcting the
interloper spectra. With continuum included, the NN accurately reconstructs the
power spectra of the continuum and target line, within $2\%$ and $6\%$,
respectively, but fails to recover those of the interlopers. Reducing
pixel-level scatter further improves performance, lowering residual errors to

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), stellar mass function (title, abstract), quiescent galaxies (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Aims. We derive the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming
galaxies at z <= 0.2 using 12-band optical photometry from the third data
release (DR3) of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) over
3,284 deg^2. Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r <= 20 mag
and photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 <= z <= 0.20. Stellar masses and
star formation rates were derived through spectral energy distribution fitting
with CIGALE, confronted with spectroscopic samples. Galaxies are classified as
star-forming or quiescent based on their specific star formation rate (sSFR),
adopting log(sSFR [yr^-1]) = -10.2. We compute SMFs for both populations using
the 1/Vmax method, apply completeness corrections, and fit Schechter functions.
Results. The SMFs from J-PLUS DR3 are well described by Schechter functions and
agree with previous photometric and spectroscopic studies. The characteristic
mass for quiescent galaxies, log(M*/Msun) = 10.80, is 0.4 dex larger than that
of star-forming galaxies. The faint-end slope is steeper for star-forming
galaxies (alpha = -1.2) than for quiescent ones (alpha = -0.7). The quiescent
fraction rises by 40 percent per dex in stellar mass, reaching fQ > 0.95 at
log(M*/Msun) > 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an
excess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3
stellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the
literature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models.
Quiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) > 9,
but 75 percent of stellar mass density. The use of 12 optical bands, including
7 narrow filters, improves redshift precision by 20 percent, enabling more
accurate SED fitting and galaxy classification.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03153v1" target="_blank"><h2>A comprehensive catalogue of OB cluster candidates in M31 and their

Andromeda galaxy (M31), identified using a MeanShift-based algorithm on HST's
F275W-band imaging from the PHAT (Dalcanton et al. 2012) and PHAST (Chen et al.
2025) Hubble surveys. These clusters exhibit typical half-light radii of 1-2 pc
and strong ultraviolet luminosities indicative of recent massive star
formation. Spatial analysis reveals a pronounced north-south asymmetry:
clusters in the northern disc show tight associations with giant molecular
clouds (GMCs), while southern clusters appear more compact and luminous but
less correlated with molecular gas. Two-point correlation functions demonstrate
significant clustering of OBC candidates on scales 100 pc and a strong spatial
association with GMCs, consistent with hierarchical star formation in dense
gas-rich environments. These findings offer new constraints on the early
evolution and feedback-driven dispersal of young stellar clusters across
galactic discs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02847v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transforming galaxies with EASE: widespread structural changes enabled
  by short-lived spirals</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Arjen van der Wel, Sharon E. Meidt</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose that galaxy structural changes - and the rapid rise of a
population of galaxies with early-type morphologies at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$) -
can be explained with EASE: Early, Accelerated, Secular Evolution. The
mechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type
galaxies that are present and active at $z>1.5$ as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The
process is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes
(heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many ($\approx10-30$) orbital
periods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than
at the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as
a proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and
properties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields,
show that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than
late-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE
relies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which
transience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic
wave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady
open spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open,
transient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a
dynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical
steady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular
momentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals
a more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals
in star-forming galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$ across the redshifts
where early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play
an important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03364v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extending the simulations of intermediate-mass black hole mass

\approx 10^3-10^6 M_odot$) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) remains uncertain
because the limited number of verified instances within the local Universe,
limited within 3.5 Mpc. They are crucial for our understanding about the
formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The upcoming
Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) promises to revolutionize the detection of
these mysterious objects. In this study, we simulated the kinematics of an IMBH
within the nuclear star cluster of VCC 1861, one of the faintest galaxies in
the Virgo Cluster. Using Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) and stellar density
profiles derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and the HSIM program,
we created mock High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared
Integral field spectrograph (HARMONI) observations for the ELT. We then extract
stellar kinematics from these mock data and recover the BH mass using the JAM
model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. Our results demonstrate
the ELT's capability to detect IMBHs with masses comprising 5% of the NSC's
mass at the distance of the Virgo Cluster.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02741v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impact of Uncertainties in Spectral Energy Distribution Modelling on

spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, yet uncertainties in key model
ingredients are often overlooked. By leveraging a $z\sim0$ galaxy sample from
the EAGLE simulation, we generate synthetic SDSS spectral and VISTA photometric
observations with controlled assumptions, to assess how variations in stellar
spectral library, initial mass function (IMF) and metallicity prescriptions
within the BPASS-framework affect inferred galaxy properties. Our analysis
combines spectral fitting from 3800 to 9200 A with photometric constraints
extending to 2.3 $\mu$m, enabling robust assessment across a broad wavelength
baseline. Our findings reveal mass, age and star formation rate vary by
$0.27\pm0.09$, $0.19\pm0.11$ and $1.4\pm1.0$ dex, respectively, greater than
observational uncertainties reported in surveys. Notably, we find stellar
spectral library choice is capable of transforming a galaxy from appearing
star-forming to quiescent, while a fixed metallicity assumption yields
systematic biases when the chosen metallicity is incorrect. These modelling
differences impact the reconstructed total mass assembly history in galaxies by
up to $\sim12$ percent and bias the demographic and star formation history
conclusions drawn from surveys. As upcoming missions like Euclid, Roman and
CASTOR aim to characterise galaxy evolution with unprecedented precision, our
results highlight the need for careful propagation of SED modelling
uncertainties and transparency in model selection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03039v1" target="_blank"><h2>Machine Learning Classification of COSMOS2020 Galaxies: Quiescent vs.

essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive
and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to
develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to
identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020
catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz
semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the
CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric
bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set
and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score,
and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data,
injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 < 26 AB) along
with a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 3.5 to align the simulated and observational
datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\% for quiescent galaxies,
significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML
model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable
precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a
systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins
within 0.2 < z < 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and
SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can
effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable
insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification
catalog are publicly available.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03466v1" target="_blank"><h2>VLA FRAMEx. III. Circumnuclear Radio Emission Mechanisms in Hard X-ray

($<40~\rm{Mpc}$) of hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using
$4-12$ GHz observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). All of
the 25 sources analyzed here have previously been observed with the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) to probe their subparsec projected physical scales, but
detected emission has only been measured for 12 of the sources at $C$ band (4.4
GHz), despite expectations. We determined that coronal emission is unlikely to
be a dominant emission mechanism for the sources not detected by the VLBA, and
the emission measured with the VLA is likely produced beyond parsec spatial
scales. We also explore potential radiation mechanisms for the circumnuclear
radio emission that is produced beyond the observable ~parsec physical scales
probed with the VLBA but within the $\leq30-110$ parsec spatial scales observed
with the VLA. From an energetics perspective, we find that all targets have
extranuclear radio emission that is compatible with AGN winds, assuming a
maximum of 10% of the bolometric output can supply the mechanical energy
observed. We also find that the excess emission is likely too strong for star
formation alone when compared to results from optical spectroscopy, but may
contribute in smaller capacities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02533v1" target="_blank"><h2>PRIMA Vista: far-infrared polarimetry to unveil small-scale

To be published in JATIS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Magnetic fields are a fundamental part of the interstellar medium (ISM) and
remain a challenge for building a comprehensive understanding of galactic
properties. Their study requires far-infrared polarimetric observations, which
provide an unrivaled probe of the dynamics, magnetization, and structure of the
coldest and densest interstellar gas and dust at small scales in galaxies,
where mass and star formation reside. We use high-resolution
magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a face-on Milky Way-like galaxy and show
that the alignment of magnetic fields with ISM structures and the turbulence at
100 pc scales decrease with increasing magnetization. We make predictions for
extragalactic observations by the proposed PRobefarInfrared Mission for
Astrophysics (PRIMA) telescope, comparing them with Stratospheric Observatory
For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) observations similar to those of the Survey of
extragALactic magnetiSm with SOFIA (SALSA). PRIMA will be able to better
measure magnetic alignment trends inaccessible by SOFIA. We find that PRIMA
will better sample magnetic turbulence, especially in dense environments, and
will be able to measure the unresolved intrinsic magnetic field orientations to
approximately 6 deg precision. PRIMA will also be capable of resolving
observables such as the polarized fraction or the magnetic alignment down to
scales comparable to the resolution of our simulations (about 10 pc) for
galaxies up to 0.5 Mpc away. The polarization-dispersion relation shows that
PRIMA observations will suffer from significantly reduced beam depolarization.
Furthermore, PRIMA will recover the correlation between increasing the magnetic
alignment parameter and local polarization fraction. Overall, observations of
local galaxies with PRIMA will better characterize interstellar magnetism and
constrain ISM and galaxy models, advancing our understanding of magnetism in
the universe.</p></br></body>
