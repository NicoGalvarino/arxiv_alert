One open
question is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift,
radio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving
ionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies
have investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our
main goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with
moderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in
observations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed
in earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at
comparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the
literature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure
in our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649
aligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a
jet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we
found that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial
scales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas
present small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that
the kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by
outflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and
ionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic
considerations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a
significant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low
redshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot
rule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the
interstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14183v1" target="_blank"><h2>Molecular gas content of gravitational-lensed quasars at cosmic noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhiyuan Zheng, Yong Shi, Qiusheng Gu, Zhi-Yu Zhang, Junzhi Wang, Yanmei Chen, Fuyan Bian</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), molecular gas (title, abstract), quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Star-forming activity in the host galaxies of high-redshift quasars is
crucial to understanding the connection between supermassive black hole (SMBH)
activity and galaxy evolution. While most existing studies are biased toward
luminous quasars, we conduct carbon monoxide (CO) observations of 17
gravitationally lensed quasars that have four images using the IRAM 30m
telescope to investigate the molecular gas content of moderate- to
low-luminosity quasars. CO emissions are detected in five out of 17 quasars,
corresponding to a detection rate of about 30\%. Analysis of their star
formation activity reveals that these quasars live in gas-rich environments but
exhibit weaker starbursts and lower star formation efficiencies compared to
other luminous high-redshift quasars. In addition, the CO spectral line energy
distributions of the two quasars (SDSS J0924+0219, SDSS J1330+1810) are also
consistent with mild star formation instead of extreme starbursts. These
results suggest that these lensed quasars reside in weaker starburst
environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14908v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fermi Bubbles Without AGN: Gamma-Ray Bubbles in MHD Galaxy Formation

conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can
form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and
dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins
to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion
decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering.
We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass
simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray
spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and
hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux
from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the
measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict
multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially
providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic
medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13959v1" target="_blank"><h2>Strong Evidence for Cosmic Ray-Supported $\sim$L$^{\ast}$ Galaxy Halos

Comments and questions most welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract), AGN feedback (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Many state-of-the-art galaxy simulations featuring traditional feedback modes
have significant challenges producing enough extended soft X-ray ($\sim 0.5-2$
keV) emission at R $\sim 0.5-1$ R$_{\rm vir}$ observed around galaxies with
stellar masses M$_{\rm \ast} \lesssim 10^{11} \rm M_\odot$, without violating
galaxy mass function constraints. Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)
measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is
orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and
many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be
met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of
cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR
leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the
CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the
pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone -- if these novel tSZ and
X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they
reveal \textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}.
Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional
thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ
signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ \& X-rays
together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure
relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and
AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently
observed constraints at M$_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{\rm 12} \rm M_\odot$ imply the
halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14667v1" target="_blank"><h2>Active galactic nucleus outflows accelerate when they escape the bulge</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kastytis Zubovas, Matas Tartėnas</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title, abstract), outflow (title, abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Large-scale outflows driven by AGNs are an important element of galaxy
evolution. Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the
activity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of
the host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of
outflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately
constant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\rm
tr} \sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven
outflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to
expand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical
code to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a
constant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite
bulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free
parameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles,
variations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of
outflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles
essentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density
profile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves
the fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they
accelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of
significant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of
outflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can
explain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The
free parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable
ranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the
true conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14182v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quasi-periodic oscillations in optical color evolutions to support
  sub-pc binary black hole systems in broad line active galactic nuclei</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhang XueGuang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to be published in A&A Letters</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract), AGN variability (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with periodicity around hundreds
to thousands of days have been accepted as an efficient indicator for sub-pc
binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN).
However, considering intrinsic variability (red noises) of BLAGN, it is still
an open question on physical origin of detected optical QPOs from AGN
variability or truly from sub-pc BBHs. Here, a simple method is proposed to
support optical QPOs related to sub-pc BBHs by detecting QPOs in time dependent
optical color evolutions of BLAGN. Periodic variations of obscurations are
expected on optical light curves related to sub-pc BBHs, but there should be
non-periodic variable obscurations on optical light curves in normal BLAGN.
Through simulated optical light curves for intrinsic AGN variability by
Continuous AutoRegressive process with time durations around 2800days (similar
as time durations of light curves in ZTF), the probability is definitely
smaller than $3.3\times10^{-7}$ that QPOs can be detected in the corresponding
optical color evolutions, but about $3.1\times10^{-2}$ that optical QPOs with
periodicity smaller than 1400days (at least two cycles) can be detected in the
simulated single-band light curves. Therefore, confidence level is definitely
higher than 5$\sigma$ to support the QPOs in color evolutions not related to
intrinsic AGN variability but truly related to sub-pc BBHs. In the near future,
the proposed method can be applied for searching reliable optical QPOs in BLAGN
through multi-band light curves from the ZTF and the upcoming LSST.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14529v1" target="_blank"><h2>The variability of active galaxies: I. Broad-band noise X-ray power

of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show
dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The
power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law
that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high
frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the
mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the
`X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly
sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous
paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power
law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56
variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the
$0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends
in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We
also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We
update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements
spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends
in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H
1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13952v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modelling the nebular emission of galaxies across cosmic time with COLT</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  William McClymont, Aaron Smith, Sandro Tacchella</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 11 figures, to be submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), ISM (abstract), CGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extragalactic nebular emission has long been a workhorse probe of the
processes driving galaxy evolution, but the richness of JWST spectroscopy has
shifted the bottleneck from data acquisition to physical interpretation and
modelling. In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular
line and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal
equilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver
and radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately
balancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination,
collisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling,
free-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where
non-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling
prescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures
in the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the
interstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the
equilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously
excessive lukewarm ($T=10^3-10^4$K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and
cold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement
a level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate
cooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines,
together with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from
free-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to
the high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line
ratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular
emission across cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13719v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Stellar Morphology & Size of X-ray-selected Active Galactic Nuclei

axis-ratio, Gini-$M_{20}$ parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between
redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass $\log M_s\sim 10.75$. We find that AGN host

(SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have
similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for
the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host
galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1$\mu
m$ stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed
a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to
disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with
evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due
to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14829v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Launching of Galactic Winds from a Multiphase ISM</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fernando Hidalgo-Pineda, Max Gronke, Philipp Grete</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 14 figures + appendix. Submitted for review to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), ISM (title, abstract), feedback (abstract), IGM (abstract), LLS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galactic outflows are a key agent of galaxy evolution, yet their observed
multiphase nature remains difficult to reconcile with theoretical models, which
often fail to explain how cold gas survives interactions with hot, fast winds.
We present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows
interacting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its
cold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\rm ISM}$, and clump size
$r_{\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\rm ISM}
\gtrsim r_{\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition
($r_{\rm cl} > r_{\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across
diverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\rm cl}/r_{\rm
crit} \sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the
initial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum
following Zipf's law ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}m \propto m^{-2}$), implying that
turbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase
outflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\sim \chi
r_{\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The
interaction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both
phases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov
scaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions
reach $\sigma \sim c_{\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas
approaches unity even for $f_v \sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling
fraction stays low, explaining the "misty" appearance of observed outflows.
Together, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to
galaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting
observations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale
simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14715v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE (I): Forward Shock</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Guobin Mou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent long-term radio monitoring of tidal disruption events (TDEs) suggests
that radio afterglows are common. Most studies argue that these afterglows may
arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE
outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical
models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which
introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study
the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the
synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with
non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are
explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a
Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance
of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early
times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of
the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline
pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are
clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred
from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly
from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those
from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13737v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparing subgrid models for cosmic ray diffusion in a magnetized

evolution by altering gas dynamics and chemistry across multiple scales.
Typical numerical simulations of CR transport assume a constant diffusion
coefficient for the entire galaxy, despite both numerical and theoretical
studies showing that it can change by orders of magnitude depending on the
phase of the interstellar medium. Only a few simulations exist that
self-consistently calculate CR transport with diffusion, streaming, and
advection by the background gas. In this study we explore three subgrid models
for CR diffusion, based on popular theories of CR transport. We post-process an
isolated, star-forming MHD galactic disk simulated using the RAMSES code. The
resulting diffusion coefficients depend solely on the subgrid turbulent kinetic
energy and the MHD state variables of the plasma. We use these models to
calculate coefficients for vertical transport. We find that they depend
critically on the local magnetic field tilt angle. Across models, our resulting
diffusion coefficients range from $10^{26}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$ to $10^{31}~\rm
cm^2s^{-1}$, and yield CR energy densities at the midplane from $1$ to $100
~\rm eV cm^{-3}$, suggesting varied degrees of backreaction on their
environment. Using simple approximations, we show that the gamma ray luminosity
of the galaxy depends primarily on the gas surface density and the turbulent
confinement of CRs by the galactic corona.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13604v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark

the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass
accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down
and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane.
Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin
correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much
larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely
independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated
spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of

critical environments for studying feedback mechanisms from star formation and
its impacts on dwarf galaxy evolution. In particular, radio continuum (RC)
observations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a
significant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the
detectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15
dwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs)
spanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using
multi-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact
Array, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and
explore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is
detected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission
correlates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass,
while dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no
significant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that
the RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a
simple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more
complex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms
that a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral
shapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches.
Additionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic
ray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can
escape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14059v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Helium Reionization Through the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ Hyperfine

temperature and analyze its evolution. Our results show that the
volume-averaged brightness temperature declines rapidly from $\sim 1 \mu$K at
$z = 4$ to $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \mu$K by $z = 2.3$, tracing the HeII to
HeIII transition driven by quasars. The power spectrum of the 3.5cm signal
exhibits a scale-dependent evolution, peaking on small scales and declining as
reionization progresses. We explore the cross-correlation of the 3.5cm
transition line with the distribution of AGNs, which shows a transition from
positive to negative correlation as ionized regions grow. We also examine the
3.5cm forest and demonstrate that absorption features persist down to $z \sim
2.90$, even when more than $85\%$ of HeII is ionized. Although current
observational upper limits lie several orders of magnitude above theoretical
predictions, future radio arrays such as $\mathrm{SKA-mid}$ offer promising
prospects. Overall, this study highlights the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ hyperfine
transition as a sensitive tracer of the thermal and ionization history of the
IGM during helium reionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14820v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring a cosmic ray inverse-Compton origin to the SZ-to-X-ray
  pressure deficit in the cool core cluster ZwCl 3146</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Emily M. Silich, Jack Sayers, Philip F.

microwave background photons by $\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the
central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a
non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as
intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is
particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation
relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC
system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only
thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the
X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\simeq30\%$ decrement
in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical
significance of $\simeq 3.3\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from
CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection.
X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC
emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test
alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement,
with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality.
Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$
decrement $\gtrsim10\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC
emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of
larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is
relevant to the cooling flow problem.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13240v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of red galaxy candidates at z ~ 12: Early dust growth or

slopes (betaUV ~> -1.5), and probe the origin of such colors at cosmic dawn.
From Prospector fits to the UNCOVER/MegaScience dataset -- deep JWST/NIRCam
imaging of Abell 2744 in 20 broad- and medium-bands -- we identify several new
z > 10 galaxies. Medium-band data improve redshift estimates, revealing two
lensed (mu ~ 3.3) z ~ 12 galaxies in a close pair with beta_UV ~> -1.5 at an UV
absolute magnitude of M_UV ~ -19 mag, lying away from typical scatter on
previously known MUV-betaUV relations. SED fitting with Prospector, Bagpipes,
and EAZY support their high-z nature, with probability of low-z interlopers of
p(z < 7) < 10%. The potential low-z interlopers are z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies
(QGs), but unexpected to be detected at the given field of view unless z ~ 3 QG
stellar mass function has a strong turn up at log Mstar/Msun ~ 9. Unlike
typical blue high-redshift candidates (beta_UV ~< -2.0), these red slopes
require either dust or nebular continuum reddening. The dust scenario implies
Av ~ 0.8 mag, which is larger than theoretical predictions, but is consistent
with a dust-to-stellar mass ratio (log M_dust/M_star ~ -3). The nebular
scenario demands dense gas (log nH /cm^3 ~ 4.0) around hot stars (log Teff [K]
~ 4.9). Spectroscopic follow-up is essential to determine their true nature and
reveal missing galaxies at the cosmic dawn.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13977v1" target="_blank"><h2>The THESAN-ZOOM project: The Hidden Neighbours of OI Absorbers during
  Reionization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Giulia Pruto, Laura Keating, Rahul Kannan, Ewald Puchwein, Aaron Smith, Josh Borrow, Enrico Garaldi, Mark Vogelsberger, Oliver Zier, William McClymont, Xuejian Shen, Sandro Tacchella</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 15 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), JWST (abstract), feedback (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract), halo (abstract), haloes (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and
reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results
showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher
redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of
the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be
surrounded by low-mass faint sources that fall below the detection threshold of
current instruments. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations
to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI)
absorbers and galaxies within the redshift range $z = 5 - 8$. We find that the
circumgalactic medium of galaxies becomes progressively ionised with cosmic
time, leading to a decrease of $\approx 0.2$ in the covering fraction of
neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. The
observable absorbers ($N_{\rm OI} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) are not
confined to haloes: at $z \geq 5$ the majority ($\gtrsim 60\%$) arise beyond
$R_{\rm{vir}}$, and including these systems is essential to reproduce the
observed increase in absorber incidence with redshift. The simulated absorbers
preferentially reside in overdensities rich in low-mass galaxies ($M_\star \leq
10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot$), explaining the scarcity of detected counterparts, while
not excluding the possibility of nearby star-forming sources ($\geq
5\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$) similar to those suggested by the latest
ALMA observations and, at larger distances, by the JWST. These results
establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation
structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic
surveys.</p></br></body>
