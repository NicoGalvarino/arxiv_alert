and thermal feedback from AGN onto the evolution of Seyfert-type galaxies,
studying the morphology of central galaxies growing within dark matter (DM)
halos with masses logM/Mo ~11.8 at z=0. In Paper I, we focused on the end
products at z=0, here we analyze evolution for z<10. Black holes (SMBHs) of
~10^6 Mo were seeded at z~9.1 and z~3.7, producing jets along their spin axes.
Obtained SMBH accretion rates vary in the range ~0.3-10^(-4) of the Eddington
rate. We compared the basic properties of galaxies, such as star formation
rate, masses, gas and stellar fractions, bulge-to-disk mass ratios, SMBH
masses, etc., over the range of redshifts. Our results indicate that jets and
associated over-pressured bubbles have substantial effects on Seyfert galaxy
evolution, including properties of the interstellar and circumgalactic medium
(ISM and CGM), and even beyond. This feedback can suppress and even quench star
formation, reduce stellar mass and gas fraction, modify the bulge-to-disk
ratios, drive outflows from galaxies and host DM halos, and metal-enrich the
CGM. The jets are largely but not exclusively contained within galaxies.
However, over-pressured bubbles cross and modify the composition of the CGM and
IGM, their thermodynamic and dynamic state, and generate vorticity. The CGM
emerges as a complex region, where action of galactic outflows and jet-formed
bubbles combines with the influx from cosmological filaments and diffuse
accretion. Ultimately, the above processes affect the gas balance within the
galaxy, its morphology, and gas supply to the SMBH, limiting its growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13540v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark matter annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud and its

Cloud (LMC) and the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the
Milky Way (MW) halo, using a MW-LMC analogue from the Auriga
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the gamma-ray signals from DM
annihilation from the LMC rises above the MW foreground by a factor of greater
than 100 for the s-wave velocity-independent annihilation model, as well as for
the Sommerfeld, p-wave, and d-wave velocity-dependent models. We derive upper
limits on the annihilation cross section of DM particles in the LMC using
Fermi-LAT data for all velocity-dependent cross section models. Bounds for
d-wave annihilation are more stringent by $\sim 4-6$ orders of magnitude
relative to previous bounds from dwarf galaxies, and for p-wave emission our
bounds are $\sim 2-3$ orders of magnitude more stringent. We also demonstrate
that the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the MW halo is
greatest for the p-wave and d-wave models towards the outer MW halo, while the
impact is minimal for Sommerfeld and s-wave models. The LMC boosts the DM
density and velocity distribution in the outer MW halo, both by bringing in
high-speed DM particles and by accelerating the DM particles of the MW,
affecting the DM annihilation signals from the MW for the p-wave and d-wave
models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13911v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially resolved broad line region in a quasar at z=4: Dynamical black

The
K-band observations were performed with GRAVITY+ on the VLTI using all 4 UTs,
detecting a differential phase signal that traces the spatially resolved
kinematics for both the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines in the broad line region.
We fit the two lines simultaneously with an updated model that includes
distinct rotating and conical outflowing components. We find that more than
80\% of the HI line emission from the BLR originates in an outflow with a
velocity up to $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is oriented so that our line of sight
is along an edge of the conical structure, which produces the prominent blue
wing on the line profile. A combination of anisotropic line emission and
mid-plane opacity lead to the single-sided phase signal. The model is able to
qualitatively match both the outflowing CIV line profile and the systemic OI
fluorescent emission. The derived black hole mass of $8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ is
the highest redshift black hole mass measurement to date obtained directly from
BLR dynamics. It is an order of magnitude lower than that inferred from various
single epoch scaling relations, and implies that the accretion is highly
super-Eddington. With reference to recent simulations, the data suggest that
this QSO is emitting close to its radiative limit in a regime where strong
outflows are expected around a polar conical region.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14019v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS): TBD. Unveiling

with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become
challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies.
We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions
within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us
to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of
the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an
unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on
spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which
is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied
this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances <100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the
Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all
observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared
Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their
median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these
measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR
diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among
others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions,
and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission
coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other
composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This
is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are
indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method
serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an
in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13580v1" target="_blank"><h2>Aeos is Mixing it Up: The (In)homogeneity of Metal Mixing Following

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> high redshift (abstract), feedback (abstract), stellar feedback (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar surface abundances are records of the state of the gas from which
stars formed, and thus trace how individual elements have mixed into the
surrounding medium following their ejection from stars. In this work, we test
the common assumption of instantaneous and homogeneous metal mixing during the
formation of the first Population II stars by characterizing the chemical
homogeneity of the gas in simulated star-forming environments enriched by
Population III stellar feedback. Testing the homogeneity of metal mixing in
this time period is necessary for understanding the spread of abundances in the
most metal-poor stars, and the (in)homogeneity of individual sites of star
formation. Using Aeos, a suite of star-by-star cosmological simulations, we
quantify how gas abundances change over space and time relative to Population
II stellar abundances using Mahalanobis distances, a measure of
covariance-normalized dissimilarity. We find that the homogeneous mixing
assumption holds only within $\sim100$ pc of a star-forming region and $\sim 7$
Myr following the star formation event. Beyond this regime, deviations between
stellar and gas abundances increase until they become indistinguishable from
assuming a homogeneous mix of metals averaged over the initial mass function.
This highlights the limited applicability of assuming instantaneous and
homogeneous mixing in realistic halo environments at high redshift. We identify
critical mixing scales that are necessary to explore chemical evolution in the
early Universe. These scales can be applied to determine the precision needed
for accurate chemical tagging of observed data and to explore parameter space
with analytical models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13411v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Broadband View of the Bare Seyfert PG 1426+015: Relativistic

observation of the type 1 Seyfert PG 1426+015, a source of particular interest
as the most massive reverberation-mapped black hole to date ($\log
[M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\odot}]$ = $9.01^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$). The high-resolution RGS
data confirm the 'bare' nature of the source, showing no evidence for
absorption beyond the Galactic column, while the broadband spectrum
unambiguously reveals the presence of relativistic reflection from the
innermost accretion disc (in the form of a relativistically broadened iron
emission and associated Compton reflection hump) as well as confirming the
presence of the strong soft excess reported previously. We explore whether
relativistic reflection can successfully account for the soft excess along with
the higher-energy reflection features, utilizing the two most-commonly used
reflection codes (REFLIONX, XILLVER). Ultimately we find that both models are
able to successfully reproduce the soft excess, though in the case of the
XILLVER model this is contingent on reducing the strength of the O VIII line
included in the model, as otherwise this feature prevents the model from
reproducing the data. The reflection models that successfully reproduce the
broadband data imply a relatively high density for the accretion disc of $\log
[n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}] \sim 18$, consistent with the loose
anti-correlation seen from other AGN in the $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}]$
vs $\log[m_{\rm{BH}} \dot{m}^2]$ plane, as well as a moderate-to-high black
hole spin of $a^* \gtrsim 0.7$. This preliminary spin constraint is strongly
dependent on the assumption that the soft excess is dominated by relativistic
reflection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13983v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scientific Objectives of the Xue-shan-mu-chang 15-meter Submillimeter

until now those that achieve the high completeness and precision necessary to

a redshift completeness of $90\%$ for galaxies with $Y<21.2$ mag. We showcase
the science potential by exploring the impact of environment on the fraction

exhibit increased AGN fractions but decreased AGN luminosities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13845v1" target="_blank"><h2>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons destruction in star-forming regions

medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in
ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the
abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM
physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS
survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a
gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and
~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH
fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM
areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) > 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H
II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter,
suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or
hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction
declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting
less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating
dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we
see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH
fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our
results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction
within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global
abundance in galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12966v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of low surface brightness ultra-thin galaxies: The role of

their evolution. We follow the evolution of ultrathin stellar disks with
varying dark matter (DM) halo concentration ($c$) using collisionless $N$-body
simulations with \texttt{AREPO}. We test models embedded in steep ($c = 12$),
shallow ($c = 2$), and intermediate ($c = 6$) DM concentrations. Our models
match the observed structural properties of the stellar disk in the low surface
brightness (LSB) ultrathin galaxy FGC~2366, specifically its surface
brightness, disk scalelength, and vertical thinness ($h_{z}/R_{D} = 0.1$),
while excluding gas, allowing us to isolate the effects of DM. The internal
disk heating mechanism driven by bars is suppressed in the LSB ultrathin
stellar disks regardless of the DM concentration. The ratio of disk thickness
($h_z$) to scalelength ($R_D$) remains constant at $\leq 0.1$ throughout their
evolution. To clearly establish that the LSB nature of stellar disks is the key
to preventing disk thickening, we construct the initial conditions by
increasing the stellar mass fraction from $f_{s} \sim 0.01$ to $0.02$ and
$0.04$, respectively, while keeping the total mass equal to $10^{11} M_\odot$
and $h_z/R_D \leq 0.1$ unchanged. We find that models with a higher stellar
mass fraction embedded in a shallow DM potential ($c = 2$) form bars and
undergo significant disk thickening ($h_{z}/R_{D} \gg 0.1$) concurrent with the
bar growth. We conclude that if the LSB disks are thin to begin with, they
remain so throughout their evolution in isolation, regardless of the
concentration of the DM halo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13622v1" target="_blank"><h2>A statistical look on kinematic planes of satellite galaxies I:

galaxy sets, with fixed-in-time identities, forming kinematically-persistent
planes (KPPs) along cosmic time around 190 MW/M31-like galaxies. This is the
first study to assess their frequency within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We
identify KPPs around 46 of these host galaxies, with at least 25\% of their
satellites in such configurations. Thereby, KPPs appear more frequent than
previously reported, appearing in $\sim24\%$ of MW/M31-like systems, and in
$\sim40\%$ of those populated with $N_{\rm sat}\geq9$. We find a dependency of
the former frequency on the minimum satellite stellar mass cut, suggesting that
it would increase with higher mass resolution. KPP satellite members form a
distinct set compared to satellites outside KPPs, located at further distances
from the center of their host and maintaining higher specific angular momentum
since high redshift. KPP satellites form thin and oblate planes in positional
space during long periods of cosmic time. We statistically confirm that KPPs
form a kind of backbone of observationally-detected positional planes, and
that, in velocity space, KPPs behave as kinematic morphological disks. We show
that KPP formation, defined as the time when satellite orbital poles align
around a specific, fixed direction (occurring at Universe age $\sim4$ Gyr),
predates the end of halo's fast-phase of mass assembly, indicating that halo
processes do not drive this clustering. Finally, our results are broadly
consistent with the MW's kinematic plane at $z=0$ concerning its morphological
properties and degree of satellite orbital poles clustering, mitigating the
tension between the existence of these structures and the $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12624v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting thermodynamics at the outskirts of the Perseus cluster with

outskirts of galaxy clusters provide valuable insights into the growth of the
dark matter halo and the heating of the ICM. Considering the results of the
soft X-ray background study of non-cluster Suzaku fields, we revisit 65 Suzaku
pointing observations of the Perseus cluster in eight azimuthal directions
beyond 1 Mpc (0.8 $r_{500}$). A possible foreground component, whose spectrum
is modeled as a 1 keV collisional ionization equilibrium plasma, significantly
affects the temperature and density measurements of the ICM in cluster
outskirts. The emission measures in the six arms are similar, showing that the
radial slopes of temperature and density follow $r^{-0.67\pm0.25}$ and
$r^{-2.21\pm 0.06}$, respectively. The radial pressure profile is close to the
average profile measured by the Planck satellite. The resulting entropy slope
is $\propto r^{0.81\pm 0.25}$, consistent with the theoretical slope of 1.1.
The integrated gas fraction, the ratio of the integrated gas mass to the
hydrostatic mass, is estimated to be 0.13$\pm$0.01 and 0.18$\pm$0.02 at
$r_{500}$ and $r_{200}$, respectively, consistent with the cosmic baryon
fraction. These results suggest that the ICM at the cluster outskirts is quite
regular and close to hydrostatic equilibrium. The remaining two arms show that
the emission measure is higher by a factor of 1.5-2, possibly due to accretion
from filaments from the large-scale structure. A sudden drop in the emission

(ALPs) into photons in compact-star environments, focusing on the hot,
transient conditions of core-collapse supernova (SN) remnants and neutron-star
mergers (NSMs). We address previously overlooked uncertainties, particularly
the suppression caused by ejected matter near the stellar surface, a region
crucial to the conversion process. We derive analytical expressions for the
transition rate; they reveal the influence of key parameters and their
uncertainties. We update constraints using historical gamma-ray data from
SN~1987A and find $g_{a\gamma}<5\times10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for
$m_a\lesssim10^{-9}$ meV. We also forecast sensitivities for a future Galactic
SN and for NSMs, assuming observations with Fermi-LAT or similar gamma-ray
instruments. We distinguish ALPs -- defined as coupling only to photons and
produced via Primakoff scattering -- from axions, which also couple to nucleons
and emerge through nuclear bremsstrahlung. We omit pionic axion production due
to its large uncertainties and inconsistencies, though it could contribute
comparably to bremsstrahlung under optimistic assumptions. For the compact
sources, we adopt time-averaged one-zone models, guided by numerical
simulations, to enable clear and reproducible parametric studies.</p></br></body>
