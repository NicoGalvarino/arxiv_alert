Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed
quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| > 10^\circ$.
This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities.
AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using
data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky
survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter
than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection
criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types,
which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron
low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic
observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter
telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter
telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at
Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband
photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during
the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted
cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of
$44.9<\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)<48.0$ at redshifts
between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable
resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their
environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05739v1" target="_blank"><h2>A long time ago in an LAE far, far away: a signpost of early

13$, the highest redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) ever observed. This
observation suggests that either the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding
JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is highly ionized, or the galaxy's intrinsic Ly$\alpha$
emission properties are extreme. We use radiative transfer simulations of
reionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM
to investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find
that if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with
properties characteristic of LAEs at $z \sim 6$, its detection suggests that
the universe is $\gtrsim 5\%$ ionized by $z = 13$. We also investigate the
possibility that the extreme properties of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA are driven by an
AGN. Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce
more ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that
JADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\%$, $66\%$, and $33\%$ if the IGM is $<
1\%$, $\approx 5\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ ionized, respectively. We also highlight
other features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA that may be indicative of
AGN activity, including strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption extending to
$\sim 1300$ angstroms, and a possible CII*$\lambda1335$ emission line. Our
findings strongly motivate dedicated follow-up observations of
JADES-GS-z13-1-LA to determine whether it hosts an AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05740v1" target="_blank"><h2>Strength in Numbers: Red Galaxies Bolster the Cosmic Star Formation Rate

accurate census of dust-enshrouded star formation over cosmic time. We provide
strong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based
on their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777
galaxies spans $1 < z < 8$ and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST
COSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that
these dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median $\mathrm{SFR \sim
40M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) =
10.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full
JWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that
red galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 \% of galaxies with
$\log(M/M_{\odot}) > 10$ at $z = 3.3$, rising to 91\% by $z \sim 7$ (albeit
with large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the
number density of massive red star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6$ is sufficient
to explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$, consistent with
typical quenching timescales allowed in the $\mathrm{\sim 1Gyr}$ interval from
$z \sim 6$ to $z \sim 3$. This large abundance yields a substantial
contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at $z \sim 4$, red
galaxies provide $\mathrm {\rho_{SFR} = 3.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-2}
M_{\odot} yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}}$, and at $z \sim 5$ they supply nearly 40 \% of the
total $\rho_{SFR}$. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected
dusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude. Future deeper
and wider ALMA surveys will provide further opportunities to strengthen and
extend our results in our quest to fully quantify the contribution of
dust-obscured activity to $\rho_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ at high redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05781v1" target="_blank"><h2>Data-driven dust inference at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using

Mandel, Gerry Gilmore</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (title, abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a method for accurately and precisely inferring photometric dust
extinction towards stars at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using probabilistic
machine learning to model the colour-magnitude distribution of zero-extinction
stars in these regions. Photometric dust maps rely on a robust method for
inferring stellar reddening. At high Galactic latitudes, where extinction is
low, such inferences are particularly susceptible to contamination from
modelling errors and prior assumptions, potentially introducing artificial
structure into dust maps. In this work, we demonstrate the use of normalising
flows to learn the conditional probability distribution of the photometric
colour-magnitude relations of zero-extinction stars, conditioned on Galactic
cylindrical coordinates for stars within 2.5 kpc at mid-to-high Galactic
latitudes. By using the normalising flow to model the colour-magnitude diagram,
we infer the posterior distribution of dust extinction towards stars along
different lines of sight by marginalising over the flow. We validate our method
using data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS, showing that we recover unbiased
posteriors and successfully detect dust along the line of sight in two
calibration regions at mid-Galactic latitude that have been extensively studied
in the context of polarisation surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06232v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Targeted Gamma-Ray Search of Five Prominent Galaxy Merger Systems with

intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which
can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We
present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy
merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114
using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a
binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law
spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain
$\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for
NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16,
$\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$
and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively,
suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission.
The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $< 5$). This is the first
targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger
systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06075v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio continuum and \HI 21-cm line observations of a nearby luminous

and spectral line emission in IRAS 17526+3253, along with an analysis of its
arcsecond-scale radio properties using archival VLA data. The EVN observations
detected radio continuum emission from both the northwest (NW) and southeast
(SE) nuclei. The NW nucleus shows two components with high brightness
temperatures and radio luminosities, likely indicating the presence of an AGN
core and jet. Meanwhile, our EVN observation failed to detect the OH line
emission, possibly due to radio frequency interference and/or the emission
being partly resolved out and below our detection limit. The multi-band radio
spectral energy distribution (SED) deviates from a single power-law at low
frequencies, suggesting low-frequency absorption. The GMRT spectral line data
reveal both \HI absorption and emission. The \HI emission is diffuse and shows
a velocity gradient from about 7500 \kms in the NW to 7800 \kms in the SE
nucleus. On larger scales, the \HI emission extends about 4' along the NW-SE
direction, with the southeastern extension matching the optical tidal tail. In
addition, the weak \HI absorption features show broad line profiles, possibly
due to overlapping \HI gas from the two nuclei. The aforementioned results are
consistent with properties of intermediate-stage mergers reported in the
literature.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05918v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of magnetized hub-filament systems: Comparing the observed

W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106 - spanning evolutionary stages from early to
advanced, with a focus on their magnetic field (B-field) structures and
filament line-mass distributions. Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS
evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our
analysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar
populations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized
emission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival
infrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We
derive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct
filament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization
intensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation
between B-fields and filaments.
  As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF),
PF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also
increases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the
plane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent
with known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity
between hub sizes and young cluster radii. "Double-node" star formation - where
two subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a
common HFS feature. We present evidence for its widespread occurrence across
several well-studied, nearby star-forming clouds.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05752v1" target="_blank"><h2>Excavating The Ruins: an Ancient $z=2.675$ Galaxy Which Formed in the

``Eridu.'' Simultaneously modeling the JWST/NIRSpec G140M and G235M spectra
from the SMILES program and $0.4-25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ HST, JWST/NIRCam, and
JWST/MIRI photometry from the the JADES+SMILES photometric catalogs shows that
Eridu is massive and quiescent with stellar mass
$\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})=10.96^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and average star formation
rate $<1\ \mathrm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$ over the last 100 Myr. Star formation
histories inferred from various models produce disconcertingly early and fast
formation within $\sim300$ Myr of the Big Bang and quenching 2 Gyr prior to
observation ($z\sim10$). This stellar mass assembly implies that the progenitor
of Eridu had $M_*\approx10^{11}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z>10$, nearly two orders
of magnitude more than the most massive current high redshift observations.
From Eridu's spectrum we infer $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} =+0.65^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$,
indicating its stellar population is extremely $\alpha$-enhanced, which is
consistent with the rapid formation timescale inferred from its star formation
history. Eridu inhabits a massive protostructure which offers additional
explanations for rapid mass assembly and quenching via environmental
mechanisms, e.g. major mergers. Though its inferred formation is at odds with
observations of the brightest cosmic dawn galaxies, we anticipate that future
high-redshift galaxy formation models and sophisticated stellar population
modeling codes will unearth how Eridu formed at the dawn of time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05746v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can dynamic dark energy explain the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low'

DeRose</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the impact of a DESI motivated dynamic dark energy cosmology
on three cosmological anomalies, the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low'
effect, and observations of strong baryonic feedback. We analyze how these
observations vary in $\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the
galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy
clustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are
primarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the
lensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy
increases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is
insufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus,
we find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three
cosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on
cosmic expansion at $z\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic
oscillations are limited by the small volume. Because lensing is sensitive to
distances, in addition to growth, we argue that lensing measurements are a
promising alternative to constrain expansion deviations from $\Lambda$ at low
redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05742v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Consequences of Rubin Observatory Time-Domain Survey Design and

and dominate the low-frequency gravitational wave background. Finding binary
SMBHs in existing time-domain observations has proven difficult, as their
periodic, electromagnetic signals can be confused with the natural variability
of single quasars. In this work, we investigate the effects of host-galaxy
contamination and survey design (cadence and duration) on the detectability of
binary SMBHs with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST). We simulate millions of LSST light curves of single and binary
quasars, with a distribution of quasar and host-galaxy properties motivated by
empirical observations and the anticipated LSST detection space. We then apply
simple sinusoidal curve fits as a potential, computationally inexpensive
detection method. We find that host-galaxy contamination will increase
false-positive rates and decrease binary parameter recovery rates. Lower mass,
lower luminosity binary systems are most likely to be negatively affected by
host galaxy contamination. We also find that monitoring duration affects binary
detection more than survey effective cadence for this detection method. As the
light curve duration increases, false-positive rates are suppressed and binary
parameter recovery rates, especially for binary period, are improved.
Increasing the light curve duration from 5 to 10 yrs shows the most dramatic
improvement for successful binary detection and false-positive rejection, with
additional improvement from extending the light curve duration to 20 yrs. The
observation duration increase is especially critical for recovering binary
periods that are longer than a decade.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05733v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the origin of the Milky Way streams. A revised look at

Accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar streams around the Milky Way (MW) can provide valuable insights into
its history and substructure formation. Previous studies have suggested that
several MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of
satellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given
that many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In
this work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole
distribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For
a sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d<100$ kpc we find that
the pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we
subtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower
distance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the
streams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction
similar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole
distribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the
orbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole
distribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample,
we infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to
be affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical
simulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common
origin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated
until the selected sample also includes material at $d \gtrsim 150$ kpc.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05450v1" target="_blank"><h2>First detection of circular polarization in 4.7 GHz excited OH masers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Derck P Smits, Paul Fallon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report the first detection of circular polarization in 4.7 GHz excited OH
