  feedback and comparison with [O III] emission outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mayank Sharma, Nahum Arav, Maryam Dehghanian, Gwen Walker, Kyle Johnston, Matthew Kaupin, Justin Gandhi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for Publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Quasar outflows can play a crucial role in the evolution of their host
galaxies through various feedback processes. This effect is expected to be
particularly important when the universe was only 2-3 billion years old, during
the period known as cosmic noon. By utilizing observations from the Dark Energy
Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI), we conduct a survey of high-ionization quasar
outflows at cosmic noon, with the aim of doubling the current sample of such
outflows with distance and energetics determination. We also aim to compare
these properties to those derived from spatially resolved outflows in similar
quasars probed through Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS). In a sample of 130
quasars we detect signatures of high-ionization outflows in the form of a S IV
trough in eight objects. We characterize the physical conditions of these
outflows by determining their total hydrogen column density ($N_H$), ionization
parameter ($U_H$), and electron number density ($n_e$). The detected outflows
show complex kinematic structures with a wide range in blueshifted velocities
(100$-$4600 km s$^{-1}$). We locate five out of the eight outflows at distances
between 240$-$5500 pc away from the central source. From the combined sample of
15 high-ionization S IV outflows at cosmic noon, we find a high fraction (up to
46 %) of them to be powerful enough to contribute significantly to multi-stage
AGN feedback processes. Their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities are
also found to be consistent with spatially resolved outflows in a luminosity
and redshift matched sample of quasars. Comparison with previous spectra
reveals interesting variations in some objects, with two cases of emerging
high-velocity broad absorption line features with velocities of $-$8000 and
$-$39,000 km s$^{-1}$. An impressive case of four line-locked Si IV outflow
systems is also revealed in one of the objects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11664v1" target="_blank"><h2>From FFB Starbursts at Cosmic Dawn to Quenching at Cosmic Morning: Hi-z
  Galaxy Bimodality</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Avishai Dekel, Nir Mandelker, Zhaozhou Li, Zhiyuan Yao, Bocheng Zhu, Sharon Lapiner, Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury, Omri Ginzburg</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 13 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a mass-dependent bimodality in the early evolution of galaxies.
The massive track connects the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z>8$) to
the super-massive quiescent galaxies and black holes (BHs) at cosmic morning
($z=4-7$). The dark-matter halos $>10^{10.5}M_\odot$ at $z=10$ are expected to
undergo feedback-free starbursts (FFB) with high star-formation efficiency in
dense star clusters within compact galaxies. The less massive halos avoid FFB
and form stars gradually under stellar feedback, leading to the peak
star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon ($z=1-3$). The FFB and non-FFB halos
originate from $>4\sigma$ and $2-3\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The
post-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and
remain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows,
(b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams
within the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium
(CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key
for complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and
growth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence
or photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge. The cosmic-morning
quiescent galaxies are expected to be massive, compact, showing signatures of
compaction, outflows and AGN, with a comoving number density $\sim 10^{-5} {\rm
Mpc}^{-3}$, comparable to the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn and the AGN
at cosmic morning. Their UV luminosity function should peak about $M_{\rm uv}
\sim -22$ and contribute $\sim 10\%$ of the galaxies there.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11935v1" target="_blank"><h2>MIGHTEE-HI: The direct detection of neutral hydrogen in galaxies at

star formation in galaxies emerges. However, the weakness of the line means it
has been difficult to directly detect in all but the very local Universe. Here
we present results from the first search using the MeerKAT International Tiered
Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey for high-redshift ($z>0.25$) H{\sc
i} emission from individual galaxies. By searching for 21-cm emission centered
on the position and redshift of optically-selected emission-line galaxies we
overcome difficulties that hinder untargeted searches. We detect 11 galaxies at
$z>0.25$, forming the first sample of $z>0.25$ detections with an
interferometer, with the highest redshift detection at $z = 0.3841$. We find
they have much larger H{\sc i} masses than their low-redshift H{\sc i}-selected
counterparts for a given stellar mass. This can be explained by the much larger
cosmological volume probed at these high redshifts, and does not require any
evolution of the H{\sc i} mass function. We make the first-ever measurement of
the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFr) with H{\sc i} at $z>0.25$ and find
consistency with the local bTFr, but with tentative evidence of a flattening in
the relation at these redshifts for higher-mass objects. This may signify
evolution, in line with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, or that the
molecular gas mass in these high-mass galaxies could be significant. This study
paves the way for future studies of H{\sc i} beyond the local Universe, using
both searches targeted at known objects and via pure H{\sc i} selection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11685v1" target="_blank"><h2>HeII emitters in the cosmic noon and beyond. Characterising the HeII

Iglesias-Páramo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables. Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early
stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon',
when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin
of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a
systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from
the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec
data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive
gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron
densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising
photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar
mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar
multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission.
Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H)
> 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100
Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can
reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities,
models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300
Msol) and Zstar much lower < Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully
account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce
that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the
ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12141v1" target="_blank"><h2>A big red dot at cosmic noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Federica Loiacono, Roberto Gilli, Marco Mignoli, Giovanni Mazzolari, Roberto Decarli, Marcella Brusa, Francesco Calura, Marco Chiaberge, Andrea Comastri, Quirino D'Amato, Kazushi Iwasawa, Ignas Juodžbalis, Giorgio Lanzuisi, Roberto Maiolino, Stefano Marchesi, Colin Norman, Alessandro Peca, Isabella Prandoni, Matteo Sapori, Matilde Signorini, Paolo Tozzi, Eros Vanzella, Cristian Vignali, Fabio Vito, Gianni Zamorani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 7 figures, submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red
dot'), at $z=2.33$ in the field around the $z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using
NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color
vs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS
spectrum reveals the emission from HeI$\lambda 10830$ and PaG line, both
showing a narrow and a broad ($FWHM\gtrsim 2000\ \rm kms^{-1}$) component. The
HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI
column density in the $2^3S$ level $N\sim 0.5-1.2\times 10^{14}\rm cm^{-2}$,
depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of
$\Delta v \sim -830\ \rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD
does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric
luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M_{\rm
BH}\sim 10^8\rm M_{\odot}$ and $L_{\rm bol}\sim 2.9\times 10^{45}\rm
ergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with
other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta
Stone") at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI
absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be
common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at
$z<3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L_{\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space
density is only a factor of $\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV-selected quasars
with comparable $L_{\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to
the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is
also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs
probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may
suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to
cosmic noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12122v1" target="_blank"><h2>pop-cosmos: Insights from generative modeling of a deep,

Software available atthis https URL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy
population up to redshift $z\sim6$. The model is trained on distributions of
observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of $\sim420,000$
galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC $\textit{Ch. 1}<26$. The
generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population
synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty
model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained
model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the
stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar
metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement
with previously published results. We explore the connection between
mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation

sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a
prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters
for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available
spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias
($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter
($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full

Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The gas-phase metallicity gradients of galaxies have been extensively studied
over the past four decades both in the local and high-redshift universe, as
they trace the baryon cycle and growth of galaxies. With the unprecedented
spatial resolution and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it
is now possible to measure metallicity and its radial gradients out to
redshifts as high as $z = 9$. Here, we present a sample of 456
spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from redshifts $1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$
that are spatially resolved on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales by deep JWST NIRCam
or NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS). Synthesizing these new JWST
observations with legacy observations from the literature, we observe that at
redshift $z > 5$, galaxy centers are more metal-rich, exhibiting negative
metallicity gradients of $\sim-0.4$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. These gradients flatten
over time, reaching near-zero around $z \approx 2$, coinciding with the peak of
the cosmic star formation rate. Beyond this point, the gradients become
negative again at lower redshifts approaching $z=0$. This evolution likely
reflects transitions in galaxy formation modes: an inside-out growth phase
dominated by intense central star formation with inefficient feedback and
limited gas mixing during ``cosmic dawn", enhanced gas mixing due to
feedback-driven wind and gas accretion at ``cosmic noon", and a later phase of
slow evolution and reduced feedback toward the present day. These physical
processes including gas accretion and feedback not only regulate star and
galaxy formation on cosmic scale, but also shape the evolutionary pathways of
individual galaxies over cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12124v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST IFU observations uncover host galaxy continua in extremely red and

because of the high contrast between the quasar and its host and redshifted
light, making them primarily visible in the infrared. We present JWST NIRSpec
integral field unit (IFU) observations of six extremely red quasars (ERQs) at
$z=2.4-2.9$ and two dust-obscured quasars at lower redshifts. Using image
decomposition across the spectral range, we successfully separate quasar and
host galaxy continuum emission, model host morphologies, and extract spectra.
The ERQs and obscured quasars have compact host galaxies with half-light radii
of 1.4$-$2.9 kpc and stellar masses of 10$^{10.6-10.9}$ $M_{\odot}$. Their
stellar masses are consistent with the average stellar mass of quasar hosts as
expected from abundance matching and clustering analysis. Most of the quasars
in our sample exhibit significant spatial offsets (0.4$-$1.3 kpc) between the
quasar and host galaxy, potentially caused by post-merger dynamics or
non-uniform dust obscuration. The ERQs reside 0.5$-$2 dex above the local black
hole-stellar mass relation, similar to other heavily obscured populations such
as HotDOGs, optically selected quasars at cosmic noon, and high-redshift SMBH
candidates identified with JWST. However, this "over-massive" feature might be
attributed to selection bias. Compared to HST-based studies, our JWST
measurements reveal more compact host galaxies, smaller Sersic indices, and
lower stellar masses, likely because of improved resolution, more accurate
modeling, and minimal line contamination. These findings highlight the unique
capabilities of JWST IFU in revealing quasar host galaxy properties and
potential evolutionary stages of obscured quasars at cosmic noon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12130v1" target="_blank"><h2>Biases in stellar masses of JWST high-z quasar host galaxies caused by

evolution with more than 30 high-z quasar host galaxy detections. Many of these
observations imply galaxies with black holes that are overmassive compared to
their low-z counterparts. However, the bright quasar point source removal may
cause significant biases in these stellar mass measurements. We develop a
simulation-based inference method to disentangle the quasar host galaxy stellar
mass measurements from observational biases during the point source removal. We
use the BlueTides simulation to generate mock images and perform point source
removal on thousands of simulated high-z quasar host galaxies, constructing
corrected host magnitude posteriors. We find that JWST photometry tends to
either correctly recover or modestly misestimate host magnitudes, with a
maximum magnitude underestimate of 0.21 mag. With our corrected magnitude
posteriors, we perform SED fitting on each quasar host galaxy and compare the
stellar mass measurement before and after the correction. We find that stellar
mass estimates are generally robust, or overestimated by $\leq0.3$ dex. We also
find that the stellar masses of a subset of hosts (J1120+0641, J0844-0132,
J0911+0152, and J1146-0005) remain unconstrained, as key photometric bands
provide only flux upper limits. Understanding these biases is essential to
uncovering the evolutionary pathways of high-z quasars with their hosts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11846v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Ultra-Faint, Chemically Primitive Galaxy Forming at the Epoch of

spectroscopic observations of LAP1-B, an ultra-faint galaxy at redshift
z_{spec}=6.625 +/-0.001, corresponding to a cosmic age of 800 million years
after the Big Bang, strongly magnified by gravitational lensing. LAP1-B
exhibits a gas-phase oxygen abundance of (4.2 +/- 1.8) x 10^{-3} times the
solar value, making it the most chemically primitive galaxy ever identified at
any epoch to date. The galaxy displays an exceptionally hard ionizing radiation
field, which is inconsistent with chemically enriched stellar populations or
accreting black holes, but consistent with theoretical predictions for
zero-metallicity stars. It also shows an elevated carbon-to-oxygen abundance
ratio for its metallicity in the interstellar medium, matching nucleosynthetic
yields expected from stellar population formed in the absence of initial
metals. The lack of detectable stellar continuum constrains the stellar mass to
<2700 Msun, while the dynamical mass, derived from emission-line kinematics,
exceeds the combined stellar and gas mass by more than two orders of magnitude,
indicating the presence of a dominant dark matter halo. These observations
establish LAP1-B as the most chemically primitive star-forming galaxy yet
identified, offering a rare window into the earliest stages of galaxy
formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13254v1" target="_blank"><h2>A new classification of ex-situ and in-situ Galactic globular clusters

Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and
orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC)
populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution
of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical
friction and mass loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to track
the trajectory of about 18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies
from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and
ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to
confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like
galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E < 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm
hm}^{*})$ where $E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular
orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results
challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in
the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the
two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ
GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ
clusters at $E > 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$, and that the real challenge
lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this
context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs
observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature.
Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin,
they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within
MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and
$L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time
and by dynamical friction, respectively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13005v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling of the High Column Density systems in The Lyman-Alpha Forest</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  T.

be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological
information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations.
While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the
intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics
of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with
column densities log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 17 to damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs)
with log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 20.2. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption
characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the
power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a
scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a
model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column
densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias
of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically
well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable
to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss
the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and
their bias is uncertain.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13716v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mass models of galaxy clusters from a non-parametric weak-lensing

for weak gravitational lensing observations. This method is non-parametric,
allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities,
without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes
spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to
significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass
profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and
baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are
consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation
curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions,
finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend
strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass
profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH
clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (3) The
non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation
expected in $\Lambda$CDM; fitting parametric NFW halos to the non-parametric
mass profiles gives results in overall agreement with the expected
mass-concentration relation, though the concentrations are relatively poorly
constrained. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic
Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined
by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass

Submitted to the ApJL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The measurements of the number density of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses can be
used to put statistical constraints on the foreground mass distributions. Dusty
galaxies uncovered in submillimeter surveys are particularly useful in this
regard because of the large volume probed by these surveys. Previous
discoveries of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed dusty galaxies are predominantly the
brightest in the sky discovered by Herschel, SPT, and Planck. However, models
have also predicted a non-negligible fraction of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed
faint dusty galaxies, which were difficult to confirm due to technical
difficulties. Utilizing the deepest SCUBA-2 submillimeter survey, STUDIES, in
both the COSMOS and the UDS fields, together with a red JWST color selection
method, we discover a population of 13 strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty
galaxies. The rich ancillary data allow us to confirm their strongly lensed
nature via estimates of redshifts and lens modeling. Our systematic search has
allowed us to construct the 450$\mu$m number counts of strongly lensed sources
down to the flux levels about an order of magnitude fainter than previous
measurements. The measured lensing fractions of $\sim$1% are consistent with
predictions from models that also successfully produce the number density of
the strong galaxy-galaxy lensed bright dusty galaxies. Future searches from
Euclid and Roman are expected to discover orders of magnitude more strongly
lensed faint dusty galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12827v1" target="_blank"><h2>21 cm Signal from the Thermal Evolution of Lyman-$α$ during Cosmic
  Dawn</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Janakee Raste, Shiv K. Sethi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Lyman-$\alpha$ photons couple the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen
(HI) to the kinetic temperature during the era of cosmic dawn. During this
process, they also exchange energy with the medium, heating and cooling the HI.
In addition, we expect X-ray photons to heat the mostly neutral gas during this
era. We solve this coupled system (Lyman-$\alpha$-HI system along with X-ray
heating) for a period of 500 Myr (redshift range $8 <z < 25$). Our main results
are: (a) without X-ray heating, the temperature of the gas reaches an
equilibrium which is nearly independent of photon intensity and only weakly
dependent on the expansion of the universe. The main determinant of the
quasi-static temperature is the ratio of injected and continuum Lyman-$\alpha$
photons, (b) while X-ray photons provide an additional source of heating at
initial times, for large enough Lyman-$\alpha$ photon intensity, the system
tends to reach the same quasi-static temperature as expected without additional
heating. This limit is reached when the density of photons close to the
Lyman-$\alpha$ resonance far exceeds the HI number density, (c) we compute the
global HI signal for these scenarios. In the limit of the large density of
Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, the spin temperature of the hyperfine line is fixed.
This freezes the global HI signal from the era of cosmic dawn and the
cross-over redshift from absorption to emission. This feature depends only on
the ratio of injected to continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, and the global HI
signal can help us determine this ratio.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11553v1" target="_blank"><h2>Circum-nuclear eccentric gas flow in the Galactic Center revealed by

the kinematic structure of the innermost $\sim 10$ pc region of the Galaxy,
which contains the high-velocity compact cloud (HVCC) at $(l,b,v_{\rm

a noncircular (eccentric) motion of the molecular gas in the gravitational

We argue that G0.02 is a kinematic tracer of the inner potential, a rare case

Radio frequency molecular absorption lines appear along sight lines

2.6mm CO emission is absent. Aims. We discuss absorption lines of HCO+, C2H,
HCN, CS, and HCO in a larger sample (88 sight lines) than was available before.
Methods. We observed millimeter-wave absorption at the IRAM and ALMA
interferometers over the past 30 years and gathered the results for to compare
with observations of HCO+ and CO emission taken at the ARO KP12m and IRAM 30m
telescopes. Results: We detected HCO+ along 72 of 86 sightlines where it was
observed, C2H along 53 of 76 sightlines and HCN along 38 of 57 sightlines. C2H
is ubiquitous and N(C2H)/N(HCO+) increases at smaller EB-V and smaller N(HCO+)
but C2H absorption is intrinsically weaker, decreasing the number of sightlines
with low column density along which it was detected.The dense-gas tracer HCN

using a mass-complete sample of $\sim$14,000 galaxies from the CANDELS survey,
selected with $H_{\rm mag} \leq 24$, $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^9\,{\rm
M}_\odot$, and spanning $0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4$. Adopting an unbiased
morphological classification, free from visual inspection or parametric
assumptions, we explore the evolution of specific star formation rate (sSFR),
stellar mass, structural properties, and galaxy fractions as a function of
redshift and morphology. We find that while disk and bulge-dominated galaxies
exhibit similar sSFR distributions at $z \sim 2.4$, bulge-dominated systems
develop a redshift-dependent bimodality below $z < 1.6$, unlike the unimodal
behaviour of disks. This bimodality correlates with stellar mass:
bulge-dominated galaxies with lower sSFR are significantly more massive and
exhibit higher S\'ersic indices than their star-forming counterparts, despite
having similar effective radii. Based on a Gaussian mixture decomposition, we
identify two evolutionary tracks for bulge-dominated galaxies: G1, a
long-lived, star-forming population with disk-like properties; and G2, a
quenched, massive population whose prominence increases with decreasing
redshift. The evolution of the star formation main sequence and
morphology--mass fractions support a scenario in which G2 systems form through
merger-driven transformations of massive disks. Our results indicate that
bulge-dominated galaxies are not a homogeneous population, but instead follow
divergent evolutionary paths driven by distinct physical mechanisms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12923v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating nearby disc galaxies on the main star formation sequence II.

suggested a structural change in the distribution of the interstellar medium
(ISM) around a stellar mass M$_{*}$ of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. In the
higher-mass regime (M$_{*} \geq 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), we observe the formation
of a central gas and stellar disc with a typical size of a few hundred parsecs
connected through lanes to the ends of the stellar bar. In the lower-mass
regime (M$_{*} < 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), such an inner disc is absent and the
gas component exhibits a more chaotic distribution. Observations of nearby
star-forming galaxies support the existence of such a change. These inner gas
discs may represent an important intermediate scale connecting the large
kiloparsec-scale structures with the nuclear (sub-parsec) region, transporting
gas inwards to fuel the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). For this work,
we used an extended set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of
isolated disc galaxies with initial properties (i.e. stellar mass, gas
fraction, stellar disc scale length, and the bulge mass fraction) with
properties covering the range of galaxies in the PHANGS sample to investigate
this change of regime. We studied the physical properties of the star-forming
ISM in both stellar mass regimes and extracted a few physical tracers: the
inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), the probability distribution function (PDF),
the virial parameter, and the Mach number. In line with observations, we
confirm a structure transition in the simulations that occurs between a stellar
mass of $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that the physical origin
of this change of regime is driven by stellar feedback and its contribution
relative to the underlying gravitational potential.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11596v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hydroxylated Mg-rich amorphous silicates as catalysts for molecular

deuterium with Mg-rich amorphous enstatite and forsterite type silicates.
Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the process. During D atom exposure,
deuteroxyl group formation was observed. The cross section for OD group
formation, estimated from the OD stretching band intensity with D atom fluence,
is 4.2.10^{-18} cm^2 for both silicates. HD (D2) molecules form via D atom
abstraction of chemisorbed H(D) atoms from OH (OD) groups, with a cross section
of 7.0.10^{-18} cm^2. Quantum chemical calculations on enstatite and forsterite
amorphous nano-clusters were used to analyze chemisorption and abstraction
energies of H atoms. The formation of OH groups on forsterite is barrierless,
while enstatite has a small energy barrier. H2 abstraction from hydroxyl groups
is barrierless in both silicates. The results support our interpretation of IR
spectral changes during D atom exposure as addition and exchange reactions,
with catalytic molecular deuterium formation. These findings, obtained at 300
K, are relevant to astrophysical environments like photodissociation regions
and interstellar clouds at lower temperatures. Amorphous silicates, like carbon
grains, undergo hydrogenation in the diffuse interstellar medium due to
interactions with atomic hydrogen and UV photons. The detection of these
components on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko connects primitive solar system
objects to interstellar dust, offering new insights into their evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13314v1" target="_blank"><h2>Propagation of Galactic cosmic rays: the influence of anisotropic

Young</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy
clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We
model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law
distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase
jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding
gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to
total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP
fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and
for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles,
the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of
the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with
observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small
non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a
relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty
cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of
the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is
consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose
this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of
real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13560v1" target="_blank"><h2>Insights into the structure and kinematics of a Milky Way-like galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Eva Durán-Camacho, Ana Duarte-Cabral</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> How the large-scale kinematics of the Milky Way (MW) relate -- or even
regulate -- the formation of large-to-small scale structures is incredibly hard
to infer from observations. Here we investigate this interplay through a
detailed analysis of a MW-like galaxy simulation, generated through the
self-consistent evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter. We show that our
model provides a close match to many of the MW's stellar structure and
kinematic features (including in the inner Galaxy, and around the Solar
neighbourhood), and find that the stellar spiral pattern in our model is very
faint, with significantly less multiplicity than the sharper gaseous arms.If
taken as an analogue to the MW, this finding would explain the difficulty in
observational studies to agree on the number and location of our Galaxy's
spiral arms. We also examine radial and tangential velocity residuals in the
disc, and find that sharp kinematic transitions correlate with spiral arms,
especially in the gas, where values reach $30 - 50$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We find
strong radial converging flows promoting spiral-arm growth, while diverging
flows disrupt them. A time-resolved analysis of spiral-ridge segments confirms
that convergence precedes density enhancements and potential star-forming
conditions, while divergence leads to fragmentation and mass redistribution.
These patterns evolve on relatively short timescales ($\sim10-20$\,Myr),
highlighting the transient nature of spiral arms. Our model's spiral arms are
dynamically driven, short-lived features shaped by evolving flows, rather than
static density waves, which could explain the observed lack of contrast of
cloud properties and star formation within and outside spiral arms in the MW.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11943v1" target="_blank"><h2>Calibrating baryonic effects in cosmic shear with external data in the

by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on
small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of
the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects
and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we
generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and
astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon
Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to
which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the
cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of
baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and
determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to
avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that
long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this
threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised
gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge,
however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment
should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11845v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemo-dynamics of the stellar component of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy II:

testing dark matter (DM) models and baryonic feedback implementation in
simulations. The Sculptor 'classical' dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a system with
two distinct stellar populations and high-quality data, offers a remarkable
opportunity to study DM distributions in these galaxies. In this work, we infer
the DM halo density distribution of Sculptor, applying a method based on
spherically symmetric distribution functions depending on actions to fit the
stellar structural and kinematic properties of Sculptor. The galaxy is
represented via four components: two distinct stellar populations based on
distribution functions, tracers within a fixed and dominant DM potential, plus
the contribution of a third stellar component that accounts for possible
sources of contamination. The model-data comparison accounts for the kinematics
and metallicities of individual stars, allowing us to assign probabilities of
membership to each star. The modeling is applied on the largest available set
of spectroscopic data, which have not been previously analyzed with this
objective. We find the DM distribution of Sculptor to have a logarithmic inner
slope of 0.39+0.23-0.26 and a scale radius of 0.79+0.38-0.17 kpc at 1 sigma
confidence level. Our results show that Sculptor DM density profile deviates
from predictions of DM-only simulations at a 3 sigma level over a large range
of radii. Our analysis suggests that the velocity distribution of Sculptor's
two main stellar components is isotropic in the center and becomes radially
anisotropic in the outskirts. Additionally, we provide predictions for the
projected radial and tangential velocity dispersion profiles. We also present
updated DM annihilation and decay J- and D-factors, finding J = 18.15+0.11-0.12

required by the Etherington reciprocity theorem, which connects the angular
diameter distance and the luminosity distance via the relation \( D_{\rm L}(z)
= D_{\rm A}(z)(1+z)^2 \). Our analysis is based on the latest baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) measurements provided by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)/Extended BOSS (eBOSS), and the
Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) surveys. Specifically, an unbiased
test of the CDDR is performed through a novel, model-independent method
inspired by the two-point diagnostic approach, with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon type
Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample reconstructed using the Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) technique. This methodology effectively eliminates all nuisance
parameters, including the sound horizon scale \( r_{\rm d} \) from BAO and the
absolute magnitude \( M_{\rm B} \) from SN Ia. A set of \( N-1 \) independent
CDDR ratios \( \eta_{ij} \) are constructed for statistical analysis. At the
current observational level, no significant deviation from the CDDR is observed
at low redshifts, whereas we find positive evidence ($>2\sigma$ C.L.) of
deviation from the CDDR at two high redshifts ($z=2.33$ and $z=2.334$).
Therefore, our results confirm that the BAO measurement provides a powerful

  directly using the dust scattered x-ray halo of GRB 221009A</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Albert Sneppen, Darach Watson</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A, 13 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> X-ray scattering is a powerful probe of the optical constants and grain size
distribution of interstellar dust. Bright, transient sources are excellent
tools for this, since they fade rapidly, leaving only the expanding scattered
x-ray halo. Here, we analyse the dust-scattered x-ray halo data of the
unprecedentedly bright $\gamma$-ray burst, GRB 221009A, using anomalous
diffraction theory to measure the grain size distribution of dust in the Galaxy
as well as the complex refractive index, $m$, and use these results to infer
the likely composition. We find a complex refractive index, $m=n+ik$ at several
x-ray energies, finding $k_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (2.7 \pm 0.7)\times10^{-4}$ and
$1-n_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (9 \pm 2)\times 10^{-4}$, strongly inconsistent with
the commonly employed assumptions of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation. These
results lie in the expected range for interstellar dust compositions dominated
by carbon, magnesium silicates, and iron. The absorption results suggest a
substantial mass fraction of iron at $35\pm7\%$. The MRN distribution fit
returns a maximum grain radius, $a_{\rm max}=0.24\pm 0.01\,\mu$m; all fits
strongly rule out models with $\sim0.4\,\mu$m grains for this sightline. The
soft x-ray spectrum of the prompt GRB can also be inferred from the fitting,
with the best-fit providing a spectral slope that is consistent with the slope
of the low energy side of the best-fit Band model of the directly measured
prompt emission. Forcing a different grain size or composition than the best
fit results in an inferred prompt spectrum different to the observed prompt
emission. The refractive index is consistent with standard average dust
compositions, showing that x-ray scattering is an effective tool to measure
interstellar dust optical properties. [abridged]</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13108v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation Pathways of Compact Elliptical Galaxies: Perspective of
  Internal Structures</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yi Jinwon, Soo-Chang Rey, Suk Kim, Youngdae Lee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a structural analysis of 138 compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) in
the redshift range of $z < 0.05$ using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12
data. We perform single- and double-component S\'ersic model fitting to their
SDSS $r$-band surface brightness profiles. By dividing cEs into those with
[cE(w)] and without [cE(w/o)] a bright host galaxy, we find a significant
structural dichotomy: the majority ($\sim$85\%) of cE(w)s exhibit
single-component profiles, while a similar proportion ($\sim$85\%) of isolated
cE(w/o)s display double-component profiles, characterized by a compact, inner
component and a diffuse, disk-like outer component. These results suggest that
host-associated cE(w)s primarily form through the tidal stripping of larger
progenitors, resulting in a compact bulge-like core. In contrast, isolated
cE(w/o)s appear to form intrinsically at early epochs, likely through gas-rich
mergers, and retain disk-like outer structures. The S\'ersic index distribution
of cE(w)s with single-component structure indicates progenitor types ranging
from pseudo-bulge to classical bulge, supported by differences in stellar
populations. A small fraction of cEs, including double-component cE(w)s and
single-component cE(w/o)s, suggests complex evolutionary channels involving
environmental capture or ejection. Our results emphasize that the structural
characteristics of cEs, specifically the presence or absence of an extended
outer envelope, serve as a crucial diagnostic tool to distinguish tidally
stripped remnants from intrinsically formed low-mass cEs in isolation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12136v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Star Formation in Radio Survey: Adding 90 GHz Data to 3-33 GHz
  Observations of Star-forming Regions in Nearby Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anna Dignan, Eric J. Murphy, Brian Mason, Cosima Eibensteiner, Brandon S. Hensley, Eric F.

Turner</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 27 pages, 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present 90 GHz continuum imaging of 119 star-forming regions in 30 nearby
galaxies observed with MUSTANG-2 on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope as
part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey. The 90 GHz data were combined with
3, 15, and 33 GHz data taken previously by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
to decompose radio spectra on $\approx$0.8 kpc scales into their synchrotron,
free-free, and thermal dust emission components. This was done using three
scenarios: (i) a power law fit from 3 to 33 GHz, (ii) Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) fitting from 3 to 90 GHz with a thermal dust component, and (iii) MCMC
fitting from 3 to 33 GHz without a thermal dust component. For these cases, we
find a median thermal (free-free) emission fraction at 33 GHz of (i) $88 \pm
2$% with a scatter of 17%, (ii) $76\pm 3$% with a scatter of 25%, and (iii)
$84\pm 2$% with a scatter of 18%. From this we conclude that, on average,
free-free, not thermal dust, remains the dominant emission component at 33 GHz.
While scenario (ii) yields a thermal fraction that is $\approx$10% larger than
scenario (iii), this difference decreases to $\approx$5% after AGN are removed.
Consequently, star formation rates measured with thermal fractions at 33 GHz
are only mildly biased high without 90 GHz data for the spectral decomposition.
Furthermore, a power law fit of data from 3 to 33 GHz still provides a reliable
estimate of the free-free emission at 33 GHz.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12717v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Rotating Bulge and Halo in the Milky Way: Evidence of Angular

exhibit angular momentum, although the origin and evolution of this prograde
signature remain ambiguous. One plausible scenario involves secular evolution
induced by the central bar and spiral arms. In this study, we identified a
component consisting of 1,175,737 stars with net rotation through the
application of a neural network (NN) method. To investigate the composition of
this rotating sample and the origin of its rotation, we conducted a test
particle simulation incorporating an equilibrium axisymmetric background
potential together with a central decelerating bar. The test particles were
generated using a distribution function (DF) model derived from observational
constraints. Our results indicate that the decelerating bar transfers angular
momentum to the pseudo-stars, and the rotational profile from our simulation
shows strong agreement with observational data. These findings suggest that the
rotating sample identified by our NN model predominantly comprises bulge, halo,
and thick disk stars, and that the central decelerating bar is pivotal in
shaping the inner Galaxy's kinematics through angular momentum transfer.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12175v1" target="_blank"><h2>PEARLS: Twenty-One Transients Found in the Three-Epoch NIRCam

observations covering 14.16 arcmin^2 in the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field (IDF),
taken by the JWST Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing
Science (PEARLS) program in Cycle 1 with a time cadence of ~6 months. A
separate HST program provided complementary ACS optical imaging contemporaneous
with the second and third epochs of the NIRCam observations. Spectroscopic
identifications were carried out for three transients using the NIRSpec
instrument. One of them was confirmed to be a Type Ia supernova at z=1.63,
while the other two had their host galaxies identified at $z=2.64$ and 1.90,
respectively. Combining these redshifts with the photometric redshifts of the
host galaxies in the rest of the sample, we find that the transients are either
in a "mid-z" group at z>1.6 with M_V < -16.0 mag or a "low-z" group at z<0.4
with M_H > -14.0 mag. The mid-z transients are consistent with various types of
supernovae. In contrast, by their luminosities, the low-z transients fall in
the range of the so-called ``gap transients'' between those of supernovae and
classical novae. While they might contain some known types of gap transients
(e.g., supernova impostors and luminous red novae), there could also be new
kinds of transients. To reveal their nature, we will need a long-term,
multi-band NIRCam monitoring program with a higher cadence and prompt NIRSpec
follow-up spectroscopy. Being in the continuous viewing zone of the JWST, the
IDF is an ideal field for such a future program.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11931v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effective supernova dust yields from rotating and non-rotating stellar

at high redshift. However, the reverse shock generated by the interaction of
the SN forward shock and the interstellar medium (ISM) significantly reduces
the mass of newly formed dust in SN ejecta. This study quantifies the mass,
composition, and grain size distribution of surviving dust after the passage of
the reverse shock using the GRASHrev model. Our analysis covers a grid of SN
models with progenitor masses $13\,M_\odot\leq m_\star\leq120M_\odot$,
metallicity $-3\leq\text{[Fe/H]}\leq0$, and rotation velocities $v = 0$ and
$300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The SN explosions occur in a uniform ISM with
densities $n_\text{ISM} = 0.05, 0.5$, and $5\text{ cm}^{-3}$. We find that the
larger grains ($\gtrsim10\text{ nm}$) are more resistant to destruction by the
reverse shock, with amorphous carbon dominating the surviving dust mass in most
models. The surviving dust mass decreases with increasing ISM density. For
non-rotating progenitors, the maximum mass of dust surviving the passage of the
reverse shock is $\simeq 0.02\,M_\odot$ released by SN explosions of a
$120\,M_\odot$ progenitor with $\text{[Fe/H]}=0$ in the ISM density
$0.5\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to $\simeq4\%$ of the initial dust mass
before the passage of the reverse shock. Among rotating progenitors, a maximum
surviving mass fraction is $\simeq5\%$ with a final dust mass
$\simeq0.03\,M_\odot$ in $\text{[Fe/H]}=-1$ models. Although the reverse shock
has a strong destructive impact, our results indicate that, on very short
timescales, SNe can enrich the ISM with carbonaceous grains ranging in size
from approximately $1\text{ nm}$ to $100\text{ nm}$ (up to
$\simeq1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ in non-rotating models). This is notable given the
detection of the 2175 \r{A} extinction bump in galaxies at $z>6$, suggesting
the early presence of such dust.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11840v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar Velocity Dispersion versus Age: Consistency across Observations
  and Simulations, with the Milky Way as an Outlier</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Fiona McCluskey, Andrew Wetzel, Sarah Loebman, Jorge Moreno</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages (30 with references and appendices), to be submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Within disk galaxies, the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of stars increases
with age, $\tau$, as measured in the Milky Way (MW) and nearby galaxies. This
relation provides a key window into galactic formation history, tracing both
the kinematics of stars at birth and the dynamical heating of stars after
birth. We compile and compare observational measurements of the MW, M31, M33,
and 16 galaxies from the PHANGS survey. The MW exhibits significantly colder
stellar kinematics, with 2-3 times lower $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ at a given
age, than all but one other observed galaxy. Therefore, the MW is a kinematic
outlier. To assess how measurement effects influence $\sigma(\tau)$, we analyze
the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, quantifying the impact of uncertainties in
stellar age, aperture size, galactocentric radius, and galaxy inclination.
Aperture size and galactocentric radius affect $\sigma(\tau)$ by up to a factor
of $\approx2$ for stars younger than 100 Myr, with milder effects on older
stars. Age uncertainties up to 40\% change the \textit{value} of $\sigma(\tau)$
at a given age by $\lesssim20\%$ but can reshape the relation with age and
erase merger signatures. We compare $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ in FIRE-2
simulations with observations. FIRE-2 agrees well with M31 and M33 at all
measured ages, and with PHANGS for stars older than $\approx500$ Myr. The
average $\sigma(\tau)/v_{\phi,0}$ in FIRE-2 is about two times higher than the
MW at most ages, but the youngest stars show better agreement. The velocity
ratios ($\sigma_{\phi}/\sigma_{R}$, $\sigma_{Z}/\sigma_{\phi}$,
$\sigma_{Z}/\sigma_{R}$) in FIRE-2 broadly agree with the MW. We conclude that
$\sigma(\tau)$ in FIRE-2, and most cosmological zoom-in simulations, reasonably
matches observed nearby galaxies, but matching the MW is rare, because it is a
kinematic outlier.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13636v1" target="_blank"><h2>KRIOS: A new basis-expansion $N$-body code for collisional stellar
  dynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kerwann Tep, Brian T. Cook, Carl L. Rodriguez, Jiya Jolly, Eddie Sawin, Michael S. Petersen, Christoph Gaffud</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The gravitational $N$-body problem is a nearly universal problem in
astrophysics which, despite its deceptive simplicity, still presents a
significant computational challenge. For collisional systems such as dense star
clusters, the need to resolve individual encounters between $N$ stars makes the
direct summation of forces - with quadratic complexity - almost infeasible for
systems with $N\gtrsim 10^6$ particles over many relaxation times. At the same
time, the most common Monte Carlo $N$-body algorithm - that of H\'enon -
assumes the cluster to be spherically symmetric. This greatly limits the study
of many important features of star clusters, including triaxiality, rotation,
and the production of tidal debris. In this paper, we present a new hybrid
code, KRIOS, that combines 3D collisionless relaxation using an adaptive
self-consistent field method with a collisional dynamics part handled via
H\'enon's method. We demonstrate that KRIOS can accurately model the long-term
evolution of clusters and provide its complete phase-space information over
many relaxation times. As a test of our new code, we present detailed
comparisons to two well-known results from stellar dynamics: (i) the
collisional evolution of an isotropic Plummer sphere to core collapse, and (ii)
the emergence of the radial-orbit instability in radially anisotropic star
clusters, including its non-spherical effects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12132v1" target="_blank"><h2>Collision-induced mass loss and mass gain on an extremely massive star.
  An analytical approach and a static proto-globular cluster test-case</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Laura Ramírez-Galeano, Corinne Charbonnel, Tassos Fragos, Zoubaïr Tazakkati, Jaime Roman-Garza, Mark Gieles</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The objective of this study is to analytically explore mass loss and gain
induced by stellar collisions on a gas-accreting extremely massive star (aEMS,
10^3 <= M/M_sun <= 10^4). We also consider its contribution to the mass budget
in the context of forming multiple stellar populations in a typical
protoglobular cluster. We used MESA to build a series of aEMS models up to 2e4
M_sun for three [Fe/H] values, covering the metallicity range of Galactic GCs,
with different treatments of super-adiabatic convection. We set analytical
prescriptions to quantify collision-induced mass loss when a star spirals in
and deposits energy into the envelope of the aEMS. We used a Monte Carlo
approach to simulate the effects of multiple collisions on an aEMS of initial
mass 10^3 M_sun in a static proto-GC, accounting for mass loss and gain from
collisions, gas accretion, and stellar winds. We show that assumptions on
super-adiabaticity in radiation-dominated layers significantly impact aEMS
properties and their collision responses: extended stars tend to lose mass,
while compact ones are more likely to gain it. Our MC simulations predict total
mass lost and gained, along with timescales and contributions from winds and
collisions. The results depend on both the aEMS structure and the gas accretion
rate during the collision phase. Under certain conditions, the EMS shows a
"conveyor belt" behavior, processing up to 10^5.5 M_sun of material in 5 Myr.
This study provides theoretical predictions supporting aEMSs as contributors to
the abundance anomalies observed in GCs. It emphasizes the need to include
collision dynamics and mass transfer in aEMS formation and evolution models in
dense stellar environments. We provide a grid of predictions for stellar
M-R-[Fe/H]-structure relations and collision-induced mass loss and gain,
suitable for hydro and N-body simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12709v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on Dark Energy Models Using Late Universe Probes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shubham Barua, Shantanu Desai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages, 17 figures.

parameterizations, the constrained values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ remain within
$(1-2)\sigma$ of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, irrespective of spatial
curvature, dataset combinations, or prior choices. We find from Bayesian model
comparison that $\Lambda$CDM remains the most favored model for both flat and
non-flat cases, with results remaining robust under different priors. Across
all dataset combinations, we reaffirm the fact that LRG1 and LRG2 data points
from the DESI BAO dataset are responsible for driving the preference for

$\Lambda$ within a Bayesian analysis. In this work, we validate that
frequentist constraints from profile likelihoods on the

with the Bayesian constraints when combining with Planck cosmic microwave
background, Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing, and either
Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey Y5 supernova data. Further, we assess which
datasets drive these constraints by considering the contributions to the
$\chi^2$ from the individual datasets. For profile likelihoods of the matter
fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, such an investigation shows internal
inconsistencies when assuming $\Lambda$, which are resolved when assuming a
$w_0w_a$ dark-energy model. We infer the equations of state $w(z)$ at the pivot
redshifts, supporting previous interpretations that current data appears to be
more sensitive to the derivative of $w(z)$ rather than a mean offset from

field and density spectra are peaked at sub-horizon wavenumbers. Starting with
the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system, we derive the scale-dependent evolution of
the matter power spectrum during radiation and matter domination. We find a
suppression of adiabatic perturbations during radiation domination, controlled
by a free-streaming length, and scale-dependent growth of the initially
white-noise isocurvature power, controlled by a Jeans scale during matter
domination. The results are in qualitative, and in some regimes quantitative,
agreement with the quasi-particle picture. We verify the analytic results of
the power spectrum with 3+1-dimensional cosmological Schr\"odinger-Poisson
simulations. We propose an analytic formula for the halo mass function, which
is in rough agreement with the simulation results at early times after
matter-radiation equality. Our simulations show that early halos typically host

phenylium--the cyclic structure of the \ce{C6H5+} species--is unreactive toward
key interstellar molecules such as molecular hydrogen (\ce{H2}) and acetylene
(\ce{C2H2}). This finding challenges the previously proposed role of phenylium
as a cornerstone in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
\cite{cherchneff1992,byrne2024}. Here, we present new experimental and
theoretical evidence that challenge this assumption. The study focused on the
reactivity of \ce{C6H5+}, formed via the radiative association between
\ce{C4H3+} and \ce{C2H2}, believed to be a major pathway for phenylium
formation. Our results demonstrate that phenylium does indeed react with
\ce{C2H2} under astrophysically relevant conditions. Quantum chemical
calculations support this finding by revealing a barrierless mechanism,
indicating that the reaction is feasible even in cold interstellar
environments. We believe this clarification is critically important, as the
conclusions of Kocheril et al. could mislead the community and hinder further
investigations into the formation of the first aromatic ring in space--a
process that remains a key bottleneck in our understanding of PAHs formation
and growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11568v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing the outer disk of eXtended-UV galaxies in the optical

Galaz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 10 figures, accepted in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Aims : Extended-UV (XUV) galaxies are galaxies presenting an extended outer
ultraviolet disks. Although some Giant Low Surface Brightness (GLSB) galaxies
are also XUV, their relation has been seldom studied. This work aims to
determine whether a sample of nine XUV galaxies can be classified as GLSBs, by
analyzing their photometric properties in deep optical images. Method : The
method presented here uses optical data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to
construct surface brightness (SB) profiles for each galaxy. A characteristic UV
radius is defined to examine the XUV disks. The surface brightness profiles are
fitted using simple exponential functions, and the extracted parameters are
compared with the literature to identify possible GLSB galaxies. We examined
also other diagnostics, including color profiles. Results : The analysis of the
optical surface brightness profiles of XUV galaxies reveal that they can be
classified into three different families. One third meet the GLSB criteria in
terms of diffuseness, another third are regular, and the remaining have a
stronger decline in the outer disk than in the inner disk, opposite to GLSBs.
The color profiles allowed us, in addition to distinguish one of the galaxy,
NGC1140, likely resulting from a rare dwarf-dwarf merger.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13424v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersions across a Local arm segment</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lixia Yuan, Ji Yang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Using a large sample of 9617 molecular clouds (MCs) from the Milky Way
Imaging Scroll Painting survey, we mainly measure one-dimensional
cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersions across a 450 deg$^{2}$ segment of the Local
arm in the Galactic second quadrant. We define the cloud-to-cloud velocity
dispersion using two metrics: the standard deviation ($\sigma_{\rm bin}$) and
flux-weighted root-mean-squared value ($\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$) of the centroid
velocities of $^{12}$CO-detected MCs within spatial bins. The typical values of
$\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$ are 7.5$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and
6.2$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. After categorizing clouds by sizes into
three types: Type $S$ (0.15 $-$ 1.2 pc), Type $M$ (1.2 $-$ 4.8 pc), and Type L
($\gtrsim$ 4.8 pc), we find that the spatial distribution of Type $S$ and $M$
MCs projected onto the Galactic longitude-latitude (l-b) plane is generally
uniform. Additionally, the cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion among Type $S$
clouds ($\sim$ 7.6 and 7.4 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm
bin, w}$, respectively) is systematically greater than that among Type $M$
clouds ($\sim$ 6.7 and 6.0 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm
bin, w}$, respectively), with differences of 0.9 $-$ 1.4 km s$^{-1}$. From
these measurements, we estimate merger timescales between MCs to be
approximately 0.3 to 0.9 Myr, which is shorter than their internal crossing
timescales ($\sim$ 1 Myr for Type $S$, $\sim$ 2 Myr for Type $M$, and $\gtrsim$
5 Myr for Type $L$). This disparity, particularly pronounced for larger Type
$L$ clouds, suggests that MCs are dynamically transient structures, with their
gas content changing due to frequent interactions with neighboring clouds.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12221v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effective Viscosity in the Intracluster Medium During Magnetic Field

anisotropies and high viscosity. High-$\beta$ plasmas, dominated by thermal

anisotropy, reduce viscosity, and enable small-scale dynamo-driven magnetic
amplification. This study examines viscosity evolution in the ICM during
turbulent magnetic field amplification. We performed 3D MHD simulations of
forced turbulence with an initially weak, uniform magnetic field. Using the
CGL-MHD framework, we incorporate anisotropic pressure dynamics and
instability-driven anisotropy limitation. We analyze effective viscosity and
dynamo evolution, comparing results with Braginskii-MHD and uniform-viscosity
MHD. Results show viscosity decreases over time, allowing magnetic field
amplification to saturation levels similar to non-viscous MHD. Viscosity
distribution becomes bimodal, reflecting (i) collisional values and (ii)
turbulence-dominated values proportional to $10^{-4} L_{\rm turb} U_{\rm turb}$
in unstable regions. At saturation, 60% of plasma retains collisional
viscosity. Braginskii-MHD reproduces similar magnetic amplification and
viscosity structures. However, uniform-viscosity MHD, where viscosity equals
the mean saturated CGL-MHD value, fails to capture the turbulence inertial
range. These findings highlight the need for anisotropic viscosity models in
studying ICM processes like magnetic topology, cosmic ray transport, and
AGN-driven shocks. Moreover, our CGL-MHD and Braginskii-MHD models match the
Coma cluster density fluctuation spectrum, reinforcing its weakly collisional
nature.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11758v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the
  Weighted Function Regression method</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alex González-Fuentes, Adrià Gómez-Valent</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 36 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with
CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$
CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the
DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor
expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary
and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake
spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of
DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to
eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We
assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior
distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic
approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities,
examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa
likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE.
Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for
the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and
SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence
at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies
between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a
simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim
2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark
energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the
Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the
Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic
biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11755v1" target="_blank"><h2>Phase space and Data analyses of a non-minimally coupled scalar field

Shahalam</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models non-minimally
coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and
parameterized coupling {\xi}. First, we study the cosmological dynamics for a
recently proposed Q-SC-CDM model. Initially, we choose two distinct values of
{\xi}: 0.1 and 0.5. In case of {\xi}=0.1, the evolution of the universe is
split up into three different phases: deceleration, acceleration and
slow-contraction, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future.
However, in case of {\xi}=0.5, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes,
correspondingly Big Crunch Singularity is redundant. Second, we perform the
phase space analysis for Q-SC-CDM, bring new asymptotic regimes and find stable
de-Sitter solution. Finally, fixing {\xi} to two representative values: {\xi} =
0.1 and 0.05, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent
late-time cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type
Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI
DR2) data. Our results demonstrate that both models yield constraints on key
cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are
consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild
tension with Pantheon+ measurements. We analyze the evolution of the effective
equation of state, showing that the model transitions from a stiff matter phase
at high redshift to a dark energy dominated phase with effective equation of
state less than -0.5 at late times. Additionally, we employ the Om(z)
diagnostic to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM, finding minimal
deviation up to redshift z \sim 2. Statistical model comparison using Akaike
(AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) Information Criteria reveals moderate support for the
model with {\xi} = 0.1, though {\Lambda}CDM remains statistically preferred.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13262v1" target="_blank"><h2>Validation of Fast Mocks Generation for CSST Photometric Survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yiming Hu, Yu Yu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Weak lensing has become a powerful tool for probing the matter distribution
in the Universe and constraining cosmological parameters. This paper aims to
explore the fast mock generation pipeline to obtain the covariance matrix of
the $3\times 2$pt analysis for the upcoming China Space Station Telescope
(CSST). We adopt the $N_\mathrm{side}$ pipeline, which generates matter
distribution with lognormal assumptions, to create full-sky galaxy mocks with
certain two-point statistics. We also employ the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
simulation to test the accuracy of the covariance matrix from the
mock-generated galaxy catalogue. Our work validates the accuracy of the
$3\times 2$pt statistics in both spherical harmonic space and real space. The
critical scale below which the fractional error of correlation exceeds 1$\%$
can decrease as the resolution parameter $N_\mathrm{side}$ increases. After
excluding certain scales, the covariance matrix from the mock-generated galaxy
catalogue can constrain the cosmological parameters with 0.1$\%$ accuracy. This
work demonstrates the potential of $\texttt{GLASS}$ for real-space cosmological
measurements and highlights the importance of discarding appropriate scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11826v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing Coasting Cosmologies with Large-Scale Structure Growth</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dávid A. Ködmön, Péter Raffai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We derive analytical expressions for the growth factor, $D(z)$, and
density-weighted growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$, for coasting cosmologies, in
which the scale factor is a linear function of time. We fit the latter to data
from redshift space distortion measurements in the redshift range $z<2$ using
the \texttt{dynesty} implementation of a nested sampling algorithm. In total,
four models are tested: three coasting models with curvature parameters
${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ in $H^2_0c^{-2}$ units, as well as a flat $\Lambda$CDM
model. We evaluate each model's consistency with the data by applying an
Anderson-Darling test for normality on the normalized residuals. For the
coasting models, we obtained ${\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=\{
0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\,
0.412^{+0.097}_{-0.086}}\}$ and

Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM model yielded
${\{\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053},\,\sigma_{8}(z=0)=
0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}\}}$. All four models are consistent with the data,
though coasting models are weakly favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with
$\log$-Bayes factors of ${\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{0.197,\,
0.234,\,0.272\}}$. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved
by linear expansion restricted to $z<2$. The curve fitting yielded
${S_8=\{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}}$

${\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{1.94\sigma,\,1.07\sigma,\,0.52\sigma\}}$
discrepancies with the standard $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 value. The tension level
was the highest for the $\Lambda$CDM model, as the constraint from our fit is
$S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta

  Known?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Philip Massey, Sarah Bodansky, Laura R. Penny, Kathryn F. Neugent</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The star NGC 3603-A1 has long been known to be a very massive binary,
consisting of a pair of O2-3If*/WN5-6 stars, which show Wolf-Rayet-like
emission due to their luminosities being near the Eddington limit. The system
has been poorly characterized until now, due to the difficulties of obtaining
reliable radial velocities from broad, blended emission lines and the extreme
crowding in the cluster. However, previously unpublished archival HST/STIS
spectra revealed that some of the upper Balmer lines (seen in absorption) are
well separated at favorable orbital phases, prompting us to obtain our own
carefully-timed new HST/STIS spectra, which we have analyzed along with the
older data. Radial velocities measured from these spectra allow us to obtain an
orbit for this 3.77298 day system. We also used archival STIS imaging of the
cluster to obtain a more accurate light curve for this eclipsing system, which
we then modeled, yielding the orbital inclination and providing values for the
stellar radii and temperatures. Together, these data show that the NGC 3603-A1
system consists of a 93.3+/-11.0 Mo O3If*/WN6 primary with an effective
temperature of 37,000 K, and a 70.4+/-9.3 Mo O3If*/WN5 secondary that is
slightly hotter, 42,000 K. Although a more massive binary is known in the LMC,
NGC 3603-A1 is the most massive binary in our own Galaxy for which a direct
measurement of its mass has been made by a fundamental method. The secondary
has been spun up by mass accretion from the primary, and we discuss the
evolutionary status of this intriguing system.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13288v1" target="_blank"><h2>Decay of dark energy into dark matter in a metric $f(R)$ gravity:
  effective running Hubble constant</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Giovanni Montani, Mariaveronica De Angelis, Maria Giovanna Dainotti</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We examine a modified late-Universe dynamics where dark energy decays into
dark matter, within the framework of metric $f(R)$-gravity in the Jordan frame.
After a detailed analysis of the modified $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model, we
introduce a theoretical diagnostic tool to capture the emergence of an
effective running Hubble constant as a function of redshift. We then compare
this theoretical model with the 40-bin analysis of the Supernova Pantheon
sample. This comparison allows us to determine the value of the additional free
parameter that appears in our model, beyond those of the standard $\Lambda
\text{CDM}$ model. Our modified late Universe dynamics provides a good-quality
fit to the binned data, improving upon the previous phenomenological
interpretation based on a power-law decay. However, unlike the power-law model,
our approach cannot be extrapolated to the recombination redshift to match the
Hubble constant measured by the Planck satellite. In fact, the dynamics
resulting from the binned Pantheon sample analysis address only weakly the
Hubble tension between the SH0ES and the Planck Collaboration values of the
Hubble constant. Here we provide a convincing representation of the observed
deviation of the cosmological dynamics from the $\Lambda$CDM-one, as it
out-stands from the low redshift observed sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13124v1" target="_blank"><h2>Parameter Recovery Study on IZI -- a Bayesian Analysis Tool for Emission

analysis tool IZI, which analyses emission lines from H II regions and
star-forming galaxies and returns the estimates of the gas metallicity 12 + log
(O/H), ionisation parameter log q, and nebular emission-line colour excess
E(B-V). We created several mock datasets using IZI to represent a few different
ideal or realistic datasets and performed parameter estimation on the mock data
with IZI. We found that IZI underestimated or overestimated the parameters by
approximately 1-$\sigma$ or greater when the model error was included, even
when using all emission lines available in the model grids. We strongly
recommend that IZI users run parameter recovery tests adjusted for their data
before interpreting the IZI estimates. To encourage the appropriate use of IZI,
we also share a script for parameter recovery tests. The cause of IZI's biased
estimation is the substantial model error in the likelihood term, which varies
with the model parameters. We thus note that any parameter estimation with a
substantial, varying model error in the likelihood term could return biased
estimates for the model parameters, such as in the case of NebulaBayes, another
Bayesian analysis tool for photoionisation emission lines. We also note two
issues relevant to setting the log q prior using the observed line ratio [S
III]$\lambda$$\lambda$9068,9532/[S II]$\lambda$6717,6731 (the mismatch of line
flux terms and violation of Bayes' theorem) and propose a way to avoid the

Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the acceleration and collimation of the two-sided jets in the nearby
low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4261 (3C 270) using archival
multifrequency, multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array data. By applying multiple
analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we robustly
identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and
counterjet, with the transition occurring at $(1.23\pm0.24)\,$pc or
$(8.1\pm1.6)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and
$(0.97\pm0.29)\,$pc or $(6.4\pm1.9)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ for the counterjet.
Assuming that the brightness asymmetry between the twin jets is primarily due
to relativistic Doppler (de)boosting, we derive the jet velocity field at
distances of $\sim (10^3-2\times10^4)\,R_{\rm s}$ based on the
jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio and spectral index. Although local kinematic
variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic
speeds from $\sim 10^3$ to $\sim8\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$, with a maximum Lorentz
factor of $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx 2.6$. Beyond this region, the jet gradually
decelerates to sub-relativistic speeds. These results support the existence of
a (sub)parsec-scale ($\lesssim 1.5\,$pc) acceleration and collimation zone
(ACZ) in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy
conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M
87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analogue of
that in M 87.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12135v1" target="_blank"><h2>Luminous, rapidly declining supernovae as stripped transitional objects

2022lxg, a bright ($\rm M_{g\, \mathrm{peak}}=-19.41$ mag) and rapidly evolving
SN. It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in
10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data.
The first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $>15,000$ K) with
flash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase
is marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the
shapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~
$150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving
unshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast
decline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\pm$ 0.26 mag $\rm (50\,d)^{-1}$ in
$g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until
$+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a
transition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II.
However, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d.
Its remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\rm M_B$ ~
$-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC
value - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence
(including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations
from spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the
observational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass
transfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before
it underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be
more compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow
supergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12974v1" target="_blank"><h2>First detection of HS2 in a cold dark cloud</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  G.

confirmed by the observation of the fine and hyperfine components of two

temperature of 7 K, we derived an HS2 column density of 5.7x10^11 cm-2, using a
local thermodynamic equilibrium model that reproduces the observed spectra. The
abundance of HS2 relative to H2 is 5.7x10^-11, which means that it is about
seven times more abundant than its oxygenated counterpart HSO. We also explored
the main formation and destruction mechanisms of HS2 using a chemical model,
which reproduces the observed abundance of HS2 and indicates that dissociative

astrophysical distribution function, and is defined as the mass distribution
for stars formed in a single star-formation event and when they just enter the
main-sequence stage. The measurement of IMF is challenging even in the solar
neighbourhood where IMF can be extracted by star-counting. This is because the
definition of the IMF should be handled cautiously, and there are multiple
corrections should be made from observation to a well-founded measurement. We
present a new parametrisation of the stellar IMF in the 100-pc solar
neighbourhood, leveraging the astrometric and photometric data from
\textsl{Gaia} DR3: we model the colour-magnitude diagram of the field star
population while accounting for observational uncertainties, Malmquist bias,
Lutz-Kelker bias, the effect of varying mass-luminosity relation caused by
mixture of different metallicity, and the effect of unresolved binaries. In
particular, we synthesise the binaries with a process imitating the dynamical
evolution observed in star clusters to model their present-day mass-ratio
distribution. We derive a stellar IMF consistent with canonical IMFs but with
significantly reduced uncertainties: $\alpha_1=0.81^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$,
$\alpha_2=2.12^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and a break point at
$m_{\mathrm{break}}=0.41^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Our model also
constrains the binary fraction to $\sim$25\% and the \textsl{Gaia} DR3 angular
resolution to $1.31^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ arcsec. We also provide the
$\xi$-parameter for our IMF to be $0.5075_{-0.0051}^{+0.0112}$ for the users to

jet of BL~ Lacertae highlighted its significance in evaluating the physical
properties of relativistic transverse waves in the parsec-scale jet. Motivated
by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum
radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of
0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data
at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the
3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and
estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to
estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and
refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC
position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about
$21\degr$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\approx
0.30\degr \pm 0.03\degr$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit
strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced
anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean
intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\overline{\beta_{\rm s}}
\approx 15$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the
seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse
wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the
QSC enables the classification and characterization of reversal patterns,
which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such
as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave

to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for
curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based
inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically
designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary
statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift
bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the
likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback
effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti
numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and
$\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from
cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results
demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework
for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily
applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13047v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simple quintessence models in light of DESI-BAO observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  James M. Cline, Varun Muralidharan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 4 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent analyses from the DESI collaboration suggest that the dark energy
density of the Universe may be decreasing with time, slowing the acceleration
of the scale factor $a$. Typically these studies are performed assuming an
ansatz for the equation of state $w(a)$. In this work, we instead consider
simple models of a scalar quintessence potential with linear and quadratic
behavior, which could be more representative of real models than particular
parametrizations of $w(a)$. We observe a significant preference for dynamical
dark energy when using supernova data from DESY5 along with DESI BAO and Planck
data, at the cost of slightly exacerbating the Hubble tension. However, when
using supernova data from Pantheon+ or Union3, we find only a mild preference
for dynamical dark energy.</p></br></body>
