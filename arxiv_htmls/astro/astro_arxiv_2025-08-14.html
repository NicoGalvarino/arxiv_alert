  of a Cosmic Filament</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Qiong Li, Christopher J. Conselice, Qiao Duan, Duncan Austin, Tom Harvey, Nathan Adams, George Bendo, Lewi Westcott, Vadim Rusakov, Zheng Cai, Yuanhang Ning, Shiwu Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (abstract), JWST (abstract), outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), high redshift (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN
systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and
powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar
medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its
surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended
Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is
challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \sim 5.4$
using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\sim1.7$ arcseconds
($\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed
redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent
agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT
diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs.
VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, extending to
$>22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z \sim 6$.
This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization
or shocks. The high Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow.
This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity,
potentially at the center of a $z \sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary
structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is
significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This
discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their
impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09514v1" target="_blank"><h2>Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the circumgalactic medium -- II:

medium (CGM) of $\approx$2.5 million $\rm M_{200}$=$\rm 10^{12-14}\,M_\odot$
WISE$\times$DESI galaxies out to $z$=1.2. We split the sample into quiescent
(0.7 million) and star-forming (1.8 million) galaxies, exploring the relation
between the thermal pressure of the CGM and star formation for the first time.
We develop and implement a novel probabilistic approach to cross-correlate the
galaxy catalog with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope+Planck data by taking into
account the uncertainties in redshift, mass, and star formation rate. The S/N
of the stacked Compton-$y$ value in the CGM varies from 4.9 to 18.5, depending
on the sample size and the CGM signal strength within the relevant mass bin. We
detect the CGM signal down to $\rm M_{200}=10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$, and provide
stringent upper limit at $\rm M_{200}<10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$. The data fit well
with the standard GNFW profile of thermal pressure and do not require a flatter
or steeper profile. This suggests a significant impact of cooling and the
absence of dominant feedback. In galaxies with $\rm
M_{200}\approx10^{12.3-12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the volume filling CGM is likely
the largest contributor to the $galactic$ baryons at their virial temperatures
of $\sim$10$^{6-6.4}\rm\,K$. For $\rm M_{200}>10^{12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the
most massive phase of the CGM is likely at a sub-virial temperature of
$\rm\gtrsim 10^6\,K$. The thermal energy of the CGM of quiescent galaxies
follows the self-similar relation with mass, but the star-forming galaxies
deviate from this relation. This indicates that the impact of non-gravitational
factors varies among halos of different degrees of star-forming activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09331v1" target="_blank"><h2>Balmer series fluxes from Pop. III Stars: A-SLOTH Predictions for JWST
  Observability</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Veronika Lipatova, Simon C. O. Glover, Ralf S. Klessen, Boyuan Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational
challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the
infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first
opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental
sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first
four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess
their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the
semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended
Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting
Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted
fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time
Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise
ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at
$\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST
detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The
fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are
also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing
photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop.
III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9
to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in
this case, the lines remain undetectable.
  Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be
undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH
provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the
detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09951v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tight correlation of star formation with [Ci] and CO lines across cosmic

Cold molecular gas tracers, such as CI and CO lines, have been
widely used to infer specific characteristics of the ISM and to derive
star-formation relations among galaxies. Aims. However, there is still a lack
of systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI]
lines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used
observations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885
sources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between
line luminosities of $\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\rm
L^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR). With linear regression, we fit
the relations between SFR and molecular mass derived from CO, CI, and CII
lines. Results. The relation between [CI] and CO-based total molecular masses
is weakly superlinear. Nevertheless, they can be calibrated against each other.
For $\rm \alpha_{CO} = 0.8$ and $4.0\ \rm
{M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ we derive $\alpha_{\rm [CI]} =
3.9$ and $\sim$$17\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ ,
respectively. Using the \emph{lmfit} package, we derived relation slopes of
SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}$, SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and SFR--$\rm
L^{'}_{[CII](1-0)}$ to be $\rm \beta$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.02, 1.24 $\pm$ 0.02, and
0.74 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. With a Bayesian-inference \emph{linmix} method,
we find consistent results. Conclusions. Our relations for [CI](1-0) and
CO(1-0) indicate that they trace similar molecular gas contents, across
different redshifts and different types of galaxies. This suggests that these
correlations do not have strong evolution with cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09251v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Interstellar Medium in IZw18 seen with JWST/MIRI: I. Highly Ionized

IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of $\sim$3% Solar. Its
proximity enables a detailed study of highly ionized gas that can be
interpreted in the context of newly discovered high-redshift dwarf galaxies. We
derive aperture spectra centered on eleven regions of interest; the spectra
show very low extinction, A_V $\lesssim 0.1$, consistent with optical
determinations. The gas is highly ionized; we have detected 10 fine-structure
lines, including [OIV] 25.9 micron with an ionization potential (IP) of $\sim$
55 eV, and [NeV] 14.3 micron with an IP of $\sim$ 97 eV. The ionization state
of IZw18 falls at the extreme upper end of all of the line ratios we analyzed,
but not coincident with galaxies containing an accreting massive black hole
(active galactic nucleus). Comparison of the line ratios with state-of-the-art
photoionization and shock models suggests that the high ionization state in
IZw18 is not due to shocks. Rather it can be attributed to metal-poor stellar
populations with a self-consistent contribution of X-ray binaries or
ultra-luminous X-ray sources. It could also be partially due to a small number
of hot low-metallicity Wolf-Rayet stars ionizing the gas; a small fraction (a
few percent) of the ionization could come from an intermediate-mass black hole.
Our spectroscopy also revealed four 14 micron continuum sources, $\gtrsim
30-100$ pc in diameter, three of which were not previously identified. Their
properties are consistent with HII regions ionized by young star clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09282v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical modelling of the lobes of radio galaxies VI. Polarimetric

magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically
symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we
derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres
based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature
profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one
parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current
observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR),
as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the
detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of
mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce
simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM)
synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we
should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of
active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations
of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our
simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization
enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a
demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday
active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps
precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current
technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster
atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties
derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric
atmospheres.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09258v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Promise for the JWST era: Massive black holes directly collapsed from

black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave
CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the
"chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to
prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum
stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic
instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in
spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for
direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs
formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic
of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09914v1" target="_blank"><h2>Powerful Radio Sources as Probes of Black Hole Physics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ruth A.

lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the
supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black
hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of
these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the
efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass
energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two
supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the
independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the
production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that
feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient

Miranda</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A, 9 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the
observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to
a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes
occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy,
it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment
model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars.
It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined.
The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the
predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance.
By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical
structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance
as a function of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with
observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and
SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0
\lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\sim 1.81
\times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\sim 4.4 \times
10^{5} - 1.3 \times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star
in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred
$\sim 2.2 \times 10^{5} - 4.4 \times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau
serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The
abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop
III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\odot}$. However, if some
high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the
contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\odot}$ to the formation of
the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09286v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Compilation and Validation of the Spectroscopic Redshift Catalogs

ten-year monitoring of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser was carried out with the
Torun 32 m radio telescope. The archival data collected so far were also used

the spectrum shows only long-term variability. High-angular-resolution data
indicate that the maser is associated with one of the two 1.3 mm dust emission
