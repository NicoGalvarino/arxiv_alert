We perform 3D lattice field theory simulations with CosmoLattice, considering grid sizes $N = 1250$, $2048$ and $4096$, to study the dynamics of the domain wall network and its GW signatures. We first analyze how the network approaches the scaling regime with a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of domain walls per Hubble volume, including setups with a large initial number of domains as expected in realistic scenarios, and find that scaling is always reached in a few Hubble times after the network formation. To better understand the properties of the scaling regime, we then numerically extract the Equal Time Correlator (ETC) of the energy-momentum tensor of the network, thus determining its characteristic shape for the case of domain walls, and verifying explicitly its functional dependence as predicted by scaling arguments. The ETC can be further extended to the Unequal Time Correlator (UTC) controlling the GW emission by making assumptions on the coherence of the source. By comparison with the actual GW spectrum evaluated by CosmoLattice, we are then able to infer the degree of coherence of the domain wall network. Finally, by performing numerical simulations in different background cosmologies, e.g. radiation domination and kination, we find evidence for a universal ETC at subhorizon scales and hence a universal shape of the GW spectrum in the UV, while the expansion history of the Universe may instead be determined by the IR features of the GW spectrum.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16648v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lucky Strikes: On the Origins of GW190814 Through Isolated Binary Evolution <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ignacio Magaña Hernandez, Katelyn Breivik<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The asymmetric nature of GW190814, particularly its mass ratio ($q \approx 1/10$), has made its astrophysical origin elusive. We explore isolated binary evolution as a potential explanation for GW190814's formation. Using the binary population synthesis code COSMIC, and the backpop sampling technique to map the observed parameters of GW190814 to the initial conditions of Zero Age Main Sequence binary stars while simultaneously inferring the astrophysical prescriptions for common envelope evolution, stable mass transfer and natal kick kinematics that are needed for its formation and eventual merger. We find that the initial conditions for the binary stellar population that forms GW190814 do not stand out significantly from massive star populations observed in the Local Group. Our backpop simulations recover a dominant formation pathway where the first Roche overflow phase includes a common envelope evolution and the second Roche overflow phase remains stable. Our findings suggest that natal kicks imparted during compact object formation play the strongest role in forming GW190814-like systems. Specifically, our models require a low magnitude first natal kick (independent of direction) that prevents the binary from unbinding and a large second natal kick with its direction in the plane of the orbit and toward the binary's center of mass. The second natal kick strength and direction crucially increases the orbital eccentricity, leading to shorter delay times, and thus enabling mergers within a Hubble time. We estimate the chance probability for GW190814-like events that experience such a lucky kick and find that it occurs in $\sim20\%$ of systems if natal kicks are randomly oriented. We discuss the astrophysical implications for the formation of asymmetric GW190814-like systems under the context of binary stellar evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16615v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ensemble broad-frequency power spectrum of Stripe-82 quasars from multiple surveys <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vincenzo Petrecca, Iossif E.

Studying its properties and the correlations with the physical parameters (e.g. black hole mass and accretion rate) provides significant insights into accretion physics. However, the detailed picture and the exact interplay between different emitting regions are not yet clear. We combine data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1, PS1), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Gaia space telescope to constrain the power spectrum of quasars in the Stripe-82 region over a broad frequency range, 10^{-1} to 10^{-3} day^{-1}(rest frame). Light curves are matched and cross-calibrated to reach \sim 20 years in the r-band for 4037 quasars. We split the sample into bins of the same black hole mass, accretion rate, and redshift, and measure the ensemble power spectral density (PSD) in each bin. The power spectra of SDSS, ZTF, and Gaia are measured independently. We do not measure it on PS1 data due to more erratic cadence, but we discuss the use of interpolation techniques, eventually allowing us to use the data together. We find significant evidence that the long-term UV/optical variability of quasars is stationary, as the ensemble PSD estimates from SDSS, Gaia and ZTF are consistent within the errors despite coming from different surveys and years. The PSD shape is consistent with a bending power law with spectral indices of -2.7 and -1 at high and low frequencies. A fit with the PSD associated with a damped random walk is significantly worse. The PSD amplitude below the break does not depend on black hole mass, but there is some evidence for anti-correlation with the accretion rate. The bending frequency, instead, scales with the black hole mass as $ν_b$ \propto M_{\mathrm{BH}}^{-0.6\pm0.1} and does not depend on the accretion rate.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16606v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark energy after pre-recombination early dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and the latest ACT and SPT data <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hao Wang, Yun-Song Piao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 3 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It has been noted that with the pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE) resolution of Hubble tension, the preference of recent datasets for the evolving dark energy (DE) can be suppressed significantly. In this work, we clarify and reconfirm this result with DESI DR2 and the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the tightest small-scale CMB constraints up to date. In the $w_0w_a$CDM model with EDE, a quintessence-like component ($w_0+w_a\geq-1$) can be 1$σ$ consistent with Planck+ACT+SPT+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES datasets, and $Δχ^2\lesssim -14$ compared with $w_0w_a$CDM model without EDE. This reveals the possibility that when the potential resolutions of Hubble tension are considered, current accelerated expansion can attribute to a canonical evolving scalar field or cosmological constant, and again highlights the importance of re-examining the nature of DE within the broader context of cosmological tensions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16464v1" target="_blank"><h2>Collision frequency between dark matter subhaloes within Milky Way-like galaxies <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Koki Otaki, Yudai Kazuno, Masao Mori<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in New Astronomy<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract), haloes (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, sub-galactic structures hierarchically collide and merge to build up larger structures. Mergers and collisions between dwarf galaxies and dark matter subhaloes (DMSHs) play an important role in the evolution and formation of structures within a massive galaxy. We investigate the collision frequency between DMSHs associated with a massive host galaxy such as the Milky Way. We analytically estimate the density distribution of DMSH pairs for the relative distance and relative velocity ($r_\mathrm{rel}$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$) and the distance from the centre of the host halo and relative velocity ($r$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$) planes, based on the distribution function of the host halo in the phase space. Then, we evaluate the collision frequencies of DMSHs by integrating the orbital evolution of DMSHs in Milky-Way-like host haloes selected from cosmological $N$-body simulations. The frequency of violent encounters, in which the relative distance of DMSHs is shorter than the sum of scale radii, is averaged as $2.1\times 10^2\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$. Since the time scale of violent encounters, $4.7\,\mathrm{Myr}$, is shorter than the dynamical time of the host halo, collisions between DMSHs occur frequently within the host halo. Although interactions between DMSHs produce pairs with higher relative velocities, the density distributions of all and colliding pairs between DMSHs provided by numerical results are approximately similar to those of the analytical model neglecting the interactions of DMSHs on $r_\mathrm{rel}$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$ plane for all pairs and $r$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$ plane for colliding pairs. We compare our results with observed colliding dwarf galaxies and provide insight into the abundance of DMSHs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16332v1" target="_blank"><h2>Environmental Invariance of the Galaxy Size-Mass Relation <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Li-Wen Liao, Andrew Cooper<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 16 figures, accepted by A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), baryon cycle (abstract), feedback (abstract), LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The galaxy size-luminosity and size-stellar mass relations are important constraints on the galactic baryon cycle of gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. There are conflicting claims in the literature regarding how environment influences size: both direct transformative effects and `assembly bias' may contribute to observed variations with environment. We construct a large homogeneous sample of size measurements to M*~10^7 Msun. Our sample fills a gap in field galaxy size measurements around 10^7-10^8 Msun; the literature at these masses is biased towards satellites of L* galaxies and members of galaxy clusters. We use sizes from the DESI-LS, together with a published catalog that contains stellar masses and cluster positions derived from DESI-LS photometry. Our sample extends to z<0.3 and comprises 540,228 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and 9,513,732 galaxies with photometric redshifts. We explore the environmental dependence of size for a mass-limited subset of our sample at z<0.05, based on distance to the nearest cluster center. We obtain size-luminosity and size-mass relations in good agreement with previous studies. By separating galaxies according to color and morphology, we show that the environmental variation of the overall size-mass relation on Mpc scales can be understood as the consequence of a changing mixture of subpopulations, rather than direct size transformation. For example, at fixed mass, quiescent (red) late-type galaxies within 2Mpc of a cluster have the same size as quiescent late-type galaxies 30Mpc from the nearest cluster. Our results support individual galaxy assembly histories as the primary determinant of galaxy size. The existence of significantly different, environment-insensitive size mass relations for subpopulations separated by color and Sersic index provides a clear target for calibration of the baryon cycle in cosmological simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16291v1" target="_blank"><h2>Absorption effects in the expanding Universe: spectral transmittance functions of intergalactic medium for distant sources <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anguohao Yang, Bohdan Novosyadlyj, Pavlo Kopach, Bohdan Melekh, Gennadii Milinevsky<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> intergalactic medium (title, abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyse the formation of troughs in the continuous spectra of sources in redshift range $5-15$ for two reionization histories followed from the distant galaxy spectra and CMB anisotropy. We supposed that neutral hydrogen and helium atoms of homogeneous intergalactic medium are mainly in ground state and absorb the light of distant sources in the lines of Lyman series and continuums of HI, HeI and HeII. The frequency dependence of optical depths in the 40 lines of Lyman series of HI and HeII, and in 10 lines of HeI, as well as in their continuums were computed in order to estimate the spectral flux of radiation from halos virialized during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization epochs. Assuming the thermal continuous spectra with virialized temperature of halos with dwarf galaxy mass $\sim10^9$ M$_\odot$, we compute the spectral fluxes from such halos in the vicinity of our galaxy taking into account the cosmological distances, redshifts and absorptions by each absorber and all together. The obtained spectral transmittance functions of intergalactic medium, $S(λ;z)$, are analysed on the subject which absorber systems of HI, HeI and HeII are corresponding for formation of troughs in the continuous spectra of sources at redshift range $5-15$ and how it depends on reionization history. It is shown, that spectral features in the continuous spectra of sources in redshift range $5-7$ are very sensitive to the reionization histories of both elements, hydrogen and helium.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16256v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accelerating Reionization Constraints: An ANN-Emulator Framework for the SCRIPT Semi-numerical Model <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Saptarshi Sarkar, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 5 figures.

We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only $\approx 10^3$ high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy ($R^2 \approx 0.97$--$0.99$) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs. Compared to conventional MCMC, our pipeline reduces the number of expensive simulations by a factor of $\sim 100$ and lowers total CPU cost by up to a factor of $\sim 70$, while retaining statistical fidelity. This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16250v1" target="_blank"><h2>Temperature definitions and phase transitions within non-minimal large and small inflationary potentials <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jesus Anaya-Galeana, Orlando Luongo, Hernando Quevedo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 2 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore and compare two distinct temperature definitions for scalar field inflation in the context of small- and large-field potentials. The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $α$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $ζ\leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16244v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining interacting dark energy models with black hole superradiance <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhen-Hong Lyu, Rong-Gen Cai, Shao-Jiang Wang, Xiang-Xi Zeng<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 31 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The recent preference for a dynamical dark energy (DE) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument seems to call for interactions between DE and dark matter (DM), either from direct DM-DE interaction or indirect interaction induced by modified gravity. Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16206v1" target="_blank"><h2>A pilot VLBI study of the SQUAB quasar sample featuring multiple Gaia detections <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yingkang Zhang, Tao An, Xiang Ji, Zhenya Zheng, Yuanqi Liu, Qiqi Wu, Ruqiu Lin, Shilong Liao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 9 figures, accepted by A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), AGN (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Our previous work identified a class of SDSS quasars exhibiting multiple Gaia detections, classifying them as candidates for various astrophysical systems such as quasar-star pairs, dual quasars, and gravitationally lensed quasars. In this paper, we present a pilot VLBI study targeting a radio-bright subsample and report the first high-resolution imaging results. By leveraging the milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI and its precise astrometric coordination incorporating with Gaia, we aim to refine the classification of these multiple matched sources, search for potential dual AGNs, and assess the efficacy of the combined Gaia-VLBI approach in resolving ambiguous quasar systems. We cross-matched the SQUAB quasar sample with the FIRST and NVSS catalogs, identifying 18 radio-emitting sources. The three brightest were selected for dual-frequency (1.6 and 4.9 GHz) VLBA observations. We performed VLBI imaging at both Gaia positions, constructed spectral index maps, and estimated brightness temperatures to characterize the radio morphology and physical properties. For the three target sources, our VLBI observations reveal compact radio structures consistent with single AGN at the primary Gaia positions. No significant emission is detected at the secondary Gaia locations. These results support the interpretation of the sources as quasar$-$star pairs, in line with earlier studies. This pilot study demonstrates the value of radio-VLBI high-resolution follow-ups on Gaia-selected quasar systems with multiple counterparts, showing how they can unambiguously reveal the true nature of these systems and help remove contaminants from dual AGN candidate samples.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16159v1" target="_blank"><h2>Two Epochs of VLBI Observations of 8 KISSR Seyfert & LINER Galaxies: Suggestions of Fast and Filamentary Outflows <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Preeti Kharb, Anderson Caproni, Salmoli Ghosh, Daniel A.

These sources were chosen based on the presence of double peaks or asymmetries in their emission lines as observed in SDSS spectra. Parsec-scale radio emission is detected in 7 of the 8 sources in the second epoch. Jet-like features appear to persist over a $\sim4-9$ year timeline in these `radio-quiet' AGN. A few sources like KISSR1494, however, show significantly different structures after a 9 year interval. KISSR102, which was previously suggested to be a binary black hole candidate based on the presence of two compact cores, shows the tentative signatures of superluminal jet motion ($1.05\pm0.45$c). Tentative superluminal motion in a jet knot has been reported in another source, KISSR872 ($1.65\pm0.57$c). We present 1.5 GHz images from the VLA A-array of 4 sources. These images reveal core-lobe or core-halo structures. The alignment of the VLBI jet direction with the kpc-scale spectral index gradient, as well as the mismatch between the star formation rate derived from the radio and H$α$ line emission, support the suggestion that the kpc-scale emission is AGN-jet-related. The jets in KISSR sources appear to lose collimation over spatial scales between 200 parsec and 1 kpc. Overall, the characteristics of the KISSR jets are reminiscent of similar properties observed in VLBI monitoring studies of `radio-loud' AGN jets even as subtle differences related to the compactness and brightness of jet features remain.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16154v1" target="_blank"><h2>MAMMOTH-Grism: Revisiting the Mass-Metallicity Relation in Protocluster Environments at Cosmic Noon <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yiming Yang, Xin Wang, Xianlong He, Chao-Wei Tsai, Zheng Cai, Zihao Li, Matthew A.

We identify 63 protocluster member galaxies across three overdense structures at $z = 2\text{-}3$ with robust detections of [OIII], H$β$, and [OII] emission. The sample spans gas-phase metallicities of $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.2\text{-}8.6$, dust-corrected H$β$-based star formation rates (SFRs) of $10$-$250\,M_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, and stellar masses of $M_\ast \sim 10^{9.4}$-$10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, derived via spectral energy distribution fitting using deep HST and ground-based photometry. We stack spectra in five $M_\ast$ bins to obtain average metallicities and SFRs. Relative to field galaxies at similar redshifts, protocluster members show elevated SFRs at $M_\ast < 10^{10.25}\,M_\odot$ and a systematically shallower MZR: $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = (6.96 \pm 0.13) + (0.143 \pm 0.017) \times \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})$. We detect a mass-dependent environmental offset: massive protocluster galaxies are metal-poor compared to field counterparts of similar mass, whereas lower-mass systems exhibit comparable or mildly enhanced metallicities. This trend is consistent with a scenario where cold-mode accretion dilutes the interstellar medium (ISM) across the full mass range, while efficient recycling of feedback-driven outflows preferentially enriches the ISM in low-mass galaxies. Finally, we assess the dependence of metallicity offsets on local overdensity and find no significant trend, likely reflecting the survey's bias toward protocluster cores.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16130v1" target="_blank"><h2>Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Iolanda Navonea, Maria Giovanna Dainotti, Elisa Fazzari, Giovanni Montani, Naoto Maki<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient.

The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16119v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical evolution of bulges of active galactic nuclei in the early Universe: roles of accreting stars <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shuo Zhai, Jian-Min Wang, Yan-Rong Li, Wei-Jian Guo, Gang Zhao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 11 figures, 1 table.

We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z>15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16097v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forecasting the Constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ Modified Gravity in the CSST $3\times2$pt Photometric Survey <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jun-Hui Yan, Yan Gong, Qi Xiong, Xuelei Chen, Qi Guo, Ming Li, Yun Liu, Wenxiang Pei<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We forecast the constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model from the photometric survey operated by the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The simulated $3\times2$pt data of galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements within 100 deg$^{2}$ are used in the analysis. The mock observational maps are constructed from a light cone, redshift sampling and noise. The angular power spectra are measured with pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators and compared to theory in the same basis using validated weighting functions and an analytic covariance matrix that includes Gaussian, connected non-Gaussian, and super-sample terms. We model the theoretical spectra using two methods. The first one uses MGCAMB to compute the linear modified-gravity clustering power spectra, and the second one adopts the FREmu emulator with a baseline of nonlinear $Λ$CDM prescription. Parameter inference is performed with Cobaya, and the cosmological and modified-gravity parameters are sampled within the emulator training domain, which is jointly fitted with the systematic parameters. We find that the predictions from the two methods are in good agreement at the overlapping large scales, and the emulator method can correctly provide additional high-$\ell$ information. The $1σ$ upper bounds of $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$ are found to be $<-5.42$ for cosmic shear only case and $<-5.29$ for the 100 deg$^2$ CSST $3\times2$pt probe. The full CSST photometric survey with 17,500 deg$^2$ survey area is expected to further improve the constraint precision by about one order of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that the CSST $3\times2$pt survey can deliver strict tests on $f(R)$ gravity.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16082v1" target="_blank"><h2>Too Quiet for Comfort: Local Little Red Dots Lack Variability over Decades <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Colin J.

We use long-term photometric and spectroscopic observations of three local LRDs spanning $\sim 20$ years to measure variability in their rest-frame optical continuum and broad H$α$ emission lines. Using ZTF light curves over a rest-frame $\sim 5$ yr baseline, the $r$-band intrinsic rms variability is $(9\times 10^{-5})_{\rm -9E-5}^{+0.014}$ mag (J1022), $0.025\pm0.004$ mag (J1025) and $0.020\pm0.005$ mag (J1047), indicating low intrinsic variability ($<3-4\%$ at 3$σ$). These rms variability amplitudes are much lower than those for dwarf AGNs and more massive quasars. There is little structure in the optical variability structure functions for the three local LRDs, in contrast to normal AGN variability. Using available multi-epoch spectra, we constrain the broad H$α$ line flux variability to be less than a few percent, without significant profile changes, over a rest-frame baseline of $\sim 15$ yrs in J1025 and J1047, respectively. The three LRDs stand out in the Balmer line properties compared with normal broad-line AGNs, with exceptionally large H$α$ equivalent widths and H$α$/H$β$ ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. In the context of recent theoretical models of LRDs as dense gas-enshrouded massive black holes with super-Eddington accretion, our results suggest that the photosphere emission is long-term stable and the broad Balmer lines are primarily collisonally excited. This scenario is consistent with the lack of variability, large H$α$/H$β$ ratios and little dust extinction, as well as the expected high gas density. Virial black hole mass estimates using broad H$α$ assuming photoionization are therefore highly questionable for LRDs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16078v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large gas inflow driven by a matured galactic bar in the early Universe <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shuo Huang, Ryohei Kawabe, Hideki Umehata, Kotaro Kohno, Yoichi Tamura, Toshiki Saito<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted version before copy editing<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), dust (abstract), molecular gas (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Bar structures are present in about half of local disk galaxies and play pivotal roles in secular galaxy evolution. Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation to the rotating disk and transport gas inward to feed central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole. They are believed to be long-lived structures and are now identified at redshift $z>2$. Yet, little is known about the onset and effect of bars in the early cosmic epoch because spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here, we report a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observe the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and find the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funneling molecular gas into its center at a rate of $\approx600$ solar masses per year. Our results show that bar-driven dynamical processes and secular evolution were already at play 11.1 billion years ago, powering active star formation amid the gas-rich and far-infrared luminous growth phase in a massive disk galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16042v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PAU Survey: The $i$-band galaxy luminosity function from the present-day to $z = 2$ <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

PAUS combines broad-band imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey with narrow-band photometry from PAUCam, enabling high-precision photometric redshifts with an accuracy of $σ_{68} (Δz) = 0.019$ down to $i_{\textrm{AB}} = 23$. A synthetic lightcone mock catalogue built using the \texttt{GALFORM} semi-analytic model is used to simulate PAUS selection effects and photometric uncertainties, and to derive a machine-learning based estimate of the $k$-correction. We recover rest-frame $i$-band luminosities using a random forest regressor trained on simulated $ugriz$ photometry and redshifts. Luminosity functions are estimated using the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method, accounting for photometric redshift and magnitude errors, and validated against mock data. We find good agreement between observations and models at $z < 1$, with increasing discrepancies at higher redshifts due to photometric redshift outliers. The bright-end of the luminosity function becomes flatter at high redshift, primarily driven by redshift errors. We show that the faint-end of the luminosity function becomes more incomplete with increasing redshift, but is still useful for constraining models. We analyze the red and blue galaxy populations separately, observing distinct evolutionary trends. The model overpredicts the number of both faint red and blue galaxies. Our study highlights the importance of accurate redshift estimation and selection modeling for robust luminosity function recovery, and demonstrates that PAUS can characterise the galaxy population with photometric redshifts across a wide redshift baseline.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16032v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological Constraints on the Phenomenological Interacting Dark Energy Model with Fermi Gamma-Ray Bursts and DESI DR2 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ziyan Zhu, Qingquan Jiang, Yu Liu, Puxun Wu, Nan Liang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-20<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we constrain the phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) model using \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray burst (GRB) dataset and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2).

Following up on our initial detection of CRXH$_2$ emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH$_2$ rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH$_2$ and UV-pumped H$_2$ components, we isolate the para-H$_2$-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH$_2$ line intensity to the line-of-sight H$_2$ column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, $ζ_{\rm H_2}$, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of $N({\rm H}_2) = 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, we infer $ζ_{\rm H_2} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\approx 3$ higher than the average value derived from H$_3^+$ absorption studies. These results provide the most direct probe to date of cosmic-ray penetration into cold, dense gas, offering new constraints on both the microphysics of CR-H$_2$ interactions and the attenuation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds. Our findings establish CRXH$_2$ emission as a powerful new diagnostic of the cosmic-ray environment in interstellar space.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15869v1" target="_blank"><h2>CLASSY XIII.

However, because of the opacity of the intergalactic medium, it is often not possible to make direct measurements of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$) of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies. To explore the agreement and systematics of common indirect approaches, we applied six empirically calibrated diagnostics to predict $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$ for the 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). These methods- based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines, the UV continuum slope, Ly$α$ kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission line ratios- enable us to explore systematic differences between predictions and assess how galactic properties influence inferred LyC escape. Despite significant variations in method predictions, there is broad consistency in the resulting weak and strong LyC leaker classifications, with approximately half exhibiting predicted escape fractions $>$1%. We find evidence for two different pathways of LyC escape in nearby star-forming galaxies: (1) an early escape model driven by very young stellar populations, and (2) a delayed escape model that is consistent with supernova-driven outflows and time-dependent ISM clearing. The early escape model is favored among galaxies with a single, intense burst of recent star formation. In contrast, the delayed escape model is common among galaxies with more extended starburst histories. To interpret ionizing photon escape during the EoR, it will be necessary to recognize and understand this diversity in LyC escape mechanisms.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15851v1" target="_blank"><h2>DESI-Like Hubble Expansion From Staged Symmetry Breaking <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zachary J.

In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a renormalizable realization of that idea, which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $Λ$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves. Even if further study ultimately finds our fiducial model to be disfavored, this work is valuable for constraining the space of renormalizable, natural models that have the potential to realize the behavior desired by Chen and Loeb.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15828v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observational constraints on the product of dark energy chemical potential and number density in out-of-equilibrium models <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

We combine the bounds derived from the positivity of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics with observational constraints on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations of the equation of state (EoS) of the component. We use Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data from Pantheon+; baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2; and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements from Planck. For $α>0$ (particle creation), the thermodynamic restrictions yield only upper limits for the $μ_{0}n_{0}$ product, while in the case of $α<0$ (particle destruction) they establish both upper and lower limits, allowing for a range of values to be obtained. In both scenarios, however, we find that the chemical potential of dark energy must be negative, $μ<0$, which indicates a preference for the phantom regime. In particular, when $α<0$, it is noted that the thermodynamic bounds are simultaneously compatible only for very small absolute values of $α$, with $α=-0.0002$ being the limiting case and resulting in $μ_{0}n_{0}(α=-0.0002)=-2.2_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\,\,GeV/m^{3}$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15815v1" target="_blank"><h2>Streamlined Supergravity <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-th, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$.

For a range of primordial magnetic spectral indices, this effect produces distinctive modifications to the linear matter power spectrum. We find that current observations cannot yet constrain viable dark magnetic fields, as CMB tensor modes mostly provide more stringent constraints.

Fe abundances derived from Resolve, Xtend, and EPIC are broadly consistent, while RGS gives systematically lower values. Because the XRISM gate valve remained closed during these observations, Resolve spectral fitting is restricted to the 2--10 keV band, providing reliable constraints only for elements with strong lines in this band (S, Ar, Ca, Fe, Ni). Abundances of the $α$-elements are therefore derived using complementary observations from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra. We construct an average X/Fe pattern in the cluster core by using Resolve exclusively for S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe, and RGS + Xtend for O/Fe.

Comparison with the supernovae yield models indicates that the observed abundance pattern in A2029 core is best reproduced by a combination of core-collapsed yields from low-metallicity progenitors ($Z_{\rm init}=0.001$) and a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass, double-degenerate Type Ia model.

The ability of the smallest dark matter halos to form stars depends sensitively on the balance between gas cooling and reionization heating. To quantify how this balance shapes the abundance and properties of the faintest galaxies, we compare two model variants: a fiducial model that includes molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling and UV background radiation, and a No-H$_2$ model with atomic cooling only. Both models reproduce the structural properties of brighter Milky Way satellites, but they diverge at the lowest luminosities in the hyper-faint regime. The fiducial model predicts a substantially larger population of such systems that are on average hosted in halos with lower peak masses and quenched earlier. Many of these predicted systems lie below current observational thresholds but are within reach of next-generation deep imaging surveys. The predicted size-luminosity distributions of both models overlap with the region occupied by recently discovered "ambiguous" systems, whose classification as galaxies or star clusters remains uncertain. Specifically, we find that hyper-faint satellites have line-of-sight velocity dispersions of $σ_{\rm los} \sim 1-3$ km/s in the fiducial model, nearly an order of magnitude higher than expected for purely self-gravitating stellar systems of the same stellar mass. This distinction underscores the diagnostic power of precise kinematic measurements for determining whether ambiguous objects are dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies or star clusters, and highlights the importance of upcoming spectroscopic campaigns in resolving the nature of the faintest satellites.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15803v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Noisy Universe <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gabriela Barenboim, Aurora Ireland, Albert Stebbins<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 1 figure<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present observational constraints on large-scale white noise (LSWN) in the cosmic density field, a phenomenon predicted to arise from non-linear mode coupling during cosmological evolution. Building on the theoretical framework of Paper I, where we demonstrated that non-linearities inevitably redistribute power from small to large scales through mode mixing, we confront these predictions with current cosmological data. We modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to incorporate a white noise component $k_\mathrm{BH}/k$ in the primordial power spectrum and perform parameter estimation using current cosmological data. The non-detection of excess power on the largest observable scales places stringent upper bounds: $k_\mathrm{BH} \leq 1.80 \times 10^{-13}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 99\% confidence. These constraints imply the primordial power spectrum must deviate from perfect scale invariance on small scales, either through a cutoff at $k_{\mathrm{cut}} \lesssim 3~\mathrm{pc}^{-1}$ or through running of the spectral index with $α_s \lesssim -0.015$. Our results demonstrate that LSWN provides a powerful probe of the primordial spectrum at scales orders of magnitude smaller than directly observable, offering unique constraints on early-universe physics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15797v1" target="_blank"><h2>A scattering perspective on gravitational lensing <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mariana Carrillo Gonzalez, Valerio De Luca, Alice Garoffolo, Julio Parra-Martinez, Mark Trodden<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-th, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations.

The solver replaces standard neural activation functions with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and supports both soft -- via loss penalties -- and hard -- enforced by analytic masks -- implementations of Leaver's normalization. Benchmarking against Leaver's continued-fraction method shows cumulative (real+imaginary part) relative frequency errors of $\sim 0.001\%$ for the separated formulation with hard normalization, $\sim 0.1\%$ for both the soft separated and soft joint formulations, and $\sim 0.01\%$ for the hard joint case. Exploiting our ability to solve the joint equation, we add a small quadrupolar perturbation to the Teukolsky operator, effectively rendering the problem non-separable. The resulting perturbed quasinormal modes are compared against the expected precision of the Einstein Telescope, allowing us to constrain the magnitude of the perturbation. These proof-of-concept results demonstrate that hybrid spectral-PINN solvers can provide a flexible pathway to quasinormal spectra in settings where separability, asymptotics, or field content become more intricate and high accuracy is required.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15795v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey VI.

The observations are part of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and cover a 4 x 4 deg^2 field, corresponding to ~ Rvir. The 3$σ$ detection limit is log(MHI/Msun) = 5.7 for a 50 km/s-wide point source. We detect HI in 35 galaxies and 44 clouds with no optical counterparts. Using deep optical images from the Fornax Deep Survey, we show that the clouds are a distinct population, separated by a four magnitude gap from the faintest HI-detected galaxies. The majority (33 out of 44) of the clouds are associated with the two galaxies with the most HI in the cluster -- NGC 1365 and NGC 1427A, although the clouds contribute a negligible amount to the total MHI budget. By performing a SNR analysis and computing the Rauzy statistic on the HI detections, we demonstrate that our catalogue is complete down log(MHI/Msun) = 6, and we are therefore able to probe the HIMF down to this level. We find an abrupt drop of the number density of HI-detected galaxies at log(MHI/Msun) = 7, signifying a clear absence of galaxies between 6 < log(MHI/Msun) < 7. We use the modified maximum likelihood method to fit a Schechter function down to log(MHI/Msun) > 7, the range where the HIMF follows a power-law. The measured low-mass slope is $α$ = -1.31 $\pm$ 0.13, with a characteristic knee mass of log(M*/Msun) = 10.52 $\pm$ 1.89. The low-mass slope matches the slope in the field, while the knee is defined by a single galaxy and is unconstrained. Below log(MHI/Msun) = 7, there is a sharp departure from a Schechter function, and we report the first robust measurement of the collapse of a HIMF. For the HIMF below log(MHI/Msun) = 7 to follow a power-law, tens of galaxies are needed -- a factor ~ six higher than what is observed. The collapse of the Fornax HIMF is likely due to the rapid removal of HI from low-mass galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15793v1" target="_blank"><h2>How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess?

The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15790v1" target="_blank"><h2>How light can ALP dark matter be? <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kierthika Chathirathas, Thomas Schwetz<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 37 pages, 12 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We assume axion-like particles (ALPs) to provide the full dark matter abundance and derive various lower bounds on the ALP mass. We contrast the post- and pre-inflationary symmetry breaking cases and present allowed regions in the plane of ALP mass and energy scale of inflation. For the post-inflationary case, we revisit bounds from isocurvature perturbations taking into account that, as suggested by simulations, axion radiation by cosmic strings during the scaling regime provides the dominant production mechanism of dark matter, obtaining significantly weaker limits than previously. Combining isocurvature, with constraints from black hole superradiance and free streaming, we find that the bound $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-17}$ eV applies for most cases considered here. It can be potentially relaxed to $\sim 6\times 10^{-19}$ eV only in the post-inflationary case with a strongly temperature-dependent axion mass, subject to uncertainties on the axion emission spectrum. Significantly stronger bounds are obtained in the post-inflationary scenario from the non-observation of CMB tensor modes, which can be as strong as $m_a > 5\times 10^{-7}$ eV for small reheating efficiencies, $ε\lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15789v1" target="_blank"><h2>Do z>6 quasars reside in protoclusters? <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fabio Fontanot, Roberto Decarli, Gabriella De Lucia, Olga Cucciati, Lizhi Xie, Michaela Hirschmann<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 Pages, 7 Figures, Submitted to A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), galaxy evolution (abstract), high redshift (abstract), QSO (abstract), quasar (title, abstract), halo (abstract), haloes (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We discuss the properties of a sample of z>6 bright (bolometric luminosity L$_{\rm bolo}$>10$^{46.25}$ erg/s) Quasars drawn from a realization of the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model coupled with the Planck Millennium Simulation. We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z>6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 $h^{-1}$ cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L$_{\rm bolo}$>10$^{44}$ erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated. The large field-to-field variance in the the number of companions (both active and non-active) recently reported from JWST observations is fairly well reproduced by GAEA predictions. Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters. Viceversa, GAEA predicts that only a small fraction of Bright Central Galaxies have a bright z>6 QSOs among their progenitors. Our results suggest that luminous high-z QSO loosely trace the progenitors of low-z galaxy clusters, and that additional information about the environment of high-z QSOs are required to identify the most promising proto-cluster candidates.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15791v1" target="_blank"><h2>Electron densities from [S II] lines significantly overestimate the impact of ionised AGN outflows <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Luke R.

Observational tests of this scenario rely on determining outflow masses, which requires measuring the electron density ($n_e$) of ionised gas. However, recent studies have argued that the most commonly used diagnostic may underestimate electron densities (and hence overestimate outflow masses) by several orders of magnitude, casting doubt as to whether ionised AGN-driven outflows can provide the impact needed to reconcile observations with theory. Here, we investigate this by applying two different electron-density diagnostics to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy of the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample of 48 nearby type-2 quasars. Accounting for uncertainties, we find that outflow masses implied by the transauroral-line electron-density diagnostic are significantly lower than those produced by the commonly-used `strong-line' [S II](6717/6731) method, indicating a different origin of these emission lines and suggesting that these doubts are justified. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to modify the [S II](6717/6731) electron-density diagnostic for our sample by applying a correction of $\mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,\, outflow}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) = \mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,[S\,II]}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) + 0.75(\pm0.07)$ to account for this, which results in values that are statistically consistent with those produced using the transauroral-line method. The techniques that we present here will be crucial for outflow studies in the upcoming era of large spectroscopic surveys, which will also be able to verify our results and broaden this method to larger samples of AGN of different types.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15792v1" target="_blank"><h2>A first look at a complete view of spatially resolved star formation at 1<z<1.8 with JWST NGDEEP+FRESCO slitless spectroscopy <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jasleen Matharu, Lu Shen, Irene Shivaei, Pascal A.

We stack Pa$α$ and H$α$ emission-line maps, along with stellar continuum images at both wavelengths of 31 galaxies at 1<z<1.8 in three bins of stellar mass. Surface brightness profiles are measured and equivalent width (EW) profiles computed. Increasing Pa$α$ and H$α$ EW profiles with galactocentric radius across all stellar masses probed provide direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies both via dust-obscured and unobscured star formation for the first time. For galaxies on the main sequence, a weakly positive ($0.1\pm0.1$) Pa$α$/H$α$ line profile as a function of radius is found at $8.8\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<9.9$ with a negative ($-0.4\pm0.1$) Pa$α$/H$α$ line profile found at $9.9\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<11.0$. Low mass galaxies ($7.7\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<8.8$) with high sSFRs are found to have a negative ($-0.5\pm0.1$) Pa$α$/H$α$ line profile gradient.

However, traditional manual techniques are inadequate for processing the massive, heterogeneous datasets generated by modern radio surveys. In this study, we present a probabilistic machine learning framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction with Bayesian ensemble learning to achieve robust, scalable radio galaxy classification. The SVD approach effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving key morphological structures, enabling efficient representation of galaxy features. To mitigate class imbalance and avoid the introduction of artefacts, we incorporate a Local Neighbourhood Encoding strategy tailored to the astrophysical distribution of galaxy types. The resulting features are used to train and optimize several baseline classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons within bagging, boosting, and stacking ensembles governed by a Bayesian weighting scheme. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian ensembles outperform their traditional counterparts across all metrics, with the Bayesian stacking model achieving a classification accuracy of 99.0% and an F1-score of 0.99 across Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR-I), and Type II (FR-II) sources. Interpretability is enhanced through SHAP analysis, which highlights the principal components most associated with morphological distinctions. Beyond improving classification performance, our framework facilitates uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable integration into next-generation survey pipelines.

The physical reason for their large magnitude gap (dm12) may arise from early FG formation, which allowed all L galaxies to merge with the central one, and/or it could be related to the fact that galaxies accreting on the FGs move on radial orbits, shortening their merging timescales. The latter properties could be linked with the peculiar position of FGs within the cosmic web. We determine the velocity anisotropy profile beta(r) of the fossil cluster A267, which is related to the orbital distribution of cluster galaxies. This is the first individual FG for which the orbital distribution of galaxies is determined. We aim to confirm previous findings based on stack samples that indicate that FGs, on average, host galaxies on more radial orbits than normal clusters. We started with a sample of 2315 redshifts in the field of A267 and we determined the membership for 329 of them. Of these, 174 are located within r200. We used them as tracers of the gravitational potential of the cluster to solve the Jeans equation using the MAMPOSSt algorithm. We thus obtained the cluster mass M(r) and beta(r) profiles. We also estimated M(r) from the X-ray data. A comparison of the MAMPOSSt and X-ray-determined M(r)s allows us to estimate the cluster hydrostatic mass bias, that is consistent with previous findings. The anisotropy parameter beta(r) indicates tangential orbits for the galaxies near the cluster centre and increasingly radial orbits in the external regions. We therefore confirm that FGs are characterised by more radial orbits for their member galaxies than the average cluster population. We speculate that this different orbital distribution might be an important element in creating a large dm12.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15782v1" target="_blank"><h2>Trading oxygen for iron II.

Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived <[Fe/H]> from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15701v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Cross-correlation of kSZ and continuity equation velocity reconstruction with photometric DESI LRGs <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fiona McCarthy, Boryana Hadzhiyska, J.

We measure the cross-correlation of the kSZ-reconstructed velocity $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ with the velocity inferred from the continuity equation applied to the DESI LRGs $v^{\mathrm{cont}}$ at the $\sim 10 σ$ level, detecting the signal with an amplitude with respect to our theory of $b_v = 0.339\pm 0.034$. We fit a scale-dependent galaxy bias model to our measurement in order to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$, finding {$f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}=-180^{+61}_{-86}$} at 67\% confidence, with $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$ consistent with zero at 95\% confidence. We also measure an auto spectrum at $2.1σ$ significance which provides a constraint on $b_v$ of $b_v=0.26_{-0.05}^{+0.11}$, which is consistent with the measurement from the cross spectrum. Our combined measurement is $b_v=0.33\pm0.03$, an $11σ$ measurement. We find a good fit of our model to the data in all cases. Finally, we use different ACT frequency combinations to explore foreground contamination, finding no evidence for foreground contamination in our velocity cross correlation. We compare to a similar measurement where $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ is directly cross correlated with the large-scale galaxy field, and find signs of foreground contamination which is contained in the equal-redshift spectra.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15695v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Relationship Between Emission Line and Continuum Luminosity and the Baldwin Effect in Blazars.

This study investigates the relationship between the Mg II λ2798 Å emission line and the 3000 Å continuum luminosity, as well as the Baldwin Effect, in a sample of 40,685 radio-quiet (RQ) quasars and 441 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). Methods. We perform a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Mg II-3000 Å correlation, explicitly accounting for dispersion introduced by AGN variability. After excluding >3000 radio-loud sources, we employ a binning technique to mitigate variability effects, yielding a refined empirical relation. We also further examine the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, to investigate the dominant source of the continuum. Results. Our analysis reveals statistically significant differences in the slopes of the line-continuum luminosity relation between RQ quasars and FSRQs, with a parallel discrepancy in the Baldwin Effect. These findings imply either (1) intrinsic differences in the accretion disk spectra of RQ AGNs and FSRQs or (2) jet-induced continuum emission in FSRQs contributing to Broad Line Region (BLR) ionization. We also found that a substantial fraction of both RQ quasars (43.8\%) and blazars (55.5\%) exhibit NTD < 1. For blazars, this suggests that the accretion disk alone cannot fully explain BLR ionization; while we interpret NTD < 1 in radio-quiet quasars as a signature of several physical mechanisms: anomalies in the BLR structure (such as outflow or inflows), time lags between continuum and line variations, and the suppression of the UV continuum by a strong corona that diverts accretion power. Finally, we demonstrate that the Baldwin Effect emerges naturally from the line-continuum luminosity relationship, requiring no additional physical mechanism to explain its origin</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15646v1" target="_blank"><h2>Relativistic mean-field model with density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gabriel Frohaug, Konstantin Maslov, Veronica Dexheimer, Joaquin Grefa, Johannes Jahan, Claudia Ratti, Tulio E.

Motivated by microscopic calculations showing density- and isospin-asymmetry-dependence of self-energies, we implement a new form for the baryon-meson couplings. The parameters for the couplings are constrained by a Bayesian analysis, which anchors the model to nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($χ$EFT) predictions for pure neutron matter, heavy-ion collision data, and HALQCD-based hyperon potential calculations at 3-momentum $|\mathbf{k}|=0$ in both isospin-symmetric and pure neutron matter. The resulting EoS satisfies neutron star mass-radius constraints from NICER and GW170817, providing another way to address the hyperon puzzle. The low-density part of the EoS is described via nuclear statistical equilibrium with modern mass tables (AME20/FRDM12, 8244 nuclei), providing a novel and complete general-purpose EoS for astrophysical simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15627v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reporting a Deficit of Intrinsic NV Absorbers in Core-dominated, Radio-loud Quasars <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chris Culliton, Amber Roberts, Bryan DeMarcy, Sowgat Muzahid, Rajib Ganguly, Jane Charlton, Michael Eracleous, Toru Misawa<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 63 pages, 10 figures in main text, 2 appendices with 2 tables and 30 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We searched the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph archive for ultraviolet spectra of 428 AGN to identify intrinsic NV absorption systems. We filtered out Type 2 AGN, blazars, and spectra that do not cover at least part of the velocity window from 5000 km/s blueward to 5000 km/s redward (hereafter, the ``associated'' region) of the NV emission line. This yielded 175 Type 1 quasars, 34 radio-loud, 133 radio-quiet, and eight unconstrained. Our survey uncovered 77 associated NV systems in the spectra of 48 of these low-redshift quasars. We consider the incidence of intrinsic absorbers as a function of quasar properties (optical, radio and X-ray). We find a statistically significant dearth of intrinsic NV systems in the spectra of the 34 radio-loud quasars (6%), compared to 29% of the 133 radio-quiet quasars containing at least one intrinsic system. Assuming intrinsic systems are equally likely to occur in radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars and the orientations of the two subsamples are comparable, there is a 0.1% probability of such a deficit occurring by chance in the radio-loud population. We propose that this deficit of systems is caused by orientation effects. FIRST radio images are available for 14 of the 33 radio-loud quasars. These show that only three of the 14 radio-loud quasars have lobe-dominated morphologies, whereas 11 of the 14 radio-loud quasars have compact radio morphologies, implying that these quasars are face on, and suggesting that clouds that produce NV absorption are rarely found along the polar axis.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15601v1" target="_blank"><h2>Catching the 2021 γ-ray flare in the blazar TXS 2013+370 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Giorgos Michailidis, Efthalia Traianou, Nicola Marchili, Giorgos Filippos Paraschos, Thomas P.

In this work, we present full-polarization VLBI imaging at 22, 43, and 86 GHz together with contemporaneous single-dish monitoring (radio and $γ$-rays) to localize the high-energy dissipation site and probe the inner-jet structure and magnetic field topology. The images revealed a compact near-core knot at $r \simeq 40$-$60~μ\mathrm{as}$ contemporaneously with the GeV flare and a flat, core-dominated spectrum ($α\gtrsim -0.5$). The core has strong linear polarization and exhibits a $\sim 50^{\circ}$ EVPA rotation at 86 GHz; pixel-based and integrated fits yield a high, uniform rotation measure, ${\rm RM} = (7.8 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{4}~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, consistent with an external Faraday screen. Cross-correlation of Fermi-LAT and 15 GHz data shows a significant peak with the $γ$ rays leading by $Δt = (102 \pm 12)\,\mathrm{d}$; adopting $β_{\rm app} = 4.2 \pm 0.5$ and $θ= 4.1^{\circ} \pm 0.2^{\circ}$ implies a de-projected separation $Δr_{γ-15} = (2.71 \pm 0.47)\,\mathrm{pc}$ and locates the GeV emission between the jet apex and $\sim 0.42$ pc ($1σ$ range) downstream. Our results do not uniquely pinpoint the emission site; rather, they support two valid scenarios. The $γ$-ray production may occur within the BLR ($\sim 0.07$pc), where external-Compton scattering of optical/UV photons produces the $γ$ rays, or beyond the BLR, reaching $\sim 0.42$ pc ($1σ$) within the inner parsecs, where external-Compton scattering of dusty-torus infrared photons dominates. Both scenarios are compatible within the allowed range of emission distances, while opacity-driven core shifts modulate the observed radio-$γ$ delay without requiring large relocations of the dissipation zone.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15559v1" target="_blank"><h2>Excess of diffuse gamma-ray emission detected from the galaxy cluster Abell 119 from 14-year Fermi-LAT Data <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gajanan D Harale, Surajit Paul<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 9 figures, Published in Physical Review D, This is the accepted manuscript.

This non-detection may stem from limited sensitivity and source localization of current $γ$-ray instruments, as well as strong interactions of $γ$-rays with intervening material that restrict detectable signals to only a few nearby and dynamically active clusters. Motivated by these constraints, we selected a sample of nearby ($z<0.05$) merging clusters and analyzed 14 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. In this work, we present a detailed study of Abell 119 (A119), a merging cluster with significant X-ray luminosity and complex dynamics. Using \textit{Fermipy} and \textit{Fermi} Science Tools, we modeled all potential $γ$-ray sources and confirmed the 4FGL point sources 4FGL J0059.3$-$0152, 4FGL J0101.0$-$0059, and 4FGL J0059.2+0006 with significant TS values.s. It further reveals, a $\sim4σ$ excess of diffuse $γ$-ray emission offset by $\sim0.25^\circ$ from the cluster center, plausibly associated with the cluster halo. An extended model provides the best fit, yielding luminosity bounds of $\sim 12.21^{+2.74}_{-3.95}\times10^{42}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and a particle spectral index of $\sim2.25^{+0.38}_{-0.13}$, consistent with earlier expectations for cluster-scale non-thermal emission. These results suggest a hadronic origin for the detected signal. Although the $\sim4σ$ excess is compelling, uncertainties in localization and instrumental limitations prevent a definitive detection. Nonetheless, the results highlight the potential for deeper cluster studies, and the estimated neutrino flux $E^{2}φ_ν\approx3\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ motivates future observations with upcoming neutrino telescopes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15541v1" target="_blank"><h2>The VVVX quest for satellites around the Circinus galaxy <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> L.

Its environment is challenging to explore because it is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the Galactic disc. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo and determine the presence of dwarf satellites using near-infrared data. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV NIRGC within a 2-degree radius around Circinus, representing 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for all galaxies. Potential satellites were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the typical sizes of dwarf satellites, and combined with photometric redshifts. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to $K_{s}$ $\sim$ 15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of detections. At the distance of Circinus, this limiting magnitude corresponds to $K_{s}$ absolute magnitude of $-12.6$ mag, which allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, only 8 have photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to Circinus, which has a redshift of 0.0015. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range $0.001 < z_{phot} < 0.023$. The presence of dwarf satellites could not be confirmed with the available data in the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at low Galactic latitudes, providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15482v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the disk-jet coupling in M87 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ainara Saiz-Pérez, Christian M.

Recent GMVA observations of M 87 at event horizon scales revealed a ring-like structure which is 50% larger at 86 GHz than the ring observed by the Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz. Aims. In this paper, we study a possible origin of the increased ring size at 86 GHz. We specifically aim to study the role the nonthermal electron population plays in the observed event horizon scales. Methods. We carry out 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations. We incorporate into the latter synchrotron emission from both thermal and nonthermal electrons. To better compare our results to observations, we generate synthetic interferometric data adjusted to the properties of the observing arrays. We fit geometrical models to this data in Fourier space through Bayesian analysis to monitor the variable ring size and width over the simulated time span of years. Results. We find that the 86 GHz ring is always larger than the 230 GHz ring, which can be explained by the increased synchrotron self-absorption at 86 GHz and the mixed emission from both the accretion disk and the jet footpoints, as well as flux arcs ejected from a magnetized disk. We find agreement with the observations, particularly within the error range of the observational value of M/D for M 87. Conclusions. We show that state-of-the art 3D GRMHD simulations combined with thermal and nonthermal emitting particles can explain the observed frequency-dependent ring size in M 87. Importantly we found that MAD events triggered in the accretion disk can significantly increase the lower frequency ring sizes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15475v1" target="_blank"><h2>LCS: A Learnlet-Based Sparse Framework for Blind Source Separation <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> V.

Traditional BSS methods, such as those relying on fixed wavelet dictionaries, enforce sparsity during component separation, but may fall short when faced with the inherent complexity of real astrophysical signals. In this work, we introduce the Learnlet Component Separator (LCS), a novel BSS framework that bridges classical sparsity-based techniques with modern deep learning. LCS utilizes the Learnlet transform: a structured convolutional neural network designed to serve as a learned, wavelet-like multiscale representation. This hybrid design preserves the interpretability and sparsity, promoting properties of wavelets while gaining the adaptability and expressiveness of learned models. The LCS algorithm integrates this learned sparse representation into an iterative source separation process, enabling effective decomposition of multi-channel observations. While conceptually inspired by sparse BSS methods, LCS introduces a learned representation layer that significantly departs from classical fixed-basis assumptions. We evaluate LCS on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (average gain of about 5 dB on toy model examples). Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that combine signal processing priors with deep learning to address the challenges of next-generation cosmological experiments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15472v1" target="_blank"><h2>Challenging the $ω_0ω_a$CDM parametrization through rational expansions in view of DESI data release <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Youri Carloni, Orlando Luongo, Marek Biesiada<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In view of the new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2025 results, we analyze three types of \emph{Padé cosmology}, based on rational series making use of Padé approximants over the equations of state, namely Padé$^ω$ (0,1) and Padé$^ω$ (1,1), plus a Padé$^{q}$ (0,1), i.e., a rational expansion on the dark energy deceleration parameter, in which where the numerator and denominator orders are incorporated into the above brackets. These scenarios appear alternative dark energy parameterizations with respect to the well-known $ω_0ω_a$CDM model, claimed as the most viable model by DESI. Accordingly, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses with the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code, including the three Padé cosmology, along with the $ω_0ω_a$CDM and $Λ$CDM standard pictures. To this end, we combine independent probes from high to low redshifts to obtain reliable constraints on the cosmological parameters of these models and compare them using statistical selection criteria. \emph{Our results show that Padé cosmology is neither statistically excluded nor worse than the $ω_0ω_a$CDM parametrization}. On the contrary, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) identifies Padé$^{q}$ (0,1) as \emph{the best-fit model}, with weak evidence against the $ω_0ω_a$CDM parameterization, while the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) provides \emph{strong evidence against the $ω_0ω_a$CDM model, favoring Padé (1,1)}. Based on our bounds, we further investigate the evolution of the squared sound speed, revealing that the Padé$^{q}$ (0,1) and Padé$^ω$ (0,1) parameterizations exhibit enhanced stability compared with the other cases here considered and, therefore, describe robust alternatives for the cosmological background.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15470v1" target="_blank"><h2>Advancing Identification method of Gamma-Ray Bursts with Data and Feature Enhancement <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Peng Zhang, Bing Li, Ren-Zhou Gui, Shao-Lin Xiong, Yu Wang, Shi-Jie Zheng, Guang-Cheng Xiao, Xiao-Bo Li, Yue Huang, Chen-Wei Wang, Jia-Cong Liu, Yan-Qiu Zhang, Wang-Chen Xue, Chao Zheng, Yue Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under review.

In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which impacts the formation of the smallest halos. Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($ν$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $ν$DM interaction strengths down to $σ_{ν{\rm DM}}\sim 3\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out a recent claimed preference for a non-zero $ν$DM interaction in Lyman-$α$ data. Furthermore, we find that HERA will not be able to distinguish between $ν$DM and WDM. In the latter context, the threshold for detection of $ν$DM interactions translates into WDM with mass up to $m_{\rm WDM}\sim 9$ keV that could be detected by HERA.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15415v1" target="_blank"><h2>Elemental abundance ratios for the bulge of M31 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

We estimated abundances using full-spectrum fitting, full-index fitting, and line-strength analysis, in combination with different stellar population models. We first tested these techniques on mock spectra and SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs, and then applied them to high-quality long-slit spectroscopy of the M31 bulge obtained with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the GTC. We find that O, N, and Na are significantly enhanced relative to Fe across the bulge, with typical abundances >0.3~dex. In particular, N and Na show steep central enhancements, reaching ~0.5dex. C, Mg, and Si exhibit intermediate enhancements of [X/Fe]~0.2dex, with C and Mg decreasing toward the center to <~0.1dex; while Ca, and to a lesser extent Ti, closely follow Fe, with [X/Fe]<0.1dex. Applying the same analysis to SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs revealed that the abundance pattern of the M31 bulge closely resembles that of the most massive galaxies, except for N, which is significantly more enhanced (by ~0.1dex) in the bulge. For the bulk of the bulge, chemical evolution models assuming high star-formation efficiency and a short gas infall timescale reproduce the overall trends in [Fe/H] and [X/Fe]. In the central region (<~100pc), the high metallicity content of the bulge can be explained by either an IMF flatter than Salpeter at high mass, or a prolonged star formation. Additional processes, such as differential galactic winds, appear necessary to account for the observed decoupling among alpha elements and the strong central N enhancement. Our results support a scenario whereby the bulk of the M31 bulge formed during a fast and intense episode of star formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15400v1" target="_blank"><h2>Insights on Gas Distribution and Dynamics in Massive Proto-cluster G358.46$-$0.39: Possible Multiplicity in G358.46$-$0.39 MM1a <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chukwuebuka J.

G358.46$-$0.39 is previously known to consist of 4 dust continuum cores (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c and MM2). The integrated intensity map of C$^{17}$O reveals filamentary and dumbbell-shaped structures that are probably compressed gases from the expansion of the HII region MM2. The SiO emission reveals spatially overlapped blue and red outflow lobes, likely driven by an unresolved young stellar object (YSO) in MM1a. The spatial distribution of HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules in MM1a shows a compact morphology, with no detectable HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ emissions in the other cores. The SO$_{2}$ emission reveals a clear velocity gradient in MM1a, as well as large velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 3\,\kms) within the inner core of MM1a, which are consistent with rotating structures. We estimated the mass, momentum and energy outflow rate, as well as other outflow parameters. The SiO outflow exhibits a different morphology compared to the $^{12}$CO outflow morphology previously observed in MM1a. The SiO and $^{12}$CO outflows are probably associated with disks of separate cores with one face-on and the other edge-on, pointing to multiplicity of YSOs in MM1a. The properties of MM1a indicate that it is a massive protostar that is actively accreting and undergoing star formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15380v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simple relations from complex outflows: How the $M-σ$ relation emerges in a multi-phase environment <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Matas Tartėnas, Kastytis Zubovas, Eimantas Skuodas<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

This picture is motivated by analytical and semi-analytical models in which momentum-driven AGN winds can expel the gas once the SMBH reaches a critical mass. However, these models typically assume idealised conditions: smooth gas distributions, spherical symmetry, and very efficient cooling of the shocked AGN wind.
  We checked whether AGN outflows can establish the $M-σ$ relation in a multi-phase and turbulent galactic bulge subject to realistic radiative cooling while conserving the shocked AGN wind energy.
  We calculated a suite of purpose-built hydrodynamical simulations of AGN outflows in turbulent gas shells, covering a wide range of constant AGN luminosities. We tracked the outflow evolution over the course of $\geq1$~Myr. We analysed the effect of AGN outflow on the cold dense gas and SMBH feeding, estimating the luminosity threshold for removing most of the cold gas from the central regions.
  We find that AGNs with significantly sub-Eddington luminosities cannot suppress SMBH feeding, while luminosities exceeding $\sim 0.7$ times Eddington clear out both the diffuse hot gas and the cold clumps, consistent with the momentum-driven outflow formalism. We also show that dense gas clusters are affected almost exclusively by the AGN wind momentum, while the shocked wind energy escapes through low-density channels and inflates large bubbles of diffuse gas. Therefore, AGN wind-driven energy-conserving feedback in a turbulent multi-phase medium affects the dense gas only via the wind momentum. Thus, the momentum-driven outflow paradigm is applicable for explaining the $M-σ$ relation even in realistic systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15359v1" target="_blank"><h2>Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

We identify 97 CL quasars showing significant variability in high-ionization broad emission lines, including 45 turn-on and 52 turn-off events, corresponding to a detection rate of approximately 0.042%. This rate is lower than that found for low-ionization CL quasars, likely due to both selection effects and physical differences in high-ionization lines. Based on the CL quasar sample, we find that CL quasars generally exhibit lower accretion rates compared to typical quasars, with average Eddington ratios of log lambda_Edd approximately -1.14 in the bright state and approximately -1.39 in the dim state, compared to approximately -0.65 for typical quasars. While high-ionization lines in CL quasars follow the Baldwin effect on a population level, some individual sources show inverse Baldwin trends. We also find a positive correlation between the variability of high-ionization lines such as Mg II and C III] and the change in bolometric luminosity. In addition, we estimate a characteristic rest-frame timescale of approximately 3 years for CL transitions, with no significant difference between turn-on and turn-off cases.

Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15325v1" target="_blank"><h2>Origin of Galaxies <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nikolaos Samaras<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Successfully PhD defence in August 2025, Charles University, CZ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) has been particularly successful in predicting scaling relations for galactic systems, namely the baryonic Tully-Fisher for spirals, the Faber-Jackson for ellipticals and the Radial Acceleration Relation for late-type galaxies. Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called $ν$HDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the $ν$HDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the $ν$HDM model was proven capable of reproducing the $Λ$CDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history ($Ω_m \approx$ 0.3 and $H_0 \approx$ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the $ν$HDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-$ν$HDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by \textit{Planck}, except its fourth peak, but the opt-$ν$HDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with $Ω_m \approx$ 0.5 and $H_0 \approx$ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-$ν$HDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the $ν$HDM model, as well as in the opt-$ν$HDM model occurs quiet late, at $z\approx4$ and at $z\approx 5.5$, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the $ν$HDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15275v1" target="_blank"><h2>Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

(2025), we investigate the evolutionary sequence of broad emission lines using a redshift-selected subset (0.35 < z < 0.45) of 54 CL-AGNs whose Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectra simultaneously cover the Hα, H\b{eta}, and Mg II emission lines. To provide a baseline for comparison, we construct a control sample of 19,897 normal Type 1 AGNs within the same redshift range from the DESI Year 1 data. Through stacked spectral analysis and line-continuum luminosity correlations, we identify a clear evolutionary sequence in all AGN where broad H\b{eta} fades first, followed by Mg II, and then Hα, as the AGN luminosity declines - consistent with expectations from reverberation mapping. This trend reflects a radially stratified broad line region (BLR), where each line's responsivity depends on its ionization potential and radial distance from the central engine. In addition, we find that more massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) require lower Eddington ratios to fully suppress broad emission lines, suggesting that the critical accretion threshold for the CL phenomenon is mass-dependent. Our results present the first statistical confirmation of a stratified broad line fading sequence in AGNs, reinforcing the central role of accretion state in shaping BLR structure and visibility.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15215v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of action-space coherence in a Milky Way-like simulation <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Arunima Arunima, Mark R.

While this holds in a static, axisymmetric potential, it is unknown how strongly the time-varying, non-axisymmetric structure of a real galactic disk drives action drift that inhibits cluster reconstruction. We answer this question using a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like spiral disc galaxy. We show that, while stars experience significant action evolution over $\lesssim 100$ Myr, they do so in a correlated fashion whereby stars born in close proximity maintain very similar actions for up to 0.5 Gyr. The degree of coherence shows no significant dependence on galactocentric radius, but varies between action components: vertical actions decohere for stars born more than a few hundred parsecs apart (likely due to giant molecular clouds), while radial and azimuthal actions remain correlated on kiloparsec scales (likely influenced by spiral arms). We use our measurements of the rate of action decoherence to develop a probabilistic framework that lets us infer the initial sizes of the star cluster progenitors of present-day stellar streams from their measured action distributions, which we apply to 438 known moving groups. Our results suggest that most of these streams likely originated from compact clusters, but that a significant minority are instead likely to be resonant or dynamically induced structures. This method of classifying streams complements existing methods, optimises the use of expensive spectroscopic abundance measurements, and will be enhanced by the more precise kinematic data that will soon become available from \textit{Gaia} DR4.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15193v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational Wave Phase shifts of black hole mergers in AGN Disks <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hiromichi Tagawa, Connar Rowan, János Takátsy, Lorenz Zwick, Kai Hendriks, Wen-Biao Han, Johan Samsing<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 8 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have discovered about 200 compact object mergers. The astrophysical origins of these events are highly debated, and it is possible that at least a fraction of them originate from dynamical environments. Among these, the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are particularly interesting as promising environments, as some observed properties may be more readily produced there. When compact objects merge in these environments, acceleration from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) or nearby companions is inevitable. Such acceleration induces a phase shift in the observed GW waveforms, which can serve as a useful tool to distinguish the underlying merging environments for each GW event. In this paper, we investigate the expected distribution of such acceleration-induced GW phase shifts, using a semi-analytical model combined with a one-dimensional AGN population synthesis code. We find significant contributions from three-body interactions involving a nearby third object. Our results indicate that the GW phase shift is likely to be larger compared to other channels, making it distinguishable by future GW facilities such as TianQin, DECIGO, Taiji, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. Interestingly, a notable fraction of mergers in fact exhibit a significant GW phase shift ($\gtrsim~{\rm 1\ rad}$) at frequencies above $10~{\rm Hz}$, which could even be detectable by current GW detectors such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Additionally, if gas-hardening during three-body interactions is taken into account, the GW frequency can be boosted to $\gtrsim 10~{\rm Hz}$, potentially further aiding in the detection of the phase shift.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15154v1" target="_blank"><h2>Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission as the Driving Mechanism in Long-Period Radio Transients <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lilia Ferrario<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Long-period radio transients (LPRTs) are highly polarised, coherent radio sources with periods of minutes to hours and bursts typically lasting 10-100s.

In this picture, a rotating oblique magnetosphere beams radiation into a thin, hollow emission cone whose surface lies almost perpendicularly to the local magnetic field. The observed very narrow pulses arise when the line of sight skims the cone. Broader profiles and weak leading or trailing components occur when multiple azimuths along the emission ring satisfy the maser resonance condition. The observed isotropic-equivalent luminosities of ~10^{30}-10^{31} erg s^{-1} correspond to modest intrinsic powers once strong ECME beaming is taken into account, which is readily achievable through accretion from the interstellar medium.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15134v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measuring the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale for 105 UTMOST pulsars with a Kalman filter <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Wenhao Dong, Andrew Melatos, Nicholas J.

Here, we present new timing-noise-based estimates of the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale \(τ\) for 105 radio pulsars in the UTMOST dataset, by Kalman filtering the pulse times of arrival. The 105 objects are selected because they favor a two-component, crust-superfluid model over a one-component model with log Bayes factor \(\ln \mathfrak{B}_{\rm BF} \geq 5\). The median estimate of \(τ\) ranges from \(10^{4.6\pm0.4}\)\,s for PSR J2241$-$5236 to \(10^{7.7^{+0.7}_{-0.4}}\)\,s for PSR J1644$-$4559 among 28 out of 105 objects with sharply peaked \(τ\) posteriors. A hierarchical Bayesian analysis is performed on 101 out of 105 objects that are canonical (i.e.\ neither recycled nor magnetars) and reside in the populous core of the \(Ω_{\rm c}\)-\(\dotΩ_{\rm c}\) plane. It returns the population-level scaling \(τ\propto Ω_{\rm c}^{0.19^{+0.50}_{-0.52}} |\dotΩ_{\rm c}|^{0.18^{+0.18}_{-0.19}}\), where \(Ω_{\rm c}\) and \(\dotΩ_{\rm c}\) are the angular velocity and spin-down rate of the crust respectively.

Using two-band observational data from the 3mm ATOMS and 1.3mm QUARKS surveys, we report a high-mass prestellar core candidate, C2, located on the side of the bright-rimmed cloud IRAS 18290-0924. The C2 core identified from the 3mm continuum data of the ATOMS survey ($\sim$2 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 10000~au$ at 5.3 kpc) has a mass ranging from 27-68 $M_{\odot}$ for temperatures 10-22K within a radius of $\sim$2800 au. The highest-resolution ($\sim$0.3 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 1500 au$) observations of this source presented to date from the QUARKS survey reveal no evidence of further fragmentation. Further analysis of a total $\sim$10 GHz band width of molecular line survey does not find star-formation activity (e.g., outflows, ionized gas) associated with the core, with a few molecular lines of cold gas detected only. Additionally, virial analysis indicates the C2 core is gravitationally bound ($α_{\rm vir} \sim0.1-0.3$) and thus could be undergoing collapse toward star formation. These results strongly establish a candidate for a high-mass prestellar core, contributing to the very limited number of such sources known to date.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15056v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hyperaccretion-driven relativistic jets from massive collapsars in active galactic nucleus disks <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yun-Feng Wei, Tong Liu, Bao-Quan Huang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The observable characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mainly determined by the jet propagation within the disk. In the massive collapsar scenario, we consider that the mass and metallicity of progenitor stars can significantly affect the jet durations and luminosities, which in turn influence whether the jet can break out from AGN disks. For the cases with low metallicity, massive stars tend to keep their massive envelopes. Thus the hyperaccretion of these envelopes onto the newborn black holes (BHs) can prolong the activity duration of the central engine, thereby allowing the jets to potentially break out from the disks. For successful jets, we further study their prompt emission and afterglows for different supermassive BHs and locations and discuss the detectability of these signals by instruments such as \emph{Swift} and Einstein Probe. Future related observations will help constrain the structure, components, and evolutionary history of AGN disks and the massive stars embedded within them.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15006v1" target="_blank"><h2>Toward Complete Merger Identification at Cosmic Noon with Deep Learning <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Aimee Schechter, Aleksandra Ciprijanovic, Rebecca Nevin, Julie Comerford, Xuejian Shen, Aaron Stemo, Laura Blecha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences Workshop<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-19<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> As we enter the era of large imaging surveys such as $\textit{Roman}$, Rubin, and $\textit{Euclid}$, a deeper understanding of potential biases and selection effects in optical astronomical catalogs created with the use of ML-based methods is paramount.

Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14941v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the Jet Energetics of the Transient X-ray Binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 through Calorimetry <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pau Bosch-Cabot, Alexandra J.

Such flow generates magnetic disturbances and produces a drag force on the sphere, and we explore the corresponding drag coefficient as a function of the flow speed relative to Alfvén speed and the $β$ parameter of the background plasma. We find that the drag is generally well-described by the Alfvén wing model, but we also show that slow magnetosonic waves provide a correction through their own wing-like features.

At the upper end of their distribution is SN\,2023taz, one of the most luminous SLSNe discovered to date with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{g,\rm{peak}}=-22.75 \pm 0.03$ and a lower limit for energy radiated of $E=2.9 \times 10^{51}$\,erg. Magnetar model fits reveal individual parameter values typical of the SLSN population, but the combination of a low $B$-field and ejecta mass with a short spin period places SN\,2023taz in a unusual region of parameter space, accounting for its extreme luminosity. The optical data around peak are consistent with a temperature of $\sim$17\,000\,K but SN\,2023taz shows a surprising deficit in the UV compared to other events in this temperature range. We find no indication of dust extinction that could plausibly explain the UV deficit. The lower level of UV flux is reminiscent of the absorption seen in lower-luminosity events like SN\,2017dwh, where Fe-group elements are responsible for the effect. However, in the case of SN\,2023taz, there is no evidence for a larger amount of Fe-group elements which could contribute to line blanketing. Comparing to SLSNe with well-observed UV spectra, an underlying temperature of $8000-9000$\,K would match the UV spectral slope, but is not consistent with the optical colour temperatures of these events. The most likely explanation is enhanced absorption by intermediate-mass elements, challenging previous findings that SLSNe exhibit similar UV absorption line equivalent widths. This highlights the need for expanded UV spectroscopic coverage of SLSNe, especially at early times, to build a framework for interpreting their diversity and to enable classification at higher redshifts where optical observations will exclusively probe rest-frame UV emission.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14912v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamics in the Cores of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos: Reduced Stalling and Accelerated Core Collapse <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Frank C. van den Bosch, Shashank Dattathri<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 15 figures, submitted for publication in The Open Journal of Astrophysics<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is an intriguing alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, which predicts that dark matter halos typically have large, isothermal cores. Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM. We discuss implications of our finding for constraining the nature of dark matter by using observations of massive objects such as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), globular clusters, and nuclear star clusters in the central regions of galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14864v1" target="_blank"><h2>Improved cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marcin Badziak, Adam Gomułka, Maxim Laletin, Krzysztof Szafrański<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present updated cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions based on state-of-the-art computations of the thermal axion abundance. By combining Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2, we derive improved limits on both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion couplings. Incorporating finite axion mass effects substantially strengthens the bounds for axion masses above 0.1 eV compared to those inferred from the $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ constraint alone. The bounds on the LFC axion-tau coupling and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are improved by several orders of magnitude and the lower bound on the axion decay constant may exceed $10^6$ and $10^8$ GeV, respectively, for axion masses above 1 eV. Our cosmological constraints on LFC axion couplings to muons and taus and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are stronger than all other constraints for masses above 0.3 eV. In particular, they are stronger than recent collider constraints from Belle-II on $τ\rightarrow la$ decays, where $l=e$ or $μ$. The collider constraints on $μ\rightarrow ea$ decays are weaker than the cosmological constraints for axion masses above 100 eV.

Several recent works have found evidence that the accretion flow in the galactic nuclei of QPEs is of recent origin, and that it is unlike canonical active galactic nuclei (AGN). A precursor tidal disruption event has been observed in a few cases. In this work we report new radio observations of the QPE host galaxy RXJ\,1301.9+2747 taken at 5.0\,GHz with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA), to complement archival 1.7\,GHz observations reported previously. Our new observations confirm the presence of a highly compact radio source in RXJ\,1301.9+2747, which is smaller than $0.9\times0.4~\mathrm{pc}$ at 5.0\,GHz. The nonsimultaneous very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) compact flux of the source is consistent with a negative spectral index, and thus is similar to the larger non-VLBI scale radio spectral index. Contrary to earlier results at 1.7\,GHz, we find the 5\,GHz emission offset from the optical Gaia position, which may be due to dust extinction in the host galaxy. In addition, there is a significant offset between the 1.7 and 5.0\,GHz data, which may result from astrophysical uncertainties in the calibration source. This sheds new light on the elusive properties of the radio-detected QPE sources. Consistent with previous results, our observations disfavor a star formation or jet-core-region origin of the radio emission. We cannot rule out a reconnection-driven scenario for the radio emission, but we favor a remnant jet or outflow scenario. This is overall in agreement with the radio properties of radio-detected QPE sources at lower angular resolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14858v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large Language Model Driven Analysis of General Coordinates Network (GCN) Circulars <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vidushi Sharma, Ronit Agarwala, Judith L.

GCN distributes two data products - automated ``Notices,'' and human-generated ``Circulars,'' that report the observations of high-energy and multi-messenger astronomical transients. The flexible and non-structured format of GCN Circulars, comprising of more than 40500 Circulars accumulated over three decades, makes it challenging to manually extract observational information, such as redshift or observed wavebands. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the automated parsing of transient reports. We develop a neural topic modeling pipeline with open-source tools for the automatic clustering and summarization of astrophysical topics in the Circulars database. Using neural topic modeling and contrastive fine-tuning, we classify Circulars based on their observation wavebands and messengers. Additionally, we separate gravitational wave (GW) event clusters and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from the Circulars database. Finally, using the open-source Mistral model, we implement a system to automatically extract gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshift information from the Circulars archive, without the need for any training. Evaluation against the manually curated Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRB table shows that our simple system, with the help of prompt-tuning, output parsing, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), can achieve an accuracy of 97.2 % for redshift-containing Circulars. Our neural search enhanced RAG pipeline accurately retrieved 96.8 % of redshift circulars from the manually curated database. Our study demonstrates the potential of LLMs, to automate and enhance astronomical text mining, and provides a foundation work for future advances in transient alert analysis.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14856v1" target="_blank"><h2>Photometric Constraints on Intermediate-mass Black Holes in the Galactic Centre <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tamojeet Roychowdhury, Sebastiano D. von Fellenberg, Joseph M.

The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared ($\sim$ 5-25 $μ$m), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are $\lesssim$1 mJy at 12 $μ$m and $\lesssim$2 mJy at 19 $μ$m. These translate to luminosities $\lesssim 25 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass $\gtrsim 10^3$ M$_\odot$ accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6" $\times$ 6" region that is more massive than $\approx$ 2 $\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$ and accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^3$ M$_\odot$. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14850v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mid-infrared extinction toward the Galactic center <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sebastiano D. von Fellenberg, Joseph M.

To measure the MIR extinction, we employ two approaches: modeling the intrinsic-to-observed dust thermal spectrum and assessing the differential extinction between hydrogen recombination lines. Expanding on prior work, we directly model the dust-opacity distribution along the line of sight, and we make available a Python code that provides a flexible tool for deriving intrinsic dust emission spectra. We confirm the spatial variability of extinction across the field, demonstrating that dusty sources--such as IRS~29N--exhibit higher local extinction. Furthermore, we verify the absence of PAH emission features in the Galactic center MIR spectra.

This transformation is identifiable by observing galaxy colors and can be seen in the morphological transformation of late-type galaxies into early-type galaxies, which creates the morphology-density relation seen when comparing populations in clusters to co-eval field galaxies. However, high-z (z > 2) galaxy morphology studies are hindered by the high angular resolution necessary to characterize morphology. We present a study of HST WFC3 F160W observations of protoclusters from the MAMMOTH survey (BOSS1244 and BOSS1542) at z ~ 2.23 with populations of previously identified HAEs. By measuring the Sersic index of 151 HAEs, we look for the early morphological transformation of star-forming galaxies in these well-studied, large, non-virialized protoclusters, which we believe are precursors of present-day clusters. We find the morphology of the populations of star-forming protocluster galaxies does not differ from the co-eval field. However, we identify a population of clumpy, potentially merging galaxies, which could lead to an increase in the population of early-type galaxies in these structures. Additionally, in BOSS1244, which has two previously identified massive quiescent galaxies including a BCG, we find an abundance of early-type galaxies near both the BCG and two co-eval high-z quasars. Although we find a strong similarity between the morphology of field and protocluster galaxies, the population of early-type star-forming galaxies surrounding the spectroscopically confirmed quiescent BCG in BOSS1244, something not seen in BOSS1542, may point to differences in the evolutionary state of these co-eval protoclusters and be a sign of an early forming cluster core in BOSS1244.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14842v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variability-selected AGN in dwarf galaxies: the incidence of AGN in dwarf and massive galaxies is similar <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

Dwarf AGN hosts do not show strong differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies compared to the controls, which indicates that AGN triggering, at least in this sample, is not strongly correlated with environment.

Our results suggest that the incidence of AGN in dwarfs and massive galaxies is similar (within less than a factor of 2 of each other), with some evidence that the AGN fraction increases with stellar mass in the dwarf population.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14836v1" target="_blank"><h2>First Mid-infrared Detection and Modeling of a Flare from Sgr A*.

D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index $α_{\rm{MIR}}=0.45\pm0.01_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.08_{\rm{sys}}$ during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states ($α_{\rm{NIR}}\approx0.5$). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of $Δα_{\rm{MIR}}=0.33\pm0.06_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.11_{\rm{sys}}$ at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q--U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14834v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mixing between AGN winds and ISM clouds produces luminous X-ray emission <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Samuel Ruthven Ward, Tiago Costa, Chris M.

The hot, shocked phase of these outflows ($T \gtrsim 10^{6} \rm{\ K}$) is expected to dominate the energy content, but is challenging to observe due to its long cooling time and low emissivity. The cool phase ($T \lesssim 10^{4} \rm{\ K}$) is easier to detect observationally, but it traces a less energetic outflow component. In prior simulations of the interaction between an energy-driven AGN outflow and a clumpy ISM, we found that mixing between hot wind and cool ISM clouds produces a new, highly radiative, phase at $T \approx 10^{6-7} \rm{\ K}$ which fuels the formation of a long-lived ($\geq 5\ \rm{Myr}$) cool outflow. We investigate the X-ray emission generated by thermal Bremsstrahlung and high-ionisation metal line emission in this mixing phase, finding that it could contribute significantly to the X-ray output of the outflow. This mixing-induced X-ray emission is strongest in the part of the outflow propagating equatorially through the disc, and is extended on scales of $D\simeq 3-4\ \rm{kpc}$. For quasar luminosities of $L_{\rm{AGN}}\simeq 10^{45-46}\rm{\ erg\ s^{-1}}$, the resulting X-ray luminosity is equivalent to that expected from star formation rates $\rm{SFR}\simeq 10-200\ \rm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$, showing that it could be an important source of soft X-rays in AGN host galaxies. Our results suggest that this extended emission could be resolvable in local quasars ($z\lesssim 0.11$) using high spatial-resolution X-ray observatories such as Chandra, or proposed missions such as AXIS and Lynx.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14833v1" target="_blank"><h2>Localized Deviations from the CO-PAH Relation in PHANGS-JWST Galaxies: Faint PAH Emission or Elevated CO Emissivity? <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jaeyeon Kim, Adam K.

Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7$μ$m PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are mostly located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3$μ$m and 11.3$μ$m) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10$μ$m and 21$μ$m), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7$μ$m PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH size distributions and spectral energy distribution of the illuminating radiation differ slightly compared to nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions generally show higher CO velocity dispersions ($Δv_{\mathrm{CO}}$). This increase in $Δv_{\mathrm{CO}}$ may lower CO optical depth and raise its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14739v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forecasting properties of detectable massive binary black hole mergers in the era of space based gravitational-wave detectors <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sourabh Magare, Abhinav Roy, Shasvath J.

In this work, we analyze MBH mergers, their GW signals and detectability, as well as their population properties, using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation - NINJA Simulation Suite. We discuss the effect of resolution and finite volume on the black hole mass function (BHMF), which in turn limits the mergers associated with low mass black holes, $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_\odot$. We find the upper limit on the total mass of the MBH binaries detectable by LISA to be $\sim 10^{8.4} M_\odot$. We also find that adding time delays pertaining to dissipative processes like dynamical friction and stellar hardening during the final stages of the inspiral for which the simulation lacks sufficient resolution to model, considerably shifts the peak of redshift distribution of detectable binaries from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.1$. Time delays reduce the number of detectable GW events but on the other hand their signal-to-noise is increased. From the observational point of view, we find a strong correlation between the SFR and $L_{\rm bol}$ at high redshifts for the detectable LISA binaries. This may prove to be a future application in the coincident observation of MBH binaries by GW and electromagnetic observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14726v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the Nature of Dark Matter from Tidal Radii of Cluster Galaxy Subhalos <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Barry T.

Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range <$z_\text{spec}$>$ \simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M_{200} \simeq0.41$-$2.2\times 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM. Our results indicate that the outer spatial extents of subhalos are statistically consistent with CDM, corroborated by redshift- and mass-matched analogs from the Illustris-TNG simulations. We conclude that the tidal radii of cluster galaxy subhalos serve as an important and complementary diagnostic of the nature of dark matter in these violent, dense environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14697v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transferring Data from a Voronoi Mesh to an Adaptive Cartesian Grid in Pursuit of Self-consistent Top-down Star Formation <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sean C.

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be a powerful tool for simulating the details of star cluster formation and gas dispersal by stellar feedback. Zooming in from galactic to local scales using the star cluster formation simulation package Torch requires transferring simulation data from one scale to the other. Therefore, we introduce VorAMR, a novel computational tool that interpolates data from an unstructured Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. VorAMR is integrated into the Torch package, which integrates the FLASH AMR magnetohydrodynamics code into the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment. VorAMR interpolates data from an AREPO simulation to a FLASH AMR grid using a nearest-neighbor particle scheme, which can then be evolved within the Torch package, representing the first ever transfer of data from a Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. Interpolation from one numerical representation to another results in an error of a few percent in global mass and energy conservation, which could be reduced with higher-order interpolation of the Voronoi cells. We show that the postinterpolation Torch simulation evolves without numerical abnormalities. A preliminary Torch simulation is evolved for 3.22 Myr and compared to the original AREPO simulation over the same time period. We observe similarly distributed star cluster formation between the two simulations. More compact clusters are produced in the Torch simulation as well as 2.3 times as much stellar material as in AREPO, likely due to the differences in resolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14677v1" target="_blank"><h2>Equilateral non-Gaussian Bias at the Field Level <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Divij Sharma, James M.

Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b_ψ$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b_ψ$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b_ψ$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level. We present a fitting formula for $b_ψ$ as a function of the linear bias, which can be used to set priors in PNG searches with ongoing and future galaxy surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14673v1" target="_blank"><h2>Closing in on $α$-attractors <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Laura Iacconi, Sukannya Bhattacharya, Matteo Fasiello, David Wands<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $α$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $α$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\bar w>1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $α$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $α\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincaré models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\bar{w}\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14667v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-resolution weak lensing mass mapping from DES-Y3 data using diffusion-based prior <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Supranta S.

Our analysis reveals a high electron temperature ($T_e$$\sim$30000K) in the ionized gas, independent of the ionization level. We measure a wide range in the electron densities derived from [OIII]$λ$5008/[OIII]88$μ$m and [ArIV]$λ$4713/[ArIV]$λ$4742 ratios (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])$\sim$2.7-3.8), and previous values (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])>4.8) based on high-ionization rest-UV emission lines. The ionized gas appears to be clumpy with a low filling factor ranging from about 10% to 0.2% for the low- and high-density clouds. In addition, we observe a very complex ISM kinematic structure, with the presence of two distinct broad and a very-broad components (FWHM$\sim$210 and $\sim$1000 kms$^{-1}$) in addition to the systemic one (FWHM$\sim$60 kms$^{-1}$) in [OIII]$λ$5008 and H$α$. These broad components are heavily extinct (A$_V$$\sim$1.5 and 2.5, respectively), based on their Balmer decrements, while the gas associated to the narrow component is consistent with no extinction. The maximal velocities of these outflows ($\sim$115-500kms$^{-1}$) are such that a fraction of the total outflowing gas (0.16-2.1$\times$10$^7$M$_\odot$) could escape into the IGM. The rest of the gas will fall back to the central regions, being available for additional star formation episodes. The presence of dusty outflows and clumpy (i.e., low filling factor) ISM give support to the Attenuation-Free scenario proposed to explain the high-z UV-bright compact galaxies such as RXCJ2248-ID. On the other hand, the high densities in the ISM, together with the high SFR surface brightness, and the amount of returning outflowing mass give support to the Feedback-Free Starburst scenario.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14578v1" target="_blank"><h2>Point-symmetric morphology in supernova remnant G11.2-0.3: the jittering jets explosion mechanism <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Noam Soker<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> It will be submitted in two days to allow for comments (including missing references)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> I identify a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant SNR G11.2-0.3 composed of three pairs of opposite morphological features, and attribute their shaping to three energetic pairs of jets during the explosion process in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The pairs of morphological features are two opposite rings, a strip of dense ejecta extending on both sides of the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925, and an ear-nozzle opposite structure. According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets.

We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$β$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$β$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\log_{10} M_\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14538v1" target="_blank"><h2>A comparison of time-dependent Cloudy astrophysical code simulations with experimental X-ray spectra from keV laser-generated argon plasmas <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> N.

The principle of the experiment is that use of line emission rather than the usual sub-keV quasi-blackbody source allows keV radiation to play a more dominant role compared to softer X-rays and thus mimic the effect of a blackbody with a higher effective spectral temperature. Our aim is to reproduce in the laboratory the extreme photoionization conditions found in accretion-powered astrophysical sources. In this paper, we compare the experimental results on K-$β$ X-ray Ar spectra with modelling using the time-dependent version of the Cloudy astrophysical code. The results indicate that photoionized laboratory plasmas can be successfully modelled with codes such as Cloudy that have been developed for application to astrophysical sources. Our comparison of simulation and experiment shows that the flux of sub-keV photons that photoionize the outer-shell electrons can have a significant effect, and that detailed measurements of the X-ray drive spectrum across all photon energy ranges are crucial for accurate modelling of experiments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14483v1" target="_blank"><h2>VENUS: A Strongly Lensed Clumpy Galaxy at $z\sim11-12$ behind the Galaxy Cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Minami Nakane, Vasily Kokorev, Seiji Fujimoto, Masami Ouchi, Derek J.

The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at $z=0.505$, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 ($μ\sim 20-30$), are very bright (F200W$\sim26$ AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Ly$α$ breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-$L^*$ galaxy ($M_{\rm UV}\sim-18.0$ mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has effective radius of $r_\mathrm{eff}\sim 10-70$ pc and stellar mass of $\sim10^7\ M_\odot$. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons ($\gtrsim80\%$), similar to other high-$z$ clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxy. The Misty Moons, a lensed galaxy with resolved internal structures, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring the early stages of galaxy formation at $z\gtrsim10$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14425v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark matter halos and transonic accretion flow <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Avijit Chowdhury, Gargi Sen, Sayan Chakrabarti, Santabrata Das<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Contribution to 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational (Amaldi16) Waves<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their surrounding environment is fundamental to understanding galactic evolution. This work investigates the influence of a cold dark matter (DM) halo on the dynamics of relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic SMBH. Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14377v2" target="_blank"><h2>Magnetic Fields in the Shapley Supercluster Core with POSSUM: Challenging Model Predictions <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> D.

We study the RM signal from the Shapley Supercluster Core (SSC), in order to constrain the magnetic field properties of the gas. The SSC region consists of two galaxy clusters A3558 and A3562, and two galaxy groups between them, at $z\simeq 0.048$. We combine RM Grid data with thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data, obtained from the POSSUM pilot survey, and Planck, respectively. To robustly determine the gas density, its magnetic field properties, and their correlation, we study the RM scatter in the SSC region and its behavior as a function of distance to the nearest cluster/group. We compare observational results with semi-analytic Gaussian random field models and more realistic cosmological MHD simulations. With a sky-density of 36 RMs/deg$^{2}$, we detect an excess RM scatter of $30.5\pm 4.6 \, \mathrm{rad/m^2}$ in the SSC region. Comparing with models, we find an average magnetic field strength of 1-3 $μ$G (in the groups and clusters). The RM scatter profile, derived from data ranging from 0.3-1.8 $r_{500}$ for all objects, is systematically flatter than expected compared to models, with $η<0.5$ being favored. Despite this discrepancy, we find that cosmological MHD simulations matched to the SSC structure most closely align with scenarios where the magnetic field is amplified by the turbulent velocity in the intercluster regions on scales $\lesssim 0.8\,r_{500}$. The dense RM grid and precision provided by POSSUM allows us to probe magnetized gas in the SSC clusters and groups on scales within and beyond their $r_{500}$. Flatter-than-expected RM scatter profiles reveal a significant challenge in reconciling observations with even the most realistic predictions from cosmological MHD simulations in the outskirts of interacting clusters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14369v1" target="_blank"><h2>QHSC: The Quasar Candidate Catalog for the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rui Zhu, Xue-Bing Wu, Yuxuan Pang, Yuming Fu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 25 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables, accepted for publication in ApJS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> QSO (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) is a deep wide-field multi-band imaging survey consisting of three layers (Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep), with the Wide layer covering $\sim 1470$ deg$^2$ to a depth of $i \sim 26$ mag. We present the QHSC catalog, a machine-learning selected sample of quasar candidates with photometric redshifts in the Wide layer of the HSC-SSP survey (Public Data Release 3). The full QHSC catalog contains four distinct samples: a master sample with HSC-only photometry, an HSC+WISE sample, and two samples including near-infrared data from UKIDSS and VISTA, denoted as GoldenU and GoldenV. For each sample, an XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated using independent spectroscopic test sets from HETDEX, VVDS, and zCOSMOS-bright. The numbers of quasar candidates in the QHSC catalog are 1,184,574 (master), 371,777 (HSC+WISE), 87,460 (GoldenU), and 120,572 (GoldenV), with respective completeness values of 85.3%, 92.7%, 89.8%, and 91.3%. We develop ensemble photometric redshift estimators based on bootstrap aggregating (bagging) of multiple XGBoost regressors, achieving outlier fractions of 21.7%, 13.1%, 9.5%, and 10.7% for these samples. The catalog provides quasar classification probabilities (p_QSO), enabling construction of purer subsamples via thresholding. This work offers a valuable resource for studies of quasars and cosmology, and highlights the effectiveness of machine learning for quasar selection in future wide and deep imaging surveys.

The 850 $μ$m image with a $\sim$50 pc resolution yields a comprehensive catalog of 383 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) that are associated with the spiral arms. In addition, it unveiled a population of 189 compact inter-arm GMCs in M31, which are mostly unresolved or marginally resolved. The masses of all these GMCs are in the range of 2$\times$10$^4$ -- 6$\times$10$^6$ $M_{\odot}$; the sizes are in the range of 30--130 pc. They follow a mass-size correlation, $M$ $\propto$ $R_{c}$$^{2.5}$. The inter-arm GMCs are systematically less massive, more diffuse, colder, and have lower star-forming efficiency (SFE) than on-arm GMCs. Moreover, within individual spatially resolved on-arm and off-arm M31 GMCs, the SFE is considerably lower than the SFE in molecular clouds in main sequence and green valley galaxies. Follow-up investigations on M31 GMCs may provide clues for how star formation may be quenched in galactic environments. Finally, we reconstrained the dust opacity spectral index $β$ in the M31 galaxy by combining our new JCMT observations with archival Herschel and Planck data and found that the radial variation of $β$ may not be as large as was proposed by previous studies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14351v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hubble Space Telescope proper motions of Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters -- II.

We analyse the proper motions of the clusters, which have been measured based on multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we infer from the HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for the distances, ages and metallicities of the clusters. This collection of information, in combination with literature line-of-sight velocities, allows us to investigate the full 3D dynamics of our sample of clusters within the frame of the LMC in a self-consistent way. While most young clusters orbit the LMC close to the stellar disc plane, NGC 1850 (~100 Myr old) depicts a peculiar case. Depending on the exact distance from the disc, it follows either a highly inclined, retrograde orbit or an eccentric orbit along the bar structure. The orbits of young clusters that formed North of the LMC centre show signs that might be connected to the resettling motion of the LMC bar structure. Based on the dynamic properties in combination with the positions of the clusters in the age-metallicity space, we find no clear-cut evidence for clusters in our sample that could have been stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) onto the LMC. We finally compare the kinematics of the intermediate-age clusters with a suite of simple numerical simulations of the Magellanic system to interpret the cluster motions. A possible interaction history of the LMC with the SMC, where the SMC had two past crossings of the LMC disc plane (about 300 and 900 Myr ago), in combination with the recent SMC pericentre passage, can qualitatively explain the observed kinematic structure of the clusters analysed in this work.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14344v1" target="_blank"><h2>Plasma oscillations within Israel-Stewart theory <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lorenzo Gavassino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> physics.plasm-ph, astro-ph.HE, hep-th, nucl-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 5 figures, comments welcome!<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It is well known that, at zero wavenumber, the non-hydrodynamic frequencies of uncharged kinetic theory are purely imaginary. On the other hand, it was recently shown that, in resistive magnetohydrodynamics, the interplay between the Israel-Stewart relaxation equation and the Ampère-Maxwell law can give rise to a pair of oscillating non-hydrodynamic modes. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd. Finally, we establish that, in a kinetic theory of charged particles, there can be at most one such pair of oscillatory modes per spatial dimension, while all other modes still must sit on the imaginary axis.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14332v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the impact of the supernova subsamples in reducing the Hubble tension <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gonçalo Martins, Santiago González-Gaitán, João Duarte, Ana M.

We study how differences in colour ($c$), stretch ($x_{1}$), and host galaxy properties-stellar mass ($M$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR)-between calibration and Hubble Flow (HF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples used by SH0ES affect SN luminosity standardization and $H_{0}$ estimates. We generate subsamples from both, estimating $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $α$, $β$, $Δ_{host}$, and $σ_{int}$. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov to assess the consistency between subsamples and reveal how parameter estimates change as sample matching improves. The calibration sample is not fully representative of the HF sample, especially in $M$ and sSFR. Improving sample consistency leads to changes in $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $α$, and $σ_{int}$, though overall values remain broadly stable. Better-matched subsamples tend to yield a mass step consistent with zero within 1$σ$. By disentangling SN subpopulations, we find persistent differences in $H_{0}$ ($\sim$2-3$σ$) and $M_{B}$ ($\sim2σ$) between low- and high-stretch SNe: $H_{0} = 75.27 \pm 1.18$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for low-stretch and $H_{0} = 71.25 \pm 1.59$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for high-stretch, resulting in Hubble tensions of 6.07$σ$ and 2.52$σ$. These differences suggest SNe Ia subpopulations with varying dust and intrinsic colour not captured by a single $β$, impacting cosmology. Estimating a single $H_{0}$ for both subpopulations yields $H_{0} = 73.78 \pm 2.17$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with a much larger uncertainty that lowers the Hubble tension from $5.87σ$ to $\sim2.86σ$. Our results suggest that the mass step may arise from an over-correction of more than one SN subpopulation associated to different environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14257v1" target="_blank"><h2>Positive AGN feedback in the outskirts of nearby barred spiral galaxies? <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bannanje Ananthamoorthy, Debbijoy Bhattacharya, P.

The estimated SF rate (SFR) averaged over 100 Myr for the UV knot ($0.23\pm0.10$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly higher compared to a typical elliptical galaxy. As the galaxy does not show the signatures of recent major mergers, the possible mechanisms for the triggered SF include AGN feedback or minor mergers. Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) observations reveal dust filaments that extend through a UV knot. The origin of dusty filaments, though not clear, could be associated with gas clouds as a result of a minor merger, cooled gas falling into the central BCG and/or condensing of the gas uplifted by AGN jet. No significant clumpy UV emission is observed in other regions along the dust filament.

We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a <= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a > ac) in which eta(a) > 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14216v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the Sources of X-ray Luminosity in DESI Galaxy Groups: Insights from the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> YunLiang Zheng, Xiaohu Yang, Teng Liu, Shijiang Chen, Esra Bulbul, Ang Liu, Yi Zhang, Dawei Li, Xi Kang, Yizhou Gu, Yirong Wang, Qingyang Li, Jiaqi Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 29 pages, 14 figures, ApJ accepted<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract), AGN feedback (abstract), QSO (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1) to investigate the contributions of AGN and extended gas to the total X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of galaxy groups with different halo masses ($M_h$) at different redshifts. The presence of AGN in their central galaxies is identified using multi-wavelength catalogs, including the X-ray counterparts, the ASKAP radio catalog, and the DESI spectroscopic measurements. We apply the stacking method to obtain sufficient statistics for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the $L_X$ for groups with different central AGN properties. We find that the X-ray groups exhibit the highest $L_X$, followed by groups with QSO, radio, BPT-AGN, and non-AGN centrals. Moreover, the $L_X$ of the $M_h \lesssim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups is dominated by the central AGN, while the X-ray emission from extended gas tends to be more prominent in the $M_h \gtrsim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups. In groups where the AGN play a major role in X-ray emission, the contribution from extended gas is minor, resulting in significant uncertainties concerning the extended X-ray emission. When the subset containing the X-ray detected counterparts is excluded, the extended gas component becomes easier to obtain. A correlation has been identified between the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN and extended gas. However, once we account for the positional offset, their correlation becomes less prominent. Currently, the results are not conclusive enough to confirm whether there is a connection between the AGN feedback and extended gas. However, they provide a new perspective on the feedback processes in the history of group assembly.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14207v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exotic compact objects in Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Antonio De Felice, Shinji Tsujikawa<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $φ$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts.

In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $μ(φ) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $μ(φ)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)<{\cal C}<{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $μ(φ)>0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14204v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical simulations of magnetic monopole evolution in an expanding universe <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mark Hindmarsh, Asier Lopez-Eiguren, Riikka Seppä, David J.

We find that during the radiation era, the monopoles find each other and annihilate efficiently enough to keep their density fraction constant, which supports the modelling of Zel'dovich and Khlopov and Preskill in the epoch when plasma interactions can be neglected. In the matter era the density fraction decreases logarithmically. Further work is needed to quantify the effect of the thermal bath, which is expected to reduce the annihilation rate at later times.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14163v1" target="_blank"><h2>Photon rest mass from localized fast radio bursts with improved distribution of dispersion measure from extragalactic gas <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuchen Zhang, Yang Liu, Hongwei Yu, Puxun Wu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The assumption that photons are massless is a foundational postulate of modern physics, yet it remains subject to experimental verification. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$σ$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date. These results indicate that the choice of cosmological model has only a minor impact on photon-mass bounds, demonstrate that FRBs provide robust and reliable constraints, and offer strong empirical support for the massless nature of the photon.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14126v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Origin of the Mg-rich Supernova Remnant J0550-6823 and the Frequency of Similar Events in the Large Magellanic Cloud <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yui Kuboike, Toshiki Sato, Hiromasa Suzuki, Kai Matsunaga, Hiroyuki Uchida, John P.

In the late stages of stellar evolution, intense shell burning can cause distinct convective regions to merge, fundamentally restructuring the stellar interior. Although such phenomena are difficult to observe directly, the observation of ``Mg-rich'' supernova remnants (SNRs) has recently emerged as a potential signature of these events. In this study, we reanalyze X-ray observations of J0550--6823, a SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a new candidate Mg-rich SNR. Our spectral analysis confirms a low Ne/Mg mass ratio of $\approx$1, and its classification as Mg-rich. By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\sim$2--3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\lesssim$10--40\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823. This fraction would be important for understanding the final stages of the evolution of massive stars and galactic chemical evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14089v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological dynamics of interacting dark matter-dark energy in generalized Rastall gravity <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Manuel Gonzalez-Espinoza, Ramón Herrera, Giovanni Otalora, Carlos Ríos, Carlos Rodriguez-Benites<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 9 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-18<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=α\,\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+α)$, with $α$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto ρ_m$, $f \propto ρ_{de}$, and $f \propto ρ_m + ρ_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(Ω_{de}, Ω_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14055v1" target="_blank"><h2>A non-local origin for massive gravity and late-time acceleration <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Susobhan Mandal, S.

Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{μν}\Box^{-2}R_{μν}$, $R^{μνσδ}\Box^{-2}R_{μνσδ}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{ΛCDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14039v1" target="_blank"><h2>Aspherical Remnants of Triple and Quadruple Detonations in Binary White Dwarfs <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Logan J.

This results in the destruction of the donor via either the triple- or quadruple-detonation mechanism, adding significant mass to the resulting ejecta as well as modifying its structure and composition. We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations. The remnants are also varied in their elemental abundances and distributions, particularly for lighter elements, but these have limited observational utility and are sensitive to the properties of the progenitor binary.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15731v1" target="_blank"><h2>Further correction to the STARFORGE methods paper: Planck-mean dust opacities <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Michael Y.

For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\sim 100$--$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows ("flares") from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_ν \sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13929v1" target="_blank"><h2>Thermodynamic Origin of the Tully-Fisher Relation in Dark Matter Dominated Galaxies: A Theoretical-Empirical Derivation <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> V.

We confronted the effectively 2-parameter model with 174 galaxies from the SPARC data, and we found that the rotation curves of 100 galaxies can be perfectly fitted by the model. These galaxies are dark matter dominated, mostly dwarfs, low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness spiral galaxies. We demonstrate that scale-dependent self-interacting dark matter solves the cusp-core issue for dark matter dominated galaxies. More importantly, the structure of the scale-dependent SIDM model produces in a semi-theoretically and semi-empirically way the canonical Tully-Fisher and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations when these 100 viable dwarfs, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity galaxies are taken into account. The behavior of the entropy function $K(r)$ is assumed to be $K(r)=K_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{-p}$. The perfect fits of the rotation curves come for a nearly isothermal and virialized dark matter halo, which naturally predicts the correlation $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{max}}^2$. This correlation holds true empirically as confirmed by the data and we also find empirically $L\sim K_0^2$ from the data, thus the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced semi-theoretically and semi-empirically. We perform the same task and we find theoretically, for dark matter dominated galaxies, that $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{flat}}^2$ which is also confirmed empirically from the data, along with the correlation $K_0\sim M_b^{0.5}$, hence the baryonic Tully-Fisher law naturally emerges in a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical manner.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13921v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-layered Fast Wind observed in XMM-Newton snapshot of Seyfert 1 Markarian 877 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xin Xiang, Jon M.

We present a photoionization analysis of an 18 ks \xmm\ snapshot of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 877, revealing three distinct UFO components with line-of-sight velocities of $0.10^{+0.005}_{-0.005}~c$ , $ 0.04^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$ , and $0.05^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$. These components span a broad range of ionization parameters and column densities, producing absorption features across both soft and hard X-ray bands. Even under the most conservative assumption for the volume filling factor, the fastest component exceeds $5\%$ of the Eddington luminosity, making it capable of driving strong galaxy-scale feedback. The soft X-ray UFO component, despite its lower ionization, shares a similar velocity as a higher-ionization component, hinting at a two-phase medium likely shaped by clumpiness or interactions with ambient material. The density profile inferred from the Absorption Measurement Distributions (AMD) and the positive trend between outflow momentum rate and radiation momentum flux suggest that wind is powered by a combination of radiative and magnetic driving.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13858v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Scoured Spike: Suppression of Indirect Dark Matter Signals by a Hidden Companion <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jaden Lopez, Stefano Profumo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 figures, 33 pages, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A massive "dark companion"-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a "scoured" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $γ_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $γ_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13856v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low-energy Radio Bursts from Magnetar XTE J1810$-$197: Implications for Fast Radio Bursts <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Banshi Lal, Yogesh Maan, Moaz Abdelmaguid, Visweshwar Ram Marthi, Joseph D.

However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars -- to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13849v1" target="_blank"><h2>How accurately can obscured galaxy luminosities be measured using spectral energy distribution fitting of near- through far-infrared observations? <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Duncan Farrah, Kiana Ejercito, Andreas Efstathiou, David Leisawitz, Athena Engholm, Irene Shivaei, Matteo Bonato, David L.

Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below $20\%$. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by $\gtrsim20\%$. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies. We tabulate estimates of systematic bias and random error for use with JWST and other observatories.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13837v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characteristic Decomposition for Relativistic Numerical Simulations: II.

Our analysis shows that the traditional equipartition estimate works well at the kpc scale of the simulation box, but breaks down at smaller scales. We find that the predicted magnetic field strength can be improved at small scales by assuming a constant CR energy density across each mock radio observation. The large-scale mean CR energy density can be estimated by assuming equipartition with the large-scale mean magnetic energy density, or as a function of additional observable quantities such as the star formation rate surface density or gas weight.

This framework addresses the limitations of traditional emulation by focusing on $h$-independent cosmological parameters, which can be separated into those defining the linear power spectrum shape ($\mathbfΘ_{\mathrm{s}}$) and those affecting only its amplitude evolution ($\mathbfΘ_{\mathrm{e}}$). The combined impact of evolution parameters and redshift is compressed into a single amplitude parameter, $σ_{12}$. Aletheia uses a two-stage Gaussian Process emulation: a primary emulator predicts the non-linear boost factor as a function of ($\mathbfΘ_{\mathrm{s}}$) and $σ_{12}$ for fixed evolution parameters, while a second one applies a small linear correction based on the integrated growth history. The emulator is trained on shape parameters spanning $\pm$5$σ$ of Planck constraints and a wide clustering range $0.2 < σ_{12} < 1.0$, providing predictions for $0.006\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} < k < 2\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We validate Aletheia against N-body simulations, demonstrating sub-percent accuracy. When tested on a suite of dynamic dark energy models, the full emulator's predictions show a variance of approximately 0.2%, a factor of five smaller than that of the state-of-the-art EuclidEmulator2 (around 1% variance). Furthermore, Aletheia maintains sub-percent accuracy for the best-fit dynamic dark energy cosmology from recent DESI data, a model whose parameters lie outside the training ranges of most conventional emulators. This demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping approach, providing a robust and extensible tool for precision cosmology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13828v1" target="_blank"><h2>The observed total star formation rate function up to z \sim 6: complementary UV and IR contributions and comparison with state-of-the-art galaxy formation models <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

Similarly, we obtain the UV SFRFs from literature UV LFs, corrected for dust-extinction. First, we fit the two SFRFs independently via a MCMC approach, then we combine them to obtain the first estimate of the total SFRF out to $z \sim 6$. Finally, we compare this SFRF with the predictions of a set of theoretical models. We derived the UV (dust-extinction corrected, from literature UV-LFs) and IR SFRFs (from Herschel and ALMA IR-LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$ , finding that they are mostly complementary, covering different ranges in star formation rate (SFR$ < 10-100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the UV-corrected and SFR$ > 100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the IR). From the comparison of the total SFRF with model predictions we find an overall good agreement at $z < 2.5$, with increasing difference at higher redshifts, with all models missing the galaxies that are forming stars with the highest SFRs. We finally obtained the UV (dust-corrected), IR and total star formation rate densities (SFRDs), finding that there are no redshift ranges where UV and IR alone are able to reproduce the whole total SFRD.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13823v1" target="_blank"><h2>Robust galaxy image decompositions with Differential Evolution optimisation and the problem of classical bulges in and beyond the nearby Universe <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dimitri A.

However, most studies employ fitting algorithms that are prone to be trapped in local minima, or involve subjective choices. Furthermore, when applied on samples beyond the nearby Universe, results on the fraction of classical bulges in disc galaxies do not agree with studies on nearby galaxies. The latter studies point to a small fraction of classical bulges, possibly challenging our merger-driven picture of galaxy formation. Therefore, understanding the discrepancy between observations in and beyond the nearby Universe is of paramount importance. In this paper, I use a sample of 16 nearby galaxies drawn from the TIMER project, which previously have been shown to not host classical bulges, and perform decompositions applying different methodologies and employing the original images as well as artificially redshifted images. I show that the Differential Evolution algorithm is able to provide accurate measurements of structural properties with little subjective intervention, correctly indicating the presence of nuclear discs (not classical bulges). However, I also show that when the physical spatial resolution is not adequate, a systematic overestimation of the photometric bulge Sérsic index leads to the false conclusion of the presence of classical bulges. I discuss how this may be the root cause of the discrepancy mentioned above, and point out how this issue may be a problem even with data from facilities such as Euclid, HST and JWST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13817v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Deep Chandra View of Abell 2597: Bubbles, Shocks, Cold Fueling, and a Plasma Depletion Layer <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Osase Omoruyi, Grant Tremblay, Stefi A.

Radio-mode AGN activity has inflated seven X-ray cavities and driven one to three potential weak shocks ($M \sim 1.05-1.14$) extending to $\sim 150$ kpc, suggesting recurrent outbursts occurring on $\sim 10^7$ year timescales. We also detect a narrow, $\sim$57 kpc X-ray surface brightness deficit-a potential plasma depletion layer-likely shaped by residual sloshing motions that amplified magnetic fields and/or displaced gas within the cluster core. Although the AGN injects $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of energy, comparable to the cluster's cooling luminosity, radiative cooling persists at $\sim$15 M$_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$, replenishing the billion solar mass cold gas reservoir at the heart of the brightest cluster galaxy. Sustaining this level of activity requires a continuous fuel supply, yet the estimated Bondi accretion power ($\sim 2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) falls an order of magnitude short of the observed cavity power, suggesting that "hot" gas fueling is insufficient. Instead, archival ALMA observations continue to support a chaotic cold accretion scenario, where turbulence-driven condensation fuels the AGN at rates exceeding Bondi accretion, sustaining a self-regulated feedback cycle that repeatedly shapes the core of Abell 2597.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13818v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Mergers Collectively Illuminate the $γ$-Ray Sky <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jaya Doliya, Deep Jyoti Das, Subhadip Bouri, Pooja Bhattacharjee, Mousumi Das, Ranjan Laha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> v1: 23 pages, 6 figures; Comments welcome.

Galaxy mergers are proposed as very high-energy CR accelerators, which are expected to produce high-energy (HE) $γ$ rays and neutrinos through interactions with the ambient gas and low-energy background radiation fields. For the first time, we systematically study the HE $γ$-ray emission from galaxy mergers utilising 16.7 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data with the sample list compiled from eight survey catalogs. Our analysis finds 8 galaxy mergers that exhibit $γ$-ray emission with significance $\gtrsim5σ$ in the 1-500 GeV energy range. A stacking analysis of the remaining faint galaxy mergers yields a combined $γ$-ray emission detected at $\sim 35σ$ significance, a best-fit spectral index of $Γ\approx 2.07$, and an energy flux of $\sim \rm 2\times10^{-14}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. We compare the stacked spectral energy distributions of the galaxy mergers with the projected sensitivity of the upcoming $γ$-ray telescope Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Furthermore, we find that 18 previously unassociated Fermi-LAT sources are spatially coincident with galaxy mergers. Our findings establish galaxy mergers as a new class of HE $γ$-ray sources. Future neutrino and $γ$-ray observatories will be crucial to discover the particle acceleration mechanism in these newly identified CR sources.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13811v1" target="_blank"><h2>Steady-State or Not?

In this work, we present a time-dependent modelling of CR electron spectra in a galactic context using the CREST code, applied to magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-mass galaxy performed with AREPO. CR electrons are injected at supernova sites and evolved with adiabatic changes and cooling processes on Lagrangian tracer particles, including losses from synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung, and Coulomb interactions. We compare these fully time-dependent spectra to local and global steady-state models computed with CRAYON+, as well as to one-zone analytic steady-state solutions. We find that the global CR electron spectrum in the simulated galactic disk closely resembles a steady-state solution up to energies of 500 GeV, with deviations only at higher energies where cooling times become shorter than injection timescales. High-energy electrons are dominated by recently injected populations that have not yet reached equilibrium, however, producing a steeper spectrum and lower normalisation than a steady-state model predicts. Spatially, the electrons modelled on-the-fly with CREST are more confined to the star-forming disk, in contrast to the more extended distributions from steady-state post-processing models. Our results demonstrate that while steady-state assumptions capture the bulk CR electron population in star-forming disks, a time-dependent treatment is essential to describe the high-energy and outflowing components.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13815v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stripped-Envelope Supernovae for QCD Axion Detection <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Francisco R.

If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $Λ$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13669v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Dark Energy Constraint from Strongly Lensed AGN at LSST-Scale <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sydney Erickson, Martin Millon, Padmavathi Venkatraman, Tian Li, Philip Holloway, Phil Marshall, Anowar Shajib, Simon Birrer, Xiang-Yu Huang, Timo Anguita, Steven Dillmann, Narayan Khadka, Kate Napier, Aaron Roodman, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitting to the Open Journal of Astrophysics, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13666v1" target="_blank"><h2>A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rayff de Souza, Agripino Sousa-Neto, Javier E.

These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $Λ$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $Λ$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13651v1" target="_blank"><h2>High-resolution radio imaging of TGSSJ1530+1049, a radio galaxy in a dense environment at z=4 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> K.

TGSSJ1530+1049 was selected as a candidate high-redshift radio galaxy. Subsequent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presented in a companion paper (Saxena et al., submitted) have shown that it is located at a redshift z=4.0. The JWST data furthermore showed that the radio source is part of one of the densest structures of galaxies and ionized gas known at these redshifts. The complex system qualitatively resembles a massive (cluster) galaxy forming early through a rapid succession of mergers. TGSSJ1530+1049 is an unresolved source down to ~0.6" scale in multiple radio surveys. To reveal its high-resolution radio structure and allow for a detailed comparison with JWST observations, we studied its morphology at various angular scales with different radio interferometric instruments. We observed TGSSJ1530+1049 at milliarcsecond (mas) scale angular resolution with the European VLBI Network (EVN), and at ~100-mas scale resolution with the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN). We recovered a complex north--south oriented structure with steep-spectrum radio-emitting features, which are associated with lobes and hot spots of a jetted active galactic nucleus. The centre of the radio galaxy proved to be too faint at cm wavelengths to be unambiguously detected in our observations. Nevertheless, the linear size (~5.5 kpc) and the radio power place it among the so-called medium-sized symmetric objects, a smaller and/or confined version of larger radio galaxies. Comparison between the radio morphology and that of the ionized gas observed by JWST shows that the two are closely aligned. However, the optical emission line gas extends out to ~25 kpc, which is well beyond the detected radio structures.

NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy ($R=2700$) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\star/M_\odot)>10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\approx10^{13} M_\odot$. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13642v2" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational--Electromagnetic Coupling on Kerr Spacetime <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fawzi Aly, Dejan Stojkovic<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime.

Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes.

We detect broadened HeII $λ$1640 and $λ$4687 (FWHM$\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$) and strong NIII] $λ$4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity ($12+\log(\rm O/H)= 7.749\pm0.023$), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement ($\log(\rm N/O)=-0.390\pm0.035$ from N$^+$, N$^{+2}$, and N$^{+3}$) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst ($\sim3-6$ Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high$-z$ implies a $\sim50$ Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13585v1" target="_blank"><h2>High Resolution Observations of CO(3-2) in Haro 2: Cool Molecular Outflows of a Ly$α$ Emitter <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sara Beck, Pei-Ying Hsieh, Jean Turner<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Revised version submitted to AJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title), outflow (title, abstract), LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Haro 2 is a blue compact dwarf galaxy and the closest (at 21Mpc) known $Lyα$ emitter. UV and optical observations have found Haro 2 to be immersed in shells of partly ionized gas expanding at $\sim200$km/s. Observations of CO(2-1) (Becket et al 2020; Paper 1) with moderate ($2^{\prime\prime}$) resolution discovered a large-scale one-sided outflow associated with a soft X-ray bubble and apparently driven by the young star clusters created in the recent starburst. We present here SMA observations of CO(3-2) with $1.1^{\prime\prime}$ resolution in Haro 2. The opposite-side component of the large molecular outflow is detected lying in the direction of the fast ionized outflow; it is very confined in area. An additional outflow is apparent in the CO(3-2); it is south-east of the galaxy in a region holding weak star formation and a moderate-luminosity hard X-ray source. All the molecular outflow and filament velocities are within $\lesssim\pm50$km/s of the systemic velocity of the galaxy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13562v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bimodular Gravity: Unimodularising Bimetric Scalar-Tensor Gravity <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> James Hallam, João Magueijo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, presenting the results of an MSc Thesis<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It is the object of the present paper to unimodularise a disformal bimetric scalar-tensor theory, thereby defining what we call bimodular gravity. We impose one unimodular constraint per metric via multipliers $λ_{1,2}$ and show that two natural implementations-a dual fixed-determinant (BUG) and a dual diffeomorphism-invariant (BHT/BDUG) formulation-are classically inequivalent. In BUG the relative volume element $ν=\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the "bimodular cosmological constant" $Λ=λ_1+νλ_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $λ_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $ν$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical. Recasting the theory in an Einstein-frame form, we derive the biscalar sound speed and identify a subluminal domain $1+B(V+λ_2)>0$. At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations. Finally, we present a diffeomorphism-invariant completion that correlates the two HT volume forms, reproducing the $Λ$ of BUG on shell whilst maintaining full covariance.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13395v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PAH 3.4 micron feature as a tracer of shielding in the Orion Bar and NGC 6240 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> N.

For the first time in an external galaxy (NGC 6240), we have identified two distinct spectral components of the PAH 3.4 micron feature: a shorter wavelength component at 3.395 micron, which we attribute to short aliphatic chains tightly attached to the aromatic rings of the PAH molecules; and a longer wavelength feature at 3.405 microns that arises from longer, more fragile, aliphatic chains that are weakly attached to the parent PAH molecule. These longer chains are more easily destroyed by far-ultraviolet photons (>5eV) and PAH thermal emission only occurs where PAH molecules are shielded from more energetic photons by dense molecular gas. We see a very strong correlation in the morphology of the PAH 3.395 micron feature with the PAH 3.3 micron emission, the latter arising from robust aromatic PAH molecules. We also see an equally strong correlation between the PAH 3.405 micron morphology and the warm molecular gas, as traced by H2 vibrational lines. We show that the flux ratio PAH_3.395/PAH_3.405 < 0.3 corresponds strongly to regions where the PAH molecules are shielded by dense molecular gas, so that only modestly energetic UV photons penetrate to excite the PAHs. Our work shows that PAH 3.405 micron and PAH 3.395 micron emission features can provide robust diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in external galaxies, and can be used to quantify the energies of the photon field penetrating molecular clouds.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13393v1" target="_blank"><h2>Learning Cosmology from Nearest Neighbour Statistics <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Atrideb Chatterjee, Arka Banerjee, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Tom Abel<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted for publication to A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), Euclid (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extracting cosmological parameters from galaxy/halo catalogues with sub-percent level accuracy is an important aspect of modern cosmology, especially in view of ongoing and upcoming surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and LSST. While traditional two-point statistics have been known to be suboptimal for this task, recently proposed k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) based summary statistics have demonstrated tighter constraining power. Building on the kNN statistics, we introduce a new field-level representation of discrete halo catalogues - NN distance maps. We employ this technique on the halo catalogues obtained from Quijote N-body simulation suites. By combining these maps with kNN-based summary statistics, we train a hybrid neural network to infer cosmological parameters, showing that the resulting constraints achieve state-of-the-art, if not the best, accuracy. In addition, our hybrid framework is 5-10 times more computationally efficient than some of the existing point-cloud-based ML methods.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13328v2" target="_blank"><h2>Foreground removal in HI 21 cm intensity mapping under frequency-dependent beam distortions <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Athanasia Gkogkou, Victor Bonjean, Jean-Luc Starck, Marta Spinelli, Panagiotis Tsakalides<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), CGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping with single-dish experiments is a powerful approach for probing cosmology in the post-reionization epoch. However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_ν\sim 0.3$ and achieves $\lesssim 5\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 < \ell < 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\ell \sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13314v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the nature of the Einstein Probe transient EP 241021a <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

The event was not detected in gamma-rays. Follow-up observations from $\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay. The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components. Early optical-to-X-ray spectral indices agree with optically thin synchrotron emission, while steepening of the optical SED after $\sim$20 days indicates either a shift in emission mechanism or the emergence of an additional component. Although broad-lined absorption features are absent, comparisons with type Ic-BL supernovae suggest a SN contribution at late times, suggesting a collapsar origin for EP 241021a. The likely SN in EP 241021a appears to require an additional energy source beyond $^{56}$Ni decay. These results support the view that some fast X-ray transients detected by the \emph{Einstein Probe} arise from massive stellar explosions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13265v1" target="_blank"><h2>TransFit-CSM: A Fast, Physically Consistent Framework for Interaction-Powered Transients <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yu-Hao Zhang, Liang-Duan Liu, Ze-Xin Du, Guang-Lei Wu, Jing-Yao Li, Yun-Wei Yu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> time-domain (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present TransFit-CSM, a fast and physically consistent framework for modeling interaction-powered transients. The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables. Because it is both computationally efficient and physically grounded, TransFit-CSM bridges simple analytic prescriptions and radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, enabling population-level inference for current and future time-domain surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13263v1" target="_blank"><h2>Vortex creep heating in neutron star cooling with direct Urca processes in heavy neutron stars <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yoonhak Nam, Kazuyuki Sekizawa<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, nucl-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 14 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Old, thermally bright neutron stars imply internal heating at late times. Among candidate mechanisms, vortex creep heating (VCH) provides a robust link between spin-down and frictional dissipation in the pinned inner-crust superfluid, yet its interplay with fast DUrca cooling in massive stars remains insufficiently explored.
  We (i) implement VCH in our cooling code and validate it; (ii) identify the physically consistent domain where the steady-state form $L_{\text{h}}=J|\dotΩ_\infty|$ applies; (iii) quantify how $(B,P_0)$ regulate observable VCH signatures under DUrca cooling; and (iv) introduce a 3D representation that resolves degeneracies hidden in standard 2D projections.
  Cooling is computed with BSk24 and APR EoS, standard pairing gaps, and iron/carbon envelopes. VCH is modeled with $J\simeq10^{42.9\text{--}43.8}$ erg s, and a quantum-creep coverage fraction $f_{\text{Q}}(t)$ diagnoses when steady-state heating is valid. We survey $B=10^{10\text{--}13}$ G and $P_0=10$--$570$ ms for $1.4$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$, and compare with a curated set of ordinary pulsars with measured $(P,\dot P)$.
  Results: (1) Our implementation reproduces published VCH bands. (2) The $(B,P_0)$ validity boundary follows magnetic-dipole spin-down, confirming consistency with $|\dotΩ|$. (3) DUrca+VCH maintains $T_{\text{s}}^\infty\gtrsim10^5$ K for $B\gtrsim10^{11-12}$ G up to $P_0\sim10^2$ ms. (4) The 3D representation shows that sources appearing coincident in $(t,T_{\text{s}}^\infty)$ occupy distinct $B$-layers, removing degeneracies.
  VCH can substantially reshape late-time thermal states when spin-down power remains high; its observability depends chiefly on $(B,P_0)$ rather than on mass alone. We provide a practical $(B,P_0)$ validity map for $L_{\text{h}}=J|\dotΩ_\infty|$ and advocate treating $B$ as a co-equal axis in cooling analyses.

While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\sim2σ$ level or greater, provided at least $\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10. Our exploratory work shows that LISA may provide a pathway to probe dark matter self-interactions, motivating future work with more realistic, currently-favored models and larger simulation suites.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13148v1" target="_blank"><h2>Prospects for detecting periodic or sharp fast-time features in the supernova neutrino lightcurve with IceCube <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jakob Beise, María Durán de las Heras, Segev BenZvi, Spencer Griswold, Nora Valtonen-Mattila, Evan O'Connor, David Barba-González, Erin O'Sullivan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the XIX International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP 2025)<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Neutrinos produced in core-collapse supernova offer a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport mechanisms during the collapse and play a pivotal role in the shock revival and success of the supernova explosion. Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection.
  A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($>25\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($>50\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5σ$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters. These results highlight the potential of IceCube-Gen2 for detecting Galactic sources more reliably and with greater reach.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13051v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chiral Magnetic Effect induced Spectator Process for Leptogenesis <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Wei Chao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Two column, 8 pages, 2 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-17<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Conventional Leptogenesis mechanism, which provides compelling explanation to the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU), assumes the absence of hypermagnetic field in the early universe, thereby disregard the implications of hyper gauge field helicity, that have been thoroughly studied in the magnetogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we address impacts of a general U(1) gauge field on Leptogenesis by deriving equation of motions for the helicity and the energy density of a general magnetic field, to which the chiral magnetic effect (CME) is identified as essential, and studying their effects on the evolution chiral asymmetries. Notably, CME in the $U(1)_{\mathbf{L}_i-\mathbf{L}_j}$ framework, where $\mathbf{L}_{i,j}$ means specific lepton flavor, explicitly breaks the total lepton number and provides an efficient spectator process, that can wash out pre-existing lepton asymmetries. This establishes a natural connection to the wash-in Leptogenesis paradigm. We demonstrate that this spectator effect enables the generation of the BAU, eliminating the need for both an initial $\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{L}$ charge and primordial helicity.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13024v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGN feedback in merging galaxies with a SMUGGLE multiphase ISM <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Aneesh Sivasankaran, Laura Blecha, Paul Torrey, Luke Zoltan Kelley, Aklant Bhowmick, Mark Vogelsberger, Lars Hernquist, Federico Marinacci, Laura V.

We use Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE) to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) and employ sub-grid dynamical friction for massive black holes (BHs). Furthermore, we use a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at $\sim10-100\,$pc scales. By comparison between merging and isolated galaxies, with and without AGN feedback, we identify trends in the complex interplay between dynamics, BH fueling and feedback, and star formation and feedback. We consider three galaxy types: Milky Way analogs, Sbc-type galaxies, and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) analogs. The synergy between AGN feedback and merger dynamics is strongest in the Milky Way-like mergers, where the AGN winds are energetically dominant and entrain more gas when the initially thin disks become thick and amorphous during the merger. In contrast, the merger of thicker, vigorously star-forming Sbc galaxies is not strongly impacted by AGN feedback until star formation declines in the post-merger phase. Finally, while the sub-grid dynamical friction prescription effectively retains BHs in galactic nuclei during more massive mergers, the clumpy multiphase ISM induces significant wandering of low-mass BHs $\mathrm{(<10^5M_\odot)}$ in the shallow potentials of the SMC-like galaxies. These low-mass BHs wander at distances $\gtrsim 2$ kpc from the galactic center, yielding negligible BH accretion and feedback. This has implications for LISA event rates and present a further challenge to understanding the rapid growth of $z\sim7-10$ quasars discovered by JWST.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13008v1" target="_blank"><h2>Helical Magnetic Field in the Acceleration--Collimation Zone of the M87 Jet <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jongho Park, Kazuya Takahashi, Kenji Toma, Kazuhiro Hada, Masanori Nakamura, Hung-Yi Pu, Keiichi Asada, Paul T.

A key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models is a transition from poloidally dominated fields near the engine to toroidally dominated fields downstream, yet direct tests within the ACZ are hampered by weak polarization and strong Faraday rotation. We report quasi-simultaneous, high-sensitivity, multifrequency very long baseline interferometric polarimetry of M87 spanning 1.4-24.4GHz. We present high-fidelity, Faraday rotation-corrected maps of intrinsic linear polarization that continuously resolve the ACZ in the de-projected distance range of ~9e3 to ~3.6e5 gravitational radii from the black hole. The maps reveal pronounced north-south asymmetries in fractional linear polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA), peaking in the inner ACZ at a projected distance of ~20mas along the jet and remaining prominent out to ~100mas. These signatures are best reproduced by models with a large-scale, ordered helical field that retains a substantial poloidal component-contrary to the rapid toroidal dominance expected under steady, ideal MHD. This tension implies ongoing magnetic dissipation that limits toroidal buildup over the ACZ. The handedness of the helix provides an independent constraint on the black hole's spin direction, supporting a spin vector oriented away from the observer, consistent with the orientation inferred from horizon-scale imaging.

In order to investigate the production of P by supernovae, we performed near-infrared (IR) [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of 26 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Infrared Survey Facility and Kanata telescopes, using the narrow-band filters tuned to these lines. By combining our data with archival [Fe II] maps from UKIRT, we detected both the [P II] and [Fe II] emissions in five SNRs, only the [Fe II] emission in 15 SNRs, and no line emissions in the remaining six. Using the observed [P II]/[Fe II] ratios and upper limits for non-detections, we derived the P/Fe abundance ratios, which vary by up to two orders of magnitude among our sample SNRs. This suggests that the production rate of P and/or the degree of dust destruction may differ from remnant to remnant, the latter being due to the fact that P is volatile while Fe is mostly locked in dust grains. We used the mid- and far-IR maps to examine the dust content for the five SNRs where both the line emissions are detected. As a result, we find that high P/Fe abundance ratios in the northern and southeastern regions of Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula, respectively, are not likely due to dust destruction but may reflect an asymmetric ejection of P during supernova explosions. In the Crab Nebula, it is also possible that near-IR [Ni II] emission contaminates the observed flux in the southeastern region, suggesting that the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, rather than the P/Fe abundance ratio, is relatively high in this part of the remnant.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12737v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Images to Physics: Probabilistic Inference of Galaxy Parameters and Emission Lines via VAE & Normalizing Flows <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Rafael Martinez-Galarza<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-16<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), dust (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)--Normalizing Flow (NF) framework for rapid probabilistic inference of galaxy properties and emission line fluxes at $z \leq 0.3$ from SDSS \textit{gri} imaging and photometry.

Moreover, it is bright with little spectral turnover, and its profile perhaps uniquely remains undistorted by scattering far into the decametric band. Here we assemble more than a dozen of the highest quality profiles (30 MHz to 5 GHz) from half a dozen observatories, where possible polarimetric. The pulsar's 2.6$^{\circ}$ core component marks the magnetic axis longitude, and we confirm that this point coincides both with the linear polarization angle inflection point and the zero-crossing of its antisymmetric circular signature -- thus providing the possibility to estimate emission heights over a very broad band using aberration/retardation (A/R). We then carefully fit the profile components with Gaussians to identify and study the subtle asymmetries produced by A/R. We find a consistent A/R in the pulsar's profiles of some 0.5$^{\circ}$ longitude or 2 ms -- corresponding to a putative conal emission height of 200-400 km -- with a formal error of about 100 km. Our analysis finds no evidence whatsoever for an emission height increase with wavelength, the so-called ``radius-to-frequency mapping''. Nor do we find any significant difference in A/R effect between the outer and inner cones.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12550v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sub-millimeter galaxies in hierarchical models: revisiting the need for a top-heavy stellar initial mass function with Bayesian optimisation <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Edward Elliott, C.

We revisit whether a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) in starbursts is required to reproduce both SMG observations and local galaxy properties. Using Bayesian optimisation, we perform an extensive search of the 15-dimensional parameter space of the GALFORM semi-analytical model. This efficient approach converges to optimal parameter values in fewer than 200 model evaluations, representing orders of magnitude fewer runs than traditional methods. We test whether GALFORM can simultaneously match three key observational constraints: the $z=0$ $K$-band luminosity function, the SMG number counts at 850~$μ$m, and the SMG redshift distribution. We consider two model variants: one with a universal solar neighbourhood IMF for all star formation, and another allowing the IMF slope in starbursts to vary as a free parameter. When assuming a universal Chabrier IMF, we find no parameter combination that simultaneously reproduces all three datasets. The model either matches the SMG constraints while grossly overpredicting the local $K$-band luminosity function, or matches the local luminosity function while severely underpredicting SMG counts by factors of 3--100. In contrast, allowing a top-heavy IMF in starbursts enables excellent simultaneous fits to all constraints. The best-fitting model prefers an IMF slope parameter $x \approx 0.7$ (where d$n$/dlog$m \propto m^{-x}$), somewhat more top-heavy than recent models but less extreme than early proposals. Our comprehensive parameter space exploration definitively confirms that, within the GALFORM framework, a top-heavy IMF in starbursts is necessary to reconcile high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies with local galaxy populations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12477v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detection of disk-jet co-precession in a tidal disruption event <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yanan Wang, Zikun Lin, Linhui Wu, Weihua Lei, Shuyuan Wei, Shuang-Nan Zhang, Long Ji, Santiago del Palacio, Ranieri D.

Here, we report the most compelling case to date: a tidal disruption event (TDE) exhibiting unprecedented 19.6-day quasi-periodic variations in both X-rays and radio, with X-ray amplitudes exceeding an order of magnitude. The nearly synchronized X-ray and radio variations suggest a shared mechanism regulating the emission regions. We demonstrate that a disk-jet Lense-Thirring precession model successfully reproduces these variations while requiring a low-spin black hole. This study uncovers previously uncharted short-term radio variability in TDEs, highlights the transformative potential of high-cadence radio monitoring, and offers profound insights into disk-jet physics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12454v1" target="_blank"><h2>The influence of AGN feedback on star formation in red spiral galaxies <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Moreom Akter, Wayne A.

This multi-wavelength dataset combines optical emission line data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with X-ray fluxes from Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray space telescopes. Using diagnostic emission line ratios, we constructed Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams, introduced in 1981 to classify galaxies based on nuclear activity. Our analysis reveals that most red spirals exhibit AGN or low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) signatures, based on optical data, as determined by their location in the BPT, Cid Fernandes, and Mazzolari diagrams. These results are consistent with the presence of negative feedback from AGNs quenching star formation. Conversely, X-ray analysis reveals that many blue spirals exhibit high X-ray luminosities and are situated in the AGN region of emission line ratio diagrams, suggesting that AGN-driven positive feedback may be enhancing star formation. Our findings support the hypothesis that AGN feedback plays a key role in the evolution of spiral galaxies, particularly in quenching star formation and driving the transition from blue to red spiral systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12334v1" target="_blank"><h2>Clustering effects on the Dark Siren determination of $H_0$: A simulation study <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marios Kalomenopoulos, Riccardo Barbieri, Sadegh Khochfar, Jonathan Gair, Robert J.

The optimal technique, the ``bright siren'' approach, requires the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. However, a significant fraction of gravitational waves signals will not have counterparts. Such events can still constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ via statistical methods, exploiting galaxy information from the GWs sky localisation volume. In this work, we investigate the power of this method using high-resolution, cosmological simulations that include realistic clustering. We find that clustering leads to increased convergence of the $H_0$ posteriors, with clear recovery of the input value as early as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events, compared to uniform catalogues, where the posterior remains largely unconstrained, even with $N_{\rm gw}=100$ events. In addition, we quantify the role of catalogue incompleteness. We show that catalogues with completeness levels as low as $f=25\%$ can be competitive with fully complete catalogues, confirming the impact of clustering. Completeness levels of $f=50\%$ perform statistically similar to complete catalogues with as few as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events. This indicates the need to focus on improving gravitational waves detection capabilities, rather than obtaining more complete galaxy catalogues. Finally, we investigate additional properties of the method by taking into consideration physical weights, different observational errors, potential biases from the $H_0$ priors, a variety of detectors' horizon distances, and different methods of catalogue completion and statistical analysis.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12210v1" target="_blank"><h2>Metallicity Effects on Machine Learning Classification of Dusty Stellar Sources in the Magellanic Clouds <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sepideh Ghaziasgar, Mahdi Abdollahi, Atefeh Javadi, Jacco Th. van Loon, Iain McDonald, Joana Oliveira, Habib G.

The five stellar classes studied include young stellar objects (YSOs), red supergiants (RSGs), post-asymptotic giant branch stars (PAGBs), and oxygen- and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars (OAGBs and CAGBs), which are key phases of stellar evolution involved in dust production. Using spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, we trained and evaluated a probabilistic random forest (PRF) classifier with four approaches: (1) separate training on LMC and SMC, including all five classes, (2) excluding the underpopulated PAGB class, (3) combined LMC and SMC datasets, and (4) cross-galaxy training and testing. The model achieved 93\% accuracy on the SMC and 88\% on the LMC across all five classes. In the SMC, PAGB sources were misclassified as YSOs, mainly because of their small sample size (4 objects). When PAGB was excluded, both the LMC and the SMC reached 92\% accuracy. A combined dataset produced the same accuracy, and cross-galaxy training yielded similar results, indicating that metallicity does not significantly impact model performance. A comparison of absolute CMDs for the LMC and SMC confirms their similarity in stellar populations. These findings suggest that environmental metallicity has little effect on ML-based classification of dusty stellar sources, supporting the use of combined datasets and cross-galaxy models in low-metallicity environments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12177v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemically primitive dwarf accretion reignites the inner disk assembly of Malin 1 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Manish Kataria, Kanak Saha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 9 Figures, Accepted for publication in ApJL<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (abstract), ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a detailed kinematic and stellar population analysis of the inner disk of Malin 1, a giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxy with a prominent SB0-type central morphology. AstroSat far-UV imaging reveals clumpy emission features indicating recent star formation. Using MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we identify four star-forming complexes (SFCs) within the inner 10 kpc, each associated with localized ionized gas emission in distinct H$α$ velocity channels. Two of the SFCs, including a far-UV clump, appear on the blue-shifted side ($V_{Hα}=-230~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), while the other two are redshifted. The far-UV clump shows a strong velocity offset ($\sim150~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) and high gas dispersion ($\sim250~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), indicating that it is kinematically decoupled from the rotating disk. The spatial and velocity isolation of these features in the channel map confirms they do not follow regular disk rotation.
  The far-UV clump hosts young (250-500 Myr), extremely metal-poor ([M/H]$\simeq$ -1.69) and $α$-enriched ($[α/Fe] \sim 0.5$) stellar populations, sharply contrasting with the surrounding super-solar gas-phase metallicity. The young stellar populations in each SFC are chemically distinct (similar to the far-UV clump) from the enriched central ISM, indicating rapid, local star formation from primitive gas before efficient mixing with the enriched ISM. Their spatial and velocity segregation, age synchronicity, and chemical homogeneity suggest an origin of gas delivered by a disrupted, gas-rich dwarf on a high-inclination (off-plane) orbit. These results suggest that the central HSB within $\rm \sim 9^{\prime\prime} (14\ kpc)$ radius component of Malin 1 has grown through discrete, externally driven accretion, contributing to its complex, hybrid disk morphology.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12156v1" target="_blank"><h2>3D extinction maps of the Milky Way disc from Gaia GSP-Spec parameters <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

We aim at providing new extinction estimates in the Gaia BP/RP bands to study the dust distribution in the disc, to provide new views of the spatial distribution of extinction and to compare it with tracers of the Galactic spiral arms. We use a highly homogeneous method based on the spectral chemo-physical parametrisation of stars from Gaia General Stellar Parametriser-Spectroscopy (GSP-Spec). This catalogue of 5.6 million stars in DR3, presents the advantage of estimating the stellar atmospheric parameters independently of extinction. The extinction is calculated by comparing the observed stellar (BP-RP) colours in the Gaia bands with the theoretical ones assuming a theoretical Teff-log(g)-[M/H] relation, from the GSP-Spec parameters. Publicly available, 3D high-resolution maps around the Sun are produced through the computation of differential extinction by discretising the dataset into spherical coordinates. Our large scale map covers a region of 4x4x0.8 kpc centred on the Sun with a discretisation of (dr,dθ,dφ)=(40pc,1°,1°). To exploit the higher number of stars in the Sun proximity, we created a smaller scale map focused on the Local Bubble area, with a volume of 1x1x0.8 kpc and a finer discretisation of (dr,dθ,dφ)=(30pc,1°,1°). The produced extinction maps exhibit a strong spatial correlation with molecular clouds and the spiral arms. Interestingly, several regions of the map are consistently present in different tracers as density of gas, of young stars and the chemical pattern of the spiral arms. Our study unveils the link between the distribution of dust, gas, and stars governing the chemical and dynamical evolution of the spiral arms in the Galactic framework.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12021v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dual core system candidates: a sample of objects with large velocity offset between absorption and narrow emission lines <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zheng Qi, Zhang Xueguang, Yuan Qirong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 8 figures, accepted to be published in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), outflow (abstract), kinematics (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a sample of 28 objects at z<0.3 from Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR16) with large velocity offset (> 200 km/s) of narrow H$β$ and H$α$ emission lines relative to absorption lines. Diagnostic classification via the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram indicates that the sample comprises 12 AGNs, 12 composite galaxies, 3 H{\sc ii} galaxies, and 1 object of uncertain classification. A strong correlation is found between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We examine the asymmetries of the narrow H$β$ and find that the correlation between velocity offset and narrow H$β$ skewness is negligible in both blue-shifted and red-shifted systems, suggesting that the rotating disk model may not fully explain the observed kinematics. The sample exhibits an asymmetric velocity offset distribution, with more red-shifted (17) than blue-shifted (11) objects. No significant correlation is observed between velocity offset and line width in blue-shifted systems, while red-shifted systems show a weak anti-correlation for narrow H$α$, which is inconsistent with the outflow model. The similarity in velocity offset between narrow emission lines supports the dual core system. Furthermore, the SDSS photometric images reveal eight objects with two cores and two with merger features. Based on the narrow emission line properties, the objects in our sample represent strong candidates for dual core systems exhibiting velocity offset. Extending this property to higher-redshift populations in the near future may facilitate the identification of merging supermassive black hole pairs at earlier cosmic epochs, providing critical constraints on their formation and evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12017v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ji-Yu Song, Guo-Hong Du, Tian-Nuo Li, Ling-Feng Wang, Jing-Zhao Qi, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 3 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$σ$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $Λ$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2σ$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $Ω_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1σ$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12013v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Impact of Orbital Anisotropy Assumptions in Lensing-Dynamics Modeling <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yan Liang, Dandan Xu, Anowar J.

Our study employs the massive early-type galaxies from the TNG100 simulation at redshifts z = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7. Based on the simulated galaxies, we generate a self-consistent mock dataset containing both lensing and stellar kinematic observables. This is achieved through taking the potential composed of both dark matter and baryons of the simulated galaxies, plus the radial variation of the stellar orbit anisotropy depicted by a logistic function. By integrating constraints from both lensing and stellar kinematics, we separate the contributions of stars and dark matter inside the galaxies. Under three commonly adopted stellar anisotropy assumptions (isotropic orbits, constant anisotropy, and the Osipkov-Merritt profile), the model inferences suggest that the systematic biases in the total stellar mass and central dark matter fraction are not significant. Specifically, the total stellar mass on average is underestimated by less than $0.03\pm0.10$ $\rm dex$ while the dark matter fraction experiences only a statistically insignificant increase of less than $2\%\pm10\%$ at the population level. The dark matter inner density slope in our tests is over-predicted by $0.15\pm0.2$. Additionally, these lacks of significant biases are insensitive to the discrepancies between the assumed anisotropy in modeling and the ground truth orbital anisotropy of mock sample. Our results suggest that conventional assumptions regarding orbital anisotropy, such as an isotropic profile or the Osipkov-Merritt model, would not introduce a significant systematic bias when inferring galaxy mass density distribution at the population level.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11982v1" target="_blank"><h2>First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) XX: Comparing semi-analytic models at high-redshift <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Louise T.

We show that in L-Galaxies and SC-SAM, environmental quenching of satellites is the prevalent quenching mechanism, with active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback having little effect at the redshifts probed. On the other hand, $\sim40\%$ of passive galaxies predicted by GALFORM and SHARK are quenched by AGN feedback at $z=5$. The SAMs are an interesting contrast to the EAGLE model, in which AGN feedback is essential for the formation of passive galaxies, in both satellites and centrals, even at high redshift.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11965v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation of Close Binaries through Massive Black Hole Perturbations and Chaotic Tides <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Howard Hao-Tse Huang, Wenbin Lu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 16 figures, 1 table; to be submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Hills breakup of binary systems allows massive black holes (MBH) to produce hyper-velocity stars (HVSs) and tightly bound stars. The long timescale of orbital relaxation means that binaries must spend numerous orbits around the MBH before they are tidally broken apart. Repeated MBH tidal perturbations over multiple pericenter passages can perturb the binary inner orbit to high eccentricities, leading to strong tidal interactions between the stars. In this work, we develop a physical model of the MBH-binary system, taking into account outer orbital relaxation, MBH tidal perturbations, and tidal interactions between the binaries in the form of dynamical tides. We show that when the inner orbit reaches high eccentricities such that the pericenter radius is only a few times stellar radii ($R_*$), the stellar oscillation modes can grow chaotically and rapidly harden the binaries to semi-major axes $a_b\lesssim 10\,R_*$. We find that a significant fraction (up to 50\%) of initially wide binaries that are in the empty loss-cone regime ($a_b\sim 1.0\,{\rm AU}$) do not undergo Hills breakup as wide binaries, but instead experience chaotic growth of tides and become close binaries. These tidally hardened binaries provide a new channel for the production of the fastest HVSs, and are connected to other nuclear transients such as repeating partial tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11952v1" target="_blank"><h2>SourceREACH (Source REconstruction of Arcs behind Cluster Halos): A New Source Reconstruction Algorithm Optimized for Giant Arcs and Galaxy Cluster Lenses <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lana Eid, Charles Keeton<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal on November 14, 2025<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract), halo (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We introduce a new algorithm designed for use with extended lensed images, specifically giant arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. These highly magnified images contain important information about both the mass distribution of the cluster and the properties of the background source, but modeling them requires significant computational effort. Our new source reconstruction methodology is designed to be accurate and efficient for high-resolution observations in which point spread function effects are not significant. The overall process deconvolves the observed image by the point spread function, de-lenses the image pixels, and uses interpolation or regression with smoothing to determine the model source. By working with de-lensed points, the method accounts for varying resolution across the source plane. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression methods using both mock data and real data for the giant arc in Abell 370. We find that utilizing K Nearest Neighbor Regression results in the best balance of noise smoothing and preservation of compact detail in the source.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11943v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): Identification of massive galaxy candidates at the end of the Epoch of Reionisation <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Euclid Collaboration, R.

In this work, we search for galaxies with stellar masses M* > 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], i.e., towards the end of the Epoch of Reionisation, over a total of ~23 deg^2 in two of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) fields: the Euclid Deep Field North and Fornax (EDF-N and EDF-F). In addition to the Euclid photometry, we incorporate Spitzer Infrared Camera (IRAC) and ground-based optical data to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, obtaining photometric redshifts and derived physical parameters. After applying rigorous selection criteria, we identify a conservative sample of 145 candidate massive galaxies with M* > 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], including 5 objects with M* > 10^11 Msun. This makes for a surface density of about 6.3 deg^-2 at z in [5,7], which should be considered a lower limit because of the current depth of the Euclid data (H_E < 24, 5 sigma in Q1). We find that the inferred stellar masses are consistent with galaxy formation models with standard star-formation efficiencies. These massive galaxies have colour excess E(B-V) values up to 0.75, indicating significant dust attenuation in some of them. In addition, half of the massive galaxies have best-fit ages comparable to the age of the Universe at those redshifts, which suggests that their progenitors were formed very early in cosmic time. About 78% of the massive galaxies lie on the star-forming main sequence (MS) in the SFR-M* plane, ~12% are found in the starburst region, and 10% in the transition zone between the MS and starbursts. We find no significant evidence for outshining or AGN contamination that could account for the elevated specific star-formation rates (sSFR) observed in the ~12% of galaxies classified as starbursts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11936v1" target="_blank"><h2>Through the Heliospheric Lens: Directional Deflection of High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Electrons and Positrons <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Stefano Profumo, Aria Koul, Anika Malladi, Ben Schmitt<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 9 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate how the large-scale heliosphere alters the arrival directions of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and ask if and when this "heliospheric lens" can be ignored for anisotropy and source-association studies - an especially timely topic given, for instance, the persistent cosmic-ray positron fraction and its unknown origin. Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11920v1" target="_blank"><h2>PAH Marks the Spot: Digging for Buried Clusters in Nearby Star-forming Galaxies <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gabrielle B.

We present here a multiband analysis of embedded young stellar clusters in 11 nearby, star-forming galaxies, using the PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-HST datasets. We use the Zooniverse citizen science platform to conduct an initial by-eye search for embedded clusters in near-UV/optical/near-infrared images that trace stellar continuum emission, the Paschen$α$ and H$α$ recombination lines, and the 3.3 $μ$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature and its underlying continuum. With this approach, we identify 292 embedded cluster candidates for which we characterize their ages, masses, and levels of line-of-sight extinction by comparing the photometric data to predictions from stellar population models. The embedded cluster candidates have a median age of 4.5 Myr and an average line-of-sight extinction $\left< A_V \right> = 6.0$ mag. We determine lower limits on source stellar masses, resulting in a median stellar mass of $10^3$ $M_{\odot}$. We use this sample of embedded cluster candidates to train multiple convolutional neural network models to carry out deep transfer learning-based searches for embedded clusters. With the aim of optimizing models for future catalog production, we compare results for four variations of training data using two neural networks. Confusion matrices for all eight model configurations, as well as inter-model identification trends, are presented. With refinement of the training sample, we determine that optimized models could serve as a pathway for future embedded cluster identification beyond our 11 galaxy sample.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11887v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disk mass predictions for binary neutron star mergers: limitations of proposed symbolic regression models <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Francois Foucart<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5p, 2 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Modeling disk formation and mass ejection in binary neutron star systems is an important component in the construction of models for the electromagnetic signals powered by these events. Most models rely on analytical formulae for the disk mass and dynamical ejecta that are fitted to the results of numerical simulations, yet these fits have large uncertainties that significantly limit our ability to extract information from merger observations. In a recent manuscript, Darc et al claim that disk mass formulae constructed using symbolic regression outperform existing formulae and robustly extend to regions of the parameter space outside of the fitting region. I show here that the improvement over the most directly comparable existing model comes mostly from the use of different error measures in optimizing the fitting parameters. For the limited training data used so far, that existing fitting formula has a performance similar to symbolic regression models when optimized over the same error measure. More importantly, I show that many of the formulae obtained through symbolic regression provide unphysical results when used over the whole range of parameters relevant to the modeling of binary neutron star mergers, making them dangerous to use within parameter estimation pipelines. I conclude that fitting formulae with more physics input (e.g. Lund et al 2025), albeit certainly imperfect, remain safer to use in data analysis than these symbolic regression results. Symbolic regression results used in conjunction with careful physics-based vetting may however outperform them in the future.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11886v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing general relativity with amplitudes of subdominant gravitational-wave modes <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ish Gupta, Purnima Narayan, Lionel London, Shubhanshu Tiwari, Bangalore Sathyaprakash<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages + Appendix, 16 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an improved subdominant-mode amplitude (SMA) test of general relativity (GR), which probes amplitude-level deviations in the higher-order modes of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black hole mergers while keeping the dominant quadrupole mode fixed. Using a comprehensive parameter-estimation campaign, we benchmark the test against Gaussian noise fluctuations, waveform modeling systematics, and physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. Although designed to detect amplitude deviations, the test also responds coherently to phase perturbations, yielding apparent GR violations when applied to phase-modified waveforms. Applied to recent GW detections, we report the strongest constraint on the hexadecapolar (4,4) mode amplitude deviation, $δA_{44} = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45}$, consistent with GR.

We constructed a sophisticated three-dimensional radiative transfer model of the AGN source and dusty torus, built upon a physically motivated framework that includes a comprehensive dust grain model. To investigate the properties of the circumnuclear medium, we performed model fitting to a sample of 20 observational spectra from Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS Enhanced Data Products, testing two distinct dust density laws: a steep $r^{-2}$ profile, characteristic of a radiation pressure-driven wind, and a shallower $r^{-1}$ profile, which is a key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Our model successfully reproduces fundamental observational phenomena, such as the transition from 9.7\,$μ$m silicate emission at low inclinations to deep absorption at high inclinations, with absorption features becoming more pronounced for higher accretion rates, dust-to-gas ratios, and black hole masses. Most importantly, a direct comparison of the fitting results revealed that the $r^{-1}$ density law provided a significantly better fit ($χ^2$) than the $r^{-2}$ density law for 18 of the 20 observational spectra. These results confirm the physical consistency of our advanced radiative model and provide compelling evidence that an $r^{-1}$ density law is a more accurate representation of the AGN dusty torus.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11826v1" target="_blank"><h2>ODIN: Characterizing the Three-dimensional Structure of Two Protocluster Complexes at $z = 3.1$ <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vandana Ramakrishnan, Ashley Ortiz, Byeongha Moon, Eunsoo Jun, David Schlegel, Kyoung-Soo Lee, Jessica Nicole Aguilar, Maria Celeste Artale, David Brooks, Maria Candela Cerdosino, Robin Ciardullo, Todd Claybaugh, Andrei Cuceu, Axel de la Macorra, Arjun Dey, Nicole M.

These protocluster `complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$α$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\log(M/M_\odot) \gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11805v1" target="_blank"><h2>LEGA-C stellar populations scaling relations.

The bimodality in the global age-mass relation stems from the different age distributions in the quiescent (Q) and star-forming (SF) populations. A bimodality is not observed in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, although Q and SF galaxies have different distributions in this parameter space. We identify a high-metallicity sequence populated by both Q and weakly SF galaxies. At masses below logM/Msun=10.8 the median stellar metallicity-mass relation of SF galaxies steepens, as a consequence of increasing scatter toward lower stellar metallicities for galaxies with increasing specific star formation rate at fixed mass. With a consistent analysis of SDSS DR7 spectra, accounting for aperture corrections, we quantify the evolution of the stellar age and stellar metallicity scaling relations between z=0.7 and the present. We find negligible evolution in the stellar metallicity-mass relation of Q galaxies and for logM/Msun>11 galaxies in general. Lower mass SF galaxies, instead, have typically lower metallicities than their local counterparts, indicating significant enrichment since z~0.7 in the low-mass regime. The median of the stellar ages of both the general population and Q galaxies has changed by only 2 Gyr between z=0.7 and z=0.1, less than expected from cosmic aging. Some Q galaxies must evolve passively to reach the old boundary of the local population. However, in order to explain the evolution of the median trends, both individual evolution, through rejuvenation and/or minor merging impacting the outer galaxy regions, and population evolution, through quenching of massive, metal-rich star-forming galaxies, are required.

Although these effects have been observed in simulations, the conditions under which they arise remain unclear. Using high-resolution N-body simulations and analytic insights from kinetic theory, we systematically explore the physical origin of these effects. We demonstrate that the overall distribution function (DF) of the host, not just its central density gradient, determines the efficiency and direction of dynamical friction. Core stalling arises when the perturber encounters a plateau in the DF, either pre-existing or dynamically created through its own inspiral, while buoyancy emerges in systems whose DFs possess an inflection that drives an unstable dipole mode. We show that double power-law density profiles with rapid outer-to-inner slope transitions naturally produce such DF features, which is why structurally similar cores can yield radically different dynamical outcomes. Our results provide a unified framework linking the phase-space structure of galaxies to the fate of embedded massive objects, with direct implications for off-center AGN, the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, and the stalled coalescence of black holes in dwarf galaxies and massive ellipticals.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11795v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-Parametric Reconstruction of the Hubble Parameter from the Fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog and DESI Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Grégoire Pierra, Alberto Colombo, Simone Mastrogiovanni<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The release of the fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration includes more than 200 compact binary coalescence (CBC) candidates that can be used to probe the cosmic expansion. The population of merging binary black holes has been used so far to provide a constraint on the Hubble constant and dark matter fraction under the hypothesis of a flat-$Λ$-Cold-Dark-Matter Universe.
  In this work, we provide the first non-parametric constrain on the Hubble parameter from 137 dark sirens reported in GWTC-4.0. We employ the relation between detector and source frame masses for detected GW signals, to obtain a statistical redshift evaluation for the population of binary black holes (BBHs). We model the Hubble parameter as a non-parametric autoregressive process in terms of the scale factor, using splines. In addition, we introduce two novel features: the use of \textit{anchor} points for $H(z)$ derived from an external probe - here, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) - and a constraining power coefficient that quantifies where the inference is most data-driven by GW detections.
  We highlight three key findings: (i) using GWs alone, the Hubble parameter determination is the most GW-data-driven around redshift $z = 0.44$, yielding to $H(0.44) = 92.3_{-36.6}^{+29.9}\rm\, km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$. Its value at $z = 0$, the Hubble constant, is therefore less constrained by the GW data. (ii) The Hubble parameter inferred from analyses assuming a flat-$Λ$CDM cosmological model is strongly affected by the cosmological model assumption. (iii) Introducing an anchor point for $H(z)$ enhances the inferred constraints and provides a clear visualization of the redshift range where GWs contribute most to the constraining power.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11568v1" target="_blank"><h2>Implicit inference of the reionization history with higher-order statistics of the 21-cm signal <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nicolas Cerardi, Sambit K.

The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will offer unprecedented insights into this era through observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal, enabling constraints on the Universe's reionization history. We investigate the information content of the average neutral hydrogen fraction ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$) in several Gaussian (spherical and cylindrical power spectra) and non-Gaussian (Betti numbers and bispectrum) summary statistics of the 21-cm signal. Mock 21-cm observations are generated using the AA* configuration of SKAO's low-frequency telescope, incorporating noise levels for 100 and 1000 hours. We employ a state-of-the-art implicit inference framework to learn posterior distributions of $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$ in redshift bins centred at $z=8.0,7.2$ and $6.5$, for each statistic and noise scenario, validating the posteriors through calibration tests. Using the figure of merit to assess constraining power, we find that Betti numbers alone are on average more informative than the power spectra, while the bispectrum provides limited constraints. However, combining higher-order statistics with the cylindrical power spectrum improves the mean figure of merit by $\sim$0.25 dex ($\sim33\%$ reduction in $σ(\bar{x}_{\rm HI})$). The relative contribution of each statistic varies with the stage of reionization. With SKAO observations approaching, our results show that combining power spectra with higher-order statistics can significantly increase the information retrieved from the EoR, maximising the scientific return of future 21-cm observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11792v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Holes Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Faizuddin Ahmed, İzzet Sakallı, Ahmad Al-Badawi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 3 figures.

We begin with confrontation of predictions from mutated hilltop inflation with the joint analysis of Planck-2018 and BICEP/Keck-2018 data. Subsequently, we extend our analysis by incorporating the ACT-DR6 data in combination with Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck-2018, and DESI-Y1 observations. In both cases, the predictions of mutated hilltop inflation show good consistency with the observational constraints. We have also forecasted the constraints on mutated hilltop inflation model from upcoming CMB experiments, LiteBIRD and Simons Observatory along with their combinations. Here also we find that the prediction from mutated hilltop inflation are in tune with those upcoming CMB experiments. The small-field sector of mutated hilltop inflation, in principle, can probe up to $r\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, resulting in a tensor amplitude consistent with current bounds and potentially detectable by next-generation CMB missions. However, accommodating the high observational value of the scalar spectral index may demand relatively higher e-foldings in mutated hilltop inflation.

Our starting point is the Flagship Simulation Galaxy Catalogue developed by the Euclid Consortium. For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11501v1" target="_blank"><h2>Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer II.

We reconstruct the evolution of the near-IR CIB anisotropies on sub-arcminute scales by known galaxy populations. This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $< 10\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $λ<2\ μ$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11479v1" target="_blank"><h2>Planetary nebulae as tracers of stellar population properties: a pilot study with MUSE <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ana Inés Ennis, Johanna Hartke, Fuyan Bian, Claudia Pulsoni, Chiara Spiniello, Magda Arnaboldi, Roberto de Propris<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages + Appendix, 19 Figures, accepted to MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (title, abstract), kinematics (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Planetary nebulae (PNe) are the only single stars in galaxies outside the Local Group that can be used as kinematic tracers of the diffuse light in the extended halo. Analysing their luminosity-specific number density across galaxies of different morphologies has also shown hints that they may be used as tracers of the age and metallicity of stellar populations. A proper understanding of this relation has been hindered by the fact that simultaneously detecting PNe and accurately measuring stellar properties is extremely difficult using classical narrow-band imaging methods, which cannot detect PNe in the bright centres of galaxies. In this work, we use integral-field spectroscopy to overcome this challenge, analysing the inner regions of a sample of ten early-type galaxies from the Extended Planetary Nebulae Survey (ePN.S) for which archival MUSE data was available. With the Diffuse Emission-Line Filter (DELF) technique, we automate the detection of PNe, and perform spectral fitting on the diffuse light to infer kinematics and stellar population parameters. We compare the PN number density profile and its associated alpha-parameter with multiple properties of the host galaxies. We find that our sample follows the previously observationally constrained correlation with the metallicity of the host galaxy. We find a weak anti-correlation between the alpha-parameter and the FUV excess, highlighting the possible relation between the visibility lifetime of PNe on the spectral energy distribution of their host galaxies, with fewer PNe detected in association with stellar populations characterized by a UV excess.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11396v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modeling the Multi-Wavelength Afterglow of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts with a Plateau Phase <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chen Deng, Yong-Feng Huang, Abdusattar Kurban, Jin-Jun Geng, Fan Xu, Xiao-Fei Dong, Hao-Xuan Gao, En-Wei Liang, Liang Li<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 6 figures, 1 table<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibiting a plateau phase provide valuable insights into the post-merger activity of their central engines. Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray--only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11377v1" target="_blank"><h2>Boost operator approach to the relativistic polarized SZ effect <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Erik Rosenberg, Jens Chluba<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We extend the recent boost operator formalism for relativistic Compton scattering calculations to also account for polarization.

The glitch occurred on MJD~59942(17), with a measured fractional spin frequency step of $Δν_g / ν=1.15(13) \times 10^{-12}$. This event represents the third glitch detected in a MSP, following those in PSRs B1821$-$24A and J0613$-$0200. Although smaller in amplitude than the previous two, the glitch in PSR J0900$-$3144 is of a comparable order of magnitude. The updated MSP glitch rate is $2.5(1)\times 10^{-3}$ glitches per pulsar per year, which suggests it is likely current PTAs will detect another MSP glitch within five years. Using simulations, we demonstrate that such small glitches can go undetected, especially in short datasets such as those from new PTAs, and can bias the inferred achromatic noise model parameters, potentially leading to the down-weighting of the pulsar in gravitational wave background searches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11147v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic foreground residual biases in CMB lensing convergence reconstruction and delensing of B-mode maps <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kishan Deka, Pawel Bielewicz<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, submitted for publication to A&A journal<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Diffused contamination from Galactic foreground emission is one of the main concern for reconstruction of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing potential for next-generation of CMB polarisation experiments. Using realistic simulations we investigate the impact of Galactic foreground residuals from multi-frequency foreground cleaning method on the lensing reconstruction, delensing CMB B-mode maps and constraints of the tensor-to-scalar ratio for CMB-S4-like experiment. We pay special attention to studies of the errors coming from small angular scale non-Gaussianity of the foreground residuals. We show that component separation is essential for the lensing reconstruction reducing Galactic emission contribution to the lensing reconstruction errors by one order of magnitude. The residual foreground contribution is dominated by terms coming from Gaussian components of the residual maps. Errors coming from non-Gaussian components are around three orders of magnitude smaller than the Gaussian one even for recent and the most complex models of the Galactic emission considered in this work. Although the bias in the reconstruction errors due to Gaussian component of the residuals is small, it is comparable to the cosmic variance limit for the lensing power spectrum. For this reason we correct for this bias in delensing of B-mode maps and constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We show also that for the delensed B-mode maps with a simple quadratic estimator, residuals of the Galactic emission after component separation, errors are two orders of magnitude smaller than uncertainties from leftover of the lensing signal. However, for high-sensitivity CMB experiments and more efficient delensing algorithms that remove up to 90% of the lensing signal, the foreground residuals will become one of the main sources of errors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11115v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Spatial Evolution of Star Clusters in NGC 628 with JWST <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Anne S.

Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \ge 10^4 M_{\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10975v1" target="_blank"><h2>A proposal to construct the dark-matter-only counterpart of the observed Universe combining weak lensing and baryon censuses <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shuren Zhou, Pengjie Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5+6 pages, 3+5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (abstract), AGN feedback (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Baryonic effects such as AGN feedback can significantly impact the matter clustering, are harder to model from first principles, and emerge as a severe limiting factor in weak lensing cosmology. To tackle this issue, we propose a generic relation of mapping the observed matter clustering to its counterpart in a dark-matter-only universe. We verify this relation to be accurate at better than $1\%$ level at $k<1\,h/$Mpc and $z\in [0,3]$ in both TNG and Illustris simulations, demonstrating its model-independence to the underlying baryonic physics. Implementing this relation in observations will be made possible by the specifically designed cross-correlation statistics and baryon census (ionized diffuse gas through localized fast radio bursts, stellar mass through galaxy surveys, and neutral hydrogen through 21cm mapping). It is capable of correcting the baryonic effect not only in the matter power spectrum, but also at the field level, as demonstrated by tests on the scattering transform statistics. This approach paves the way for constructing the dark-matter-only counterpart of the observed Universe, establishing an ideal cosmological laboratory for probing the dark universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10968v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of an X-ray bridge between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chong Yang, Nobuhiro Okabe, Yasushi Fukazawa<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in PASJ, 8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report the discovery of a faint X-ray bridge connecting between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550, using {\it XMM-Newton} image. The filamentary structure is found in a model-independent manner in both topological features and Gaussian Gradient Magnitude filtering. The X-ray surface brightness profile perpendicular to the filament is detected at a $5.5σ$ level. Weak-lensing (WL) analysis using the Subaru/HSC-SSP Survey archive data strongly supports the two mass components. Given a prior from the stellar masses, we obtain $M_{200}^{\rm main}=2.68_{-0.92}^{+1.11}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and $M_{200}^{\rm sub}=0.46_{-0.22}^{+0.38}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10825v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMAGAL V.

The fragmentation of massive molecular clumps into smaller, potentially star-forming cores plays a key role in the processes of high-mass star formation. The ALMAGAL project offers high-resolution data to investigate these processes across various evolutionary stages in the Galactic plane. Aims. This study aims at correlating the fragmentation properties of massive clumps, obtained from ALMA observations, with their global physical parameters (e.g., mass, surface density, and temperature) and evolutionary indicators (such as luminosity-to-mass ratio and bolometric temperature) obtained from Herschel observations. It seeks to assess whether the cores evolve in number and mass in tandem with their host clumps, and to determine the possible factors influencing the formation of massive cores (M > 24M_\odot). Methods. We analyzed the masses of 6348 fragments, estimated from 1.4 mm continuum data for 1007 ALMAGAL clumps. Leveraging this unprecedentedly large data set, we evaluated statistical relationships between clump parameters, estimated over about 0.1 pc scales, and fragment properties, corresponding to scales of a few 1000 au, while accounting for potential biases related to distance and observational resolution. Our results were further compared with predictions from numerical simulations. Results. The fragmentation level correlates preferentially with clump surface density, supporting a scenario of density-driven fragmentation, whereas it does not show any clear dependence on total clump mass. Both the mass of the most massive core and the core formation efficiency show a broad range and increase on average by an order of magnitude in the intervals spanned by evolutionary indicators such as clump dust temperature and the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that core growth continues throughout the clump evolution, favoring clump-fed over core-fed theoretical scenarios.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10765v1" target="_blank"><h2>Jeans Model for the Shapes of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yilber Fabian Bautista, Andrew Robertson, Laura Sagunski, Adam Smith-Orlik, Sean Tulin<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> v1: 30 pages (plus 4 appendices), 17 figures, 4 supplementary files<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Jeans model is a semi-analytical approach to modeling self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) that works remarkably well to reproduce the spherically-averaged halo profiles from observations and simulations of relaxed galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, SIDM halos are not spherically symmetric in general since they respond to nonspherical baryon distributions and retain nonsphericity from their initial collapse. In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\rm 200} \sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \; \Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes. We validate our model by comparing to cosmological simulations with baryons for both SIDM with $\sigmam = 1 \cmg$ and collisionless cold dark matter. Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement. The nonspherical Jeans model can be used in conjunction with halo shape observations (e.g., from gravitational lensing or X-ray data) to directly constrain dark matter self-interactions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10747v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hydrogen-Poor Superluminous Supernovae in the Nebular Phase: Spectral Diversity Due to Ejecta Ionization as a Probe of the Power Source <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Peter K.

We measure the properties of key emission features, namely those at 6300, 7300, and 7774 angstroms (associated with [O I], [Ca II]/[O II], and O I, respectively), and find that SLSNe exhibit much wider spectral diversity than normal SNe Ic, primarily in the line ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, which is highly sensitive to ejecta ionization. Some events exhibit weak [O I] and a clear [O II] contribution to the 7300 angstrom feature, enhancing the ratio, along with [O III] lines at 4363 and 5007 angstroms. Other SLSNe show weak or no lines of ionized oxygen. Moreover, we find that the population exhibits decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ over time, while a few outliers instead display sustained high or increasing ratios for extended periods. The ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ is also correlated with the rise and decline times of the light curves, with slower events exhibiting higher ionization, the first robust connection between early light curve and late-time spectral properties, likely due to the magnetar's impact: slower-evolving SLSNe are generally powered by engines with longer spin-down timescales, which deposit more energy at later phases. Among the events with decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, SLSNe with high ionization are on average powered by magnetars with higher thermalized spin-down power, a correlation that is most significant for events with $M_{\rm ej}\lesssim12$ M$_{\odot}$. The ionization in the outliers with increasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ may be due to late CSM interaction. $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ and its evolution are therefore key diagnostics of SLSN engines and progenitor mass loss.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10743v1" target="_blank"><h2>REBELS-IFU: Spatially Resolved Ionizing Photon Production Efficiencies of 12 Bright Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lena Komarova, Mauro Stefanon, Andres Laza-Ramos, Hiddo S.

We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of $ξ_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ for 12 exceptionally bright ($M_\mathrm{UV} \sim -22$ mag) star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 7$ from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime. Notably, in 8 of the 12 galaxies, the spectral coverage includes H$α$, enabling self-consistent dust attenuation estimates in both the ionized gas and stellar continuum via the Balmer decrement and rest-UV slope, respectively. We find global $\logξ_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ values ranging from $25.19\pm0.11$ to $25.61\pm0.11$, with a weighted mean of $25.44\pm0.15$, consistent with the canonical value of $\sim25.3$. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from $24.52\pm0.21$ to $26.18\pm0.61$. We identify strong correlations between $ξ_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, H$β$ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest $ξ_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ exhibit $\mathrm{EW}_0(\mathrm{H}β) \ge 150$ Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Ly$α$ measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Ly$α$ escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc, Lyα} \sim 2\%$, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our H$α$ measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes $\sim 1$ pMpc, aligned with expectations from Ly$α$-detected systems and reionization models.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10741v1" target="_blank"><h2>REBELS-IFU: Steeply rising star formation histories and the importance of dust obscuration in massive $z \simeq7$ galaxies revealed by multi-wavelength observations <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive ($9~<~\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot})~<~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program. The multi-wavelength data, including JWST NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy and ALMA observations, make this a unique sample for investigating SFR tracers at this epoch. We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, H$α$, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between $50-80$ per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of $f=0.50\pm0.08$, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians $25-120$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above $z=7$ literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift. We show that these rising SFHs mean commonly used luminosity-to-SFR conversion factors, derived assuming a constant SFH over given timescales, overestimate the SFRs averaged over these timescales for our galaxies. We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for $z\simeq7$ galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the $100$ Myr average SFR by a factor of $\simeq3$. Finally, we investigate burstiness indicators in the REBELS-IFU galaxies, finding that the rising SFHs imply that the H$α$-to-UV luminosity ratio is an unreliable probe of bursty star formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10740v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Quiescent Merging Nature of the Coma Cluster Revealed by ICM Velocity Structure <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> E.

Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10739v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hybrid Simulations of Supersonic Shear Flows: I) Particle Acceleration <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Naixin Liang, Damiano Caprioli<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 12 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Supersonic flows are ubiquitous in warm and cool media; their dissipation leads to heating, generation of nonthermal particles, and amplification of background magnetic fields.

We applied a weighted kernel density estimation method to 160,000 galaxies with robust photometric redshifts. We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z\lesssim2.5$, while at higher redshifts ($2.5\lesssim z\lesssim5.5$) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at $z\lesssim1.2$, reversing at $z\gtrsim1.8$, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to $z\sim5.5$. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at $z\lesssim1.2$. Moreover, mass and environmental quenching efficiencies show that mass-driven processes dominate at $z\gtrsim2.5$, the two processes act with comparable strength between $0.8\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, and environmental quenching becomes stronger for low-mass galaxies ($M_\star\lesssim10^{10} M_\odot$) at $z\lesssim0.8$. These findings reveal that large-scale structure drives galaxy evolution by enhancing early mass assembly in dense regions and increasingly suppressing star formation in low-mass systems at later times, establishing the environmental role of the cosmic web across cosmic history. COSMOS-Web, the largest JWST survey, provides accurate and deep photometric redshifts, reaching 80% mass completeness at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim8.7$ at $z\sim7$, enabling the first view of how environments shaped galaxy evolution from the epoch of reionization to the present day.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10730v1" target="_blank"><h2>The signature of major mergers on the hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Isac Barranco-Llorca, David Vallés-Pérez, Susana Planelles, Vicent Quilis<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 10 figures (+ one appendix: 1 page, 1 figure).

We investigate how mergers drive the time evolution of this hydrostatic mass bias, identifying the dominant physical mechanisms and their dependence on dynamical state and merger history. Using a high-resolution AMR Eulerian+$N$-body cosmological simulation, we analyse a sample of cluster mergers within $1.5 \leq z \leq 0$, comparing true and hydrostatic masses derived from gas density and temperature profiles, and tracing their evolution. At $z=0$, the hydrostatic mass bias shows a mild correlation with dynamical state. During major mergers, the bias follows a characteristic trend: a sharp negative dip around the merger time, a transient positive peak, and a gradual return to pre-merger levels. This behaviour is primarily driven by morphological and dynamical reconfigurations of the gas density within the ICM, while thermodynamical processes play a secondary role. The pattern shows no strong dependence on secondary parameters, such as mass ratio or impact parameter, but it can be fitted to a simple time-dependent functional form. This trend is present at radii $r\le R_{\mathrm{vir}}$, although with reduced amplitude and shorter timescales as the radius decreases. Hydrostatic mass bias is closely linked, albeit in a non-trivial way, with the merging history of galaxy clusters. We find that the bias values are weakly correlated with the dynamical state of clusters. Nevertheless, our results give a robust estimation of the hydrostatic mass bias values in the pre-merger, merging, and post-merger phases. These findings highlight the importance of delving deeper into the observational assessment of cluster assembly state in order to improve mass estimations for cosmological analyses.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10723v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reaching for the Edge II: Stellar Halos out to Large Radii as a Tracer of Dark Matter Halo Mass <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Katya Leidig, Benedikt Diemer, Song Huang, Shuo Xu, Conghao Zhou, Alexie Leauthaud<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The diffuse outskirts of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) encode valuable information about the assembly history and mass of their host dark matter halos. However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this "outskirt mass" remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent Sérsic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a Sérsic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\%$. Together, these results provide fitting functions for BCG stellar halos that can be applied to future wide-field surveys to infer halo masses from deep imaging data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10725v1" target="_blank"><h2>Back to basics: Little Red Dots as galaxies and dust-obscured AGNs in a synthetic NIRCam sky simulated with L-GalaxiesBH <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Diego Herrero-Carrión, Daniele Spinoso, David Izquierdo-Villalba, Tong Su, Silvia Bonoli, Pablo Renard<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages (5 appendix), 20 figures.

Understanding their nature is key to placing them within our picture of early galaxy and massive black hole (MBH) evolution. To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration. Using realistic photometric cuts, we select a population of LRDs including both AGN and galaxies. The LRD fraction peaks at 40% ($\sim10^{-4}\rm Mpc^{-3}$) at $z\sim4$. Our LRDs are central galaxies spanning $M_*=10^8-10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$. A population of galaxies with $M_*<10^9\rm M_\odot$ appear as LRDs due to older stellar populations. At higher masses, LRDs dominate the halo and stellar mass functions ($M_{\rm vir} > 10^{11.5}\rm M_\odot$, $M_* > 10^{9.5}\rm M_\odot$), and the interplay between AGN and galaxy emission drives the LRD selection. AGN dominate rest-frame UV-optical emission, while dust obscuration is secondary. LRDs host lighter MBHs ($\sim 10^{6.5}\rm M_\odot$) than non-LRDs ($\sim 10^{7.5}\rm M_\odot$), with fainter emission unable to balance their hosts Balmer breaks. We find no evidence for dominant heavy-seed origin of MBHs. LRD Galaxies (97% hosting MBHs) and LRD AGNs are disk-dominated, with LRD AGNs showing larger bulges formed mainly via disk instabilities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10640v2" target="_blank"><h2>Flexible Simulation Based Inference for Galaxy Photometric Fitting with Synthesizer <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Thomas Harvey, Christopher C.

Synference leverages the Synthesizer package for flexible forward-modelling of galaxy SEDs and integrates the LtU-ILI package to ensure best practices in model training and validation. In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on $10^6$ simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R$^2>$0.99 for M$_\star$) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in $\sim$3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a $\sim$1700$\times$ speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models. Synference is a powerful, scalable tool poised to maximise the scientific return of next-generation galaxy surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10634v1" target="_blank"><h2>Baryonic Feedback across Halo Mass: Impact on the Matter Power Spectrum <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kyle Miller, Surhud More, Bhuvnesh Jain<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), feedback (title, abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Upcoming weak-lensing surveys will probe the matter distribution at a few percent level on nonlinear scales (k > 1 h/Mpc) where baryonic feedback from galaxy formation modifies the clustering of matter. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10631v2" target="_blank"><h2>A Bayesian Perspective on Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dily Duan Yi Ong, David Yallup, Will Handley<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, version 2 typographical correction to prior and neutrino setup<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The DESI collaboration reports a significant preference for a dynamic dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM) over the cosmological constant ($Λ$CDM) when their data are combined with other frontier cosmological probes. We present a direct Bayesian model comparison using nested sampling to compute the Bayesian evidence, revealing a contrasting conclusion: for the key combination of the DESI DR2 BAO and the Planck CMB data, we find the Bayesian evidence modestly favours $Λ$CDM (log-Bayes factor $\ln B = -0.57{\scriptstyle\pm0.26}$), in contrast to the collaboration's 3.1$σ$ frequentist significance in favoring $w_0w_a$CDM. Extending this analysis to also combine with the DES-Y5 supernova catalogue, our Bayesian analysis reaches a significance of $3.07{\scriptstyle\pm0.10}\,σ$ in favour of $w_0w_a$CDM. By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\approx 2.95σ$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $Λ$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10620v2" target="_blank"><h2>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A demonstration of CMB lensing measurement from daytime data <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Irene Abril-Cabezas, Frank J.

This dataset is challenging to analyze because the Sun heats and deforms the telescope mirror, complicating the characterization of the telescope. We perform more than one hundred null and consistency checks to ensure the robustness of our measurement and its compatibility with nighttime observations. We detect the CMB lensing power spectrum at 17$σ$ significance, with an amplitude $A_\textrm{lens} = 1.045 \pm 0.063$ with respect to the prediction from the best-fit Planck-ACT CMB power spectrum $Λ$CDM cosmology.

We combine the EFTofLSS full-shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of BOSS data with the tomographic angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$, $C_\ell^{κg}$, $C_\ell^{Tg}$ and $C_\ell^{Tκ}$, where $g$, $κ$ and $T$ stand for the DESI luminous red galaxy map, Planck PR4 lensing map and Planck PR4 temperature map, respectively. To analyze these angular power spectra, we go beyond the Limber approximation, allowing us to include large-scales data in $C_\ell^{gg}$. The combination of all these probes with Planck PR4, DESI DR2 BAO and DES Y5 improves the constraint on the 2D posterior distribution of $\{w_0, \, w_a\}$ by $\sim 50 \%$ and increases the preference for evolving dark energy over $Λ$ from $3.8 σ$ to $4.6 σ$. When we remove BAO and supernovae data, we obtain a hint for evolving dark energy at $2.3 σ$. Regarding the EFTofDE parameters, we improve the constraints on $α_B$ and $α_M$ by $\sim 40 \%$ and $50 \%$ respectively, finding results compatible with general relativity at $\sim 2 σ$.

This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance. We predict that the axion decay constant should be below $10^9$ GeV to explain the observed dark matter and baryon densities.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10602v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Local Group L-band Survey: Probing Cold Atomic Gas in IC10 with Neutral Hydrogen Absorption <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ioana A.

As a low-metallicity starburst, IC10's interstellar medium conditions could reflect small-scale physical conditions that mirror those of early galaxies, providing a unique window into the heating and cooling processes that shaped the interstellar medium in early-Universe environments. Leveraging the high angular (<5'' ~ 15pc) and spectral (0.4 km/s) resolution of the Local Group L-band Survey, we searched for HI absorption against nine continuum radio sources and detected absorption along three sightlines corresponding to internal radio emission sources within IC10. Using Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer, we characterize the CNM, deriving spin temperatures of ~30-55 K, column densities of (0.6-3.0)x 1$0^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, cold HI fractions of ~ 21-37%, and line widths of ~ 5.6-13.6 km/s. For each individual detection of HI absorption, we find corresponding molecular emission from 12CO (J=1-0), HCO+ (J=1-0), and HCN (J=1-0) at similar velocities and with comparable linewidths, indicating a well-mixed atomic and molecular medium. In IC10, the CNM shows a clear kinematic connection to the high-density ISM, implying a stronger dynamical coupling with molecular gas than in the Milky Way, in line with expectations for low-metallicity environments. At the ~ 15 pc scales probed by slightly extended HII regions in IC10, unresolved CNM clouds likely contribute to line blending, so the observed broad HI linewidths may partly reflect spatial and kinematic averaging.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10589v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Fast Earth-scattering Formalism for Light Dark Matter with Dark Photon Mediators <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Agustín Lantero-Barreda, Carlos Centeno, Bradley J.

In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10587v1" target="_blank"><h2>The relationship between warm and hot gas-phase metallicity in massive elliptical galaxies and the influence of AGN feedback <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Valeria Olivares, Yuanyuan Su, Pasquale Temi, Ryan Eskenasy, Helen Russell, Massimo Gaspari, Philippe Salome, Francoise Combes, Ming Sun, Ezequiel Treister, Kevin Fogarty, Ana Jimenez-Gallardo, Patricio Lagos<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 7 figures.

While it is believed to play a key role in the feeding and feedback processes of supermassive black holes, its origins remain under debate. Existing studies have primarily focused on the morphology and kinematics of warm ionized gas. This work aims to provide a new perspective on warm (10,000 K) ionized gas and its connection to X-ray-emitting hot gas (>10^6 K) by measuring and comparing their metallicities. We conducted a joint analysis of 13 massive elliptical galaxies using MUSE/VLT and Chandra observations. Emission-line ratios were measured for the warm ionized gas using MUSE observation, and used to infer the ionization mechanisms and derive metallicities of the warm ionized gas using HII, and LIN(E)R calibrations. We also computed the warm phase metallicity using X-ray/EUV, and pAGB stars models. For two sources at higher redshift, direct Te method was also used to measure warm gas metallicities. Our observations reveal that most sources exhibit composite ionization, with contributions from both star formation and LINER-like emission. A positive linear correlation was found between the gas-phase metallicities of the warm and hot phases, ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 Zsun, and suggest the intimate connection between the two gas phases, likely driven by gas cooling and/or mixing. In some sources the warm gas metallicity shows a central drop. A similar radial trend has been reported for the hot gas metallicity in some galaxy clusters. The ionization mechanisms of cooling flow elliptical galaxies are diverse, suggesting multiple channels for powering the warm ionized gas. The large variation in the warm gas metallicity further suggests that cold gas mass derived under the assumption of solar metallicity for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor needs to be revised by approximately an order of magnitude.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10582v1" target="_blank"><h2>Co-evolution of baryons and dark matter halos of LYRA dwarf galaxies <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Joaquin Sureda, Shaun T.

Based on the age of stars in these galaxies at $z=0$, $40-100\%$ of their stellar mass was formed by the time of reionization, when star formation (SF) abruptly shuts down. Depending on their halo mass evolution, some of the dwarfs reignite SF post-reionization (rejuvenators), while others remain quenched for the rest of cosmic time (reionization relics). However, the stellar mass of relics can still grow by more than $50\%$ through mergers post-reionisation. We find clear correlations between metallicity distributions of the galaxies and the fraction of stars formed post-reionization ($f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$) such that relics have lower median $\rm [Fe/H]$ with a more prominent low metallicity tail. Moreover, the shape of the galaxies at $z=0$ correlates with their $f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$, with rejuvenators showing more spherical stellar distribution than relics. This difference arises only post-reionization when rejuvenators become rounder with more SF activity. Similarly, the shape of dark matter (DM) halos in the inner regions display more spherical distributions in rejuvenators than in relics. The shape evolution shows that DM haloes in all galaxy formation simulations become rounder in comparison to their collision-less, DM-only counterparts. However, DM haloes of rejuvenators evolve more significantly. We do not find any correlation between SF activity and formation of shallow DM density cores in these galaxies. These predictions can be tested using upcoming observational data. In particular, our results indicate that the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation in the low mass regime is correlated with SF histories and the shape of galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10581v1" target="_blank"><h2>UHECRs Propagation and their Multimessengers: Upper limits and the Impact of the Extragalactic Magnetic Field <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rodrigo Sasse, Rubens Costa, Adriel G.

This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068.

LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$σ$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\lesssim3$~$μ$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641~Sgr system.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10529v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shapiro Delay Measurements from Fifteen Years of PSR J1231$-$1411 Radio Observations <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> H.

This millisecond pulsar is a primary science target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer telescope (NICER, which discovered its X-ray pulsations), has accumulated near-continuous $γ$-ray data since the Fermi-Large Area Telescope's launch, and has been studied extensively with the Green Bank and Nançay radio telescopes. We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10486v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revealing the Connection Between the Filamentary Hierarchy and Star Cluster Formation in a Simulated NGC 628 Galaxy <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tamara Koletic, Rachel Pillsworth, Ralph E.

New JWST images of NGC 628 in particular, show clusters forming along the two spiral arms of this galaxy. In this paper we investigate filament and cluster properties in an NGC 628-like multi-scale high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use a filament finding tool to identify filaments and derive the probability density functions (PDFs) for the filament lengths and masses. Using a clustering algorithm we identify star clusters formed between 268 to 278 Myr and follow this population as the galaxy evolves for 60 Myr, calculating their mass PDFs, average radius growth rate, and average mass loss rate. We find a power-law index of alpha_m = -1.35 for the filament masses. Calculating the power-law index from our cluster mass PDF, we find a value of alpha_{c,m} = -1.35 when the clusters first form, exactly our filament mass power-law index. This shows that properties of young clusters arise from the gravitational fragmentation of their host filaments. We track the post-formation evolution of the clusters as they become unbound, increase in radius and decrease in mass yielding an ever steeper mass power-law index. After 60 Myr, the mass power-law index is alpha_{c,m} = -1.55, matching other simulations and observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10464v1" target="_blank"><h2>Correlations of ALMA CO(2-1) with JWST mid-infrared fluxes down to scale of $\lesssim$100 parsec in nearby star-forming galaxies from PHANGS <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tao Jing, Cheng Li<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 13 figures.

Jing & C. Li (2025) that effectively handles uncertainties and outliers in datasets, to 19 nearby star-forming galaxies in the PHANGS sample. We find that for the majority of the data points in all galaxies, the scaling of ${I_{\rm CO}}$ with ${I_{\rm F770W, PAH}}$, ${I_{\rm F1130W}}$, and ${I_{\rm F2100W}}$ can be well described by log-linear relations, though with substantial dependence on ionization conditions (i.e., HII-like, composite-like, and AGN-like). Under given ionization conditions, significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations are identified, and are primarily attributed to variations of intercept $b$, which exhibits clear bimodality. This bimodality is related to the overall host galaxy star formation strength. The differences in slope $k$ and intrinsic scatter $σ$ across different MIR bands (${I_{\rm F770W, PAH}}$, ${I_{\rm F1130W}}$, and ${I_{\rm F2100W}}$) are minor compared to their galaxy-to-galaxy variations. All parameters ($k$, $b$, and $σ$) depend on the spatial scale of measurement, suggesting that the coupling among CO, PAH, and dust is regulated by different mechanisms at varying scales. We identify non-log-linear behaviors in the brightest regions, where deviations are primarily characterized by flattening of slope. No significant (3$σ$) correlations are found between global properties and the best-fit parameters. We discuss the comparison to previous studies and plausible physics behind the statistical results obtained in this work.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10445v1" target="_blank"><h2>How much can we learn from resolved stellar kinematics of galactic haloes using action-based dynamical models? <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Paula Gherghinescu, Eugene Vasiliev, Payel Das, Justin Read<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy formation (abstract), kinematics (title), halo (title, abstract), haloes (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dynamical models are used to study dark matter (DM) in galaxies, how galaxies assemble through mergers, and to test galaxy formation models. Despite its widespread use, there has been no systematic study quantifying how much information can be obtained from just two on-sky positions and line-of-sight velocities, which are typically available for nearby external galaxies. In this work, we introduce axisymmetric, action-based dynamical models that use the positions and velocities of stellar halo stars to jointly constrain the total mass distribution of galaxies and the underlying DM component, as well as the stellar halo phase-space distribution. We rigorously test the method using both idealised equilibrium galaxy mocks and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Auriga suite, systematically assessing how its performance degrades as the available phase-space information is progressively reduced. We further examine the impact of galaxy inclination, modelling assumptions, and methodological systematics on the recovered mass profiles. A crucial development in this work is the improved marginalisation of the model likelihood over missing phase-space dimensions. Our models successfully recover the total and DM mass distributions, as well as the kinematic properties of the stellar tracers, within the derived confidence intervals. However, we find that with limited (3D or 4D) phase-space information, the flattening of the DM halo cannot be constrained with any degree of certainty. Nevertheless, the recovered mass profile is insensitive to the flattening. This finding is independently validated by Schwarzschild modelling tests.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10427v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extending the Frontier of Spatially-Resolved Supermassive Black Hole Mass Measurements to at $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$: Simulations with ELT/MICADO High-Resolution Mass Models and HARMONI Integral-Field Stellar Kinematics <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dieu D.

We investigate the potential of the Extremely Large Telescope's (ELT) first-light instruments, MICADO and HARMONI, to extend these dynamical measurements to galaxies at redshift $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$. We select a sample of five bright, massive, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, adopting their Sérsic profiles from HST photometry as their intrinsic surface brightness distributions. Based on these intrinsic models, we generate mock MICADO images using SimCADO and mock HARMONI integral-field spectroscopic data cubes using HSIM. The HARMONI simulations utilize input stellar kinematics derived from Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). We then process these mock observations: the simulated MICADO images are fitted with Multi-Gaussian Expansion to derive stellar mass models, and stellar kinematics are extracted from mock HARMONI cubes with pPXF. Finally, these derived stellar mass models and kinematics are used to constrain JAM dynamical models within a Bayesian framework. Our analysis demonstrates that SMBH masses can be recovered with an accuracy of $\sim$10%. We find that MICADO can provide detailed stellar mass models with $\sim$1 hour of on-source exposure. HARMONI requires longer minimum integrations for reliable stellar kinematic measurements of SMBHs. The required on-source time scales with apparent brightness, ranging from 5-7.5 hours for galaxies at $z\approx1$ (F814W, 20-20.5 mag) to 5 hours for galaxies at $1<z\lesssim2$ (F160W, 20.8 mag). These findings highlight the ELT's capability to push the frontier of SMBH mass measurements to $z\approx2$, enabling crucial tests of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution at the top end of the galaxy mass function.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10415v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bubble Friction in Symmetry-Restoring Transitions <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrew J.

This process is enhanced in the soft limit, and is known to produce a significant frictional effect that is proportional to the Lorentz factor $γ$ of the bubble wall, thereby prohibiting runaway behavior. We calculate the analogous pressure for phase transitions with symmetry restoration. In such transitions, we show that the pressure due to this process can be $\textit{negative}$, producing the opposite effect. However, when the Lorentz factor of the wall gets very large, the result approaches the same scaling as the standard scenarios. Therefore, phase transitions with symmetry restoration can feature an intermediate negative friction regime even in the presence of significant interactions with the plasma, and the bubble wall terminal Lorentz factor can be significantly larger (by more than an order of magnitude) than in the corresponding symmetry-breaking scenarios. This can carry important implications for various phenomenological applications, from gravitational waves to physics beyond-the-Standard-Model.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10353v2" target="_blank"><h2>Ginnungagap -- a massively parallel cosmological initial conditions generator <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sergey Pilipenko, Gustavo Yepes, Stefan Gottlöber, Steffen Knollmann<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to Astronomy and Computing<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Ginnungagap is a fully parallel (MPI+OpenMP) code designed to generate cosmological initial conditions for simulations involving very large numbers of particles.

Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth.

Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E>10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10317v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Dynamical Scalar Field Model for Dark Energy: Addressing the Hubble Tension and Cosmic Evolution <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Arpit Kottur, Jui Mahajan, Raka Dabhade<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), cosmic evolution (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a dynamical dark energy model based on a canonical scalar field with a hybrid potential of the form $V(φ) = V_{0}e^{-λφ} + V_{1}φ^{n}$. We constrain the model's 11-dimensional parameter space using a comprehensive combination of cosmological data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the Pantheon+ supernova sample, and the matter power spectrum from SDSS. The model provides an excellent fit to the data, with a reduced chi-squared of $χ^2_{\text{red}} = 0.987$, while successfully alleviating the Hubble constant tension. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = 70.0$ km/s/Mpc, reducing the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements. The data favor a negative power-law index of $n \approx -0.92$. A model comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion finds that the standard $Λ$CDM model is still slightly preferred ($Δ\text{BIC} = 2.178$) due to its fewer parameters.

The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10263v1" target="_blank"><h2>Confronting dark energy in Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity with observational data <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mohsen Khodadi, Gaetano Lambiase, Javad.

The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $ω= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($ω= -1$) with a subdominant $ω= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $ω= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $Ω_{\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $ω_{\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $Λ$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $Λ$CDM ($Δ\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10217v1" target="_blank"><h2>Systematic Analysis of Changing-look AGN Variability Using ZTF Light Curves <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Huimei Wang, Xue-Bing Wu, Nanyu Yao, Bing Lyu, Yuxuan Pang, Yuming Fu, Rui Zhu, Qian Yang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), QSO (abstract), quasar (abstract), AGN variability (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) are a unique population of AGNs that exhibit the appearance (turn-on) or disappearance (turn-off) of broad emission lines. This study aims to explore the intrinsic mechanisms of CLAGNs by investigating their photometric variability using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has provided high-cadence observations over the past five years. By visual inspections, we construct a sample of 152 CLAGNs from the literature, all of which show spectral transitions and large optical variability in their ZTF light curves. By analyzing 90 of these CLAGNs and the control samples of Type 1 AGNs, Type 2 AGNs, and extremely variable quasars (EVQs), matched in redshift ($0.2<z<0.8$) and supermassive black hole mass, we compare the color variability, structure function (SF), and variability metric $σ_{\mathrm{QSO}}$, which quantifies how closely the light curves resemble a damped random walk (DRW) model. We find that while CLAGNs and EVQs differ from typical Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs in bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio, the on/off-state CLAGNs share similar variability patterns with the overall CLAGN population, and distinct from EVQ, Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs. This suggests that 'on' and 'off' CLAGNs are not simply equivalent to Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs, respectively. Instead of undergoing genuine transitions between two AGN types, CLAGNs may inhabit a critical state where moderate fluctuations in accretion rate lead to the temporary spectral changes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10204v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing AGN Disks Density Profiles through Gravitational Wave Observations <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiangyu Lyu, En-Kun Li, Changfu Shi, Yi-Ming Hu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Massive black holes surrounded by a gaseous disk have been a prevailing model to explain a wide spectrum of astrophysical phenomena related to active galactic nucle (AGNs). However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\times10^{-11}\rm g/cm^3$. Our work opens up an exciting new channel to investigate the very center of galaxies, where disk gas density distributions $ρ(r)$ can be recovered by analyzing time-dependent environmental imprints in gravitational waveforms.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10195v1" target="_blank"><h2>Estimating accretion times of halo substructures in the Milky Way <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hefan Li, Masashi Chiba, Xiang-Xiang Xue, Gang Zhao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> To unravel the formation history of the Milky Way, we estimate the accretion times of six phase-space substructures in the stellar halo, using the orbital frequencies toward two spatial directions ($r, φ$) in spherical coordinates. These substructures, identified in our previous studies, are located in the solar neighbourhood and therefore have high-precision astrometry from Gaia. The uncertainties of the results are determined using the Monte Carlo method, and the significance is established through comparison with random halo samples. The results for the substructure GL-1 in both directions show good consistency and high significance ($4.4σ$ and $4.5σ$), yielding a combined accretion time of $5.59^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ Gyr ago. The substructures GL-4 and GR-1, with smaller pericenters, exhibit higher significance in the less massive potential of the Milky Way, implying that the more massive potential may overestimate the central mass, especially the bulge. The accretion times of GL-4 and GR-1 are $4.0 \pm 0.2$ Gyr with a confidence of $3.3σ$, and $2.3 \pm 0.1$ Gyr with a confidence of $3.7σ$, respectively. Further constraints on the accretion times of phase-space substructures require more precise astrometric data, e.g., by Gaia DR4, China Space Station Survey Telescope and Roman space telescope.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10183v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synchrotron radiation from NGC 470 HLX1 - a hidden hyperluminous accreting neutron star? <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tanuman Ghosh, Shiv Sethi, Gulab Chand Dewangan, Matteo Bachetti, Vikram Rana, Ranjeev Misra<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 4 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the first broadband spectral analysis of NGC 470 HLX1, a hyperluminous X-ray source that exhibits significant flux variability over different epochs.

We show that this process constitutes a novel source of gravitational waves (GWs), analogous to those generated in zero-temperature axion fragmentation, but with distinct characteristics. We quantify the resulting GW spectrum, identifying the peak frequency and amplitude associated with the inhomogeneous axion dynamics. Our results indicate that the GW signal can be enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard fragmentation scenario, while exhibiting a markedly different spectral shape.

In order to study the scale-dependent clustering of massive neutrinos, we develop a fast linear response method, FAST-nu f, applicable to neutrinos and other non-relativistic hot dark matter. Using it as an accurate linear approximation to help us reduce the dynamic range of emulator training data, based upon a non-linear perturbation theory for massive neutrinos, we improve the emulator's accuracy at small M_nu and length scales by a factor of two. We significantly sharpen its momentum resolution for the slowest neutrinos, which, despite their small mass fraction, dominate small-scale clustering. Furthermore, we extend the emulator from the degenerate to the normal and inverted mass orderings. Applying this new emulator, Cosmic-Enu-II, to large halos in N-body simulations, we show that non-linear perturbation theory can reproduce the neutrino density profile in the halo outskirts, 2R_vir < r < 10R_vir , to better than 10%.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09911v2" target="_blank"><h2>JWST View of the Supernebula in NGC 5253.

NGC 5253 is host to an luminous ($L\sim 10^9~\rm L_\odot$) HII region, powered by a giant young star cluster, a possible local analogue to super star cluster formation at Cosmic Dawn and Noon. In this paper, the first in a series about the mid-infrared line and continuum emission in the center of NGC 5253, we present an overview and continuum spectra. The mid-infrared images reveal four sources of continuum emission from hot dust that we identify as luminous HII regions, which are used to define spectral apertures. The dominant continuum source is the pc-scale supernebula core seen at radio wavelengths. We find that the MIR to radio continuum flux ratio for all regions is identical to that of Galactic HII regions. The 9.7 silicate feature is present and strongest in absorption toward the supernebula. Silicate emission is seen in another HII region. PAH features are present, although weak, particularly in the supernebula; the strongest emission is in an HII region only 15 pc from the supernebula core. PAH features at 6.2$μ$m and 11.3$μ$m are detected in all sources. Comparison of the luminosity implied by the ionization to the observed infrared luminosity suggest that at least 25% ofthe photons are escaping the embedded supernebula core, in spite of its high, $A_V\gtrsim 15$, extinction.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09858v1" target="_blank"><h2>GalaxyClusters from the DESILegacy ImagingSurveys.

Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects. For BCGs, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ increases with redshift, showing a slow rise below $z \sim 0.4 - 0.5$ and a more rapid increase above this range. In contrast, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift. The shift in dominance occurs around $z \sim 0.5$, aligning with the steep rise in $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ of BCG.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09850v1" target="_blank"><h2>A precessing magnetic jet as the engine of GRB 250702B <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tao An<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under review by ApJL<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P ~ 2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier.

The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine.

These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy. Our findings evaluate the feasibility of detecting radio transients using 10-second imaging with ASKAP and provide insights into improving detection pipelines and observation strategies for LPTs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09750v1" target="_blank"><h2>Searching for screened scalar forces with long-baseline atom interferometers <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hannah Banks, John Carlton, Benjamin Elder, Thomas Hird, Christopher McCabe<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, physics.atom-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 7 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Screened scalars are ubiquitous in many dark-sector models.

Two key challenges arise: distinguishing the static fifth force from backgrounds, and isolating it from the plate's Newtonian gravity. We introduce the `$Q$-flip protocol', which alternates between interferometry sequences to induce controllable time-dependence, aiding signal extraction and de-trending of transient noise. We further develop an \emph{in situ} calibration procedure to characterise the plate's Newtonian gravity and reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. We show that our proposal could test theoretically motivated parameter space, advancing existing bounds in chameleon and symmetron screened scalar models by $1$ to $1.5$ orders of magnitude.

The polarization levels seen throughout our observations are on average 0.87% +/- 0.05% higher than those of any Type Ib SN~yet studied, suggesting either that it is the most asymmetric of the sample, or if all SNe Ib have similar asymmetry, that it is viewed at a more optimum angle. Significant continuum polarization indicates that the photosphere exhibited a global departure from spherical symmetry at the level of 10%-40% at the earliest times (days 0--40), which decreased to 0%-20% by days 57--90. During the early photospheric phase, the ejecta maintained a near-constant orientation of 12°-20° on the sky, as shown by the dominant axis in the Stokes q-u plane. Polarization signatures in the Fe II λλλ4924, 5018, 5169 lines shared this axis. Meanwhile, high levels of polarization associated with the He I lines traced distinct q-u loops with a dramatic rotation away from the dominant axis, indicating that the early-time ejecta were also characterized by hot, fast, helium-rich material concentrated near the poles. At day 295, during the transition to the nebular phase, a new, highly elongated structure became prominent in the ejecta, with an axis orthogonal to the dominant axis that defined the photospheric phase.

They follow a tight scaling relation of X-ray luminosity with halo mass. However, predicting the dependence of the scatter in this relation on mass and redshift is challenging, due to the statistical requirement of large simulation volumes. Using the large volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for galaxy cluster physics FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, we fit this relation and its scatter, focusing on $M_{\rm 500c}>10^{13}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $z \leq 2$. We find qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different results for the two models. For the first time, we study ways to reduce the scatter using properties beyond X-ray luminosity, namely six ICM, six galaxy, and eleven dark matter halo properties. For both FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, the gas fraction and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal correlate strongest with X-ray scatter, reducing it by over 50% when accounting for their partial correlations. Galaxy and halo properties correlate weakly with X-ray scatter, typically reducing it by 10-20%. Our results are qualitatively robust across different FLAMINGO feedback variations, though the correlations weaken for stronger feedback and with increasing redshift. Differences between FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster are only apparent at the high-mass end - where e.g. the galaxy stellar age correlates strongly for FLAMINGO, but not for TNG300+TNG-Cluster - confirming robustness across physics implementations. We provide fitting formulas for the scatter and its corrections, for direct application to cosmological analyses and observational data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09648v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fractional Dynamics in Galactic Nuclei: Non-Local Transport, Transient Phenomena and the Nullification of the Schwarzschild Barrier <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pau Amaro Seoane<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We demonstrate the necessity of fractional calculus for modeling anomalous diffusion in stellar dynamics, specifically Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard transport theories rely on the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, a formalism restricted to Gaussian processes governed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This approach fails for RR, which is a superdiffusive Lévy flight characterized by non-local transport and governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local Riemann-Liouville operators, to resolve major discrepancies between local theory and observations. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts an immediate, linear flux ($Γ(t) \propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict an unphysical exponential delay ($Γ(t) \propto \exp(-C/t)$). Furthermore, we prove mathematically that the non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping''. This mechanism nullifies transport bottlenecks like the proposed Schwarzschild Barrier (SB). Local models incorrectly interpret the SB as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We validate our theoretical findings using direct-summation $N$-body simulations incorporating relativistic corrections. The simulations confirm that particle flux remains continuous across the SB in the regime where RR dominates, demonstrating that the barrier does not inhibit EMRI production. The fractional framework provides the correct physical description for non-local transport, resolving long-standing problems concerning TDE and EMRI rates.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09644v1" target="_blank"><h2>statmorph-lsst: Quantifying and correcting morphological biases in galaxy surveys <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elizaveta Sazonova, Cameron R.

However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index $n$, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements ($A$, $A_S$, $D$) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in $C$ observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry $A_X$ and substructure $St$ - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09641v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chandra and HST Observations of Radio-Selected (Wandering) Massive Black Hole Candidates in Dwarf Galaxies <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Megan R.

Our multi-wavelength analysis indicates a heterogeneous sample with five radio sources detected at both X-ray and optical wavelengths within positional uncertainties and non-detections for the remaining objects. Of the radio objects detected in the X-ray/optical, three have multi-wavelength evidence for hosting nuclear massive BHs and one object is consistent with an extreme compact starburst. Only one of the off-nuclear radio sources has a significant optical counterpart and we present Palomar spectroscopy that identifies this object as a background AGN. We cannot definitively determine if the seven remaining off-nuclear radio sources are wandering massive BHs in the target dwarf galaxies or background AGNs, although the three sources with the largest offsets have compact radio cores detected with the Very Large Baseline Array and are consistent with expectations for background AGNs (Sargent et al 2022). Our HST sensitivity limits also allow for wandering massive BHs in the target dwarf galaxies that are hosted by stellar clusters with masses $\lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09640v1" target="_blank"><h2>The SEEDZ Simulations: Methodology and First Results on Massive Black Hole Seeding and Early Galaxy Growth <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lewis R.

SEEDZ includes models for Population III star formation, supernovae explosions and the resulting formation of light seed black holes, metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, heavy seed black hole formation, Eddington and super-Eddington accretion schemes as well as black hole feedback. In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at $z=15$. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at $z = 0$ (especially the M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of $\sim$10$^4$ M$_\odot$ up to 10$^6$ M$_\odot$. At the high end of our MBH masses, our simulated galaxy M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations match the observed high redshift trends i.e. over-massive BHs with M$_{\rm BH}$/M$_{\rm star} \sim 10^{-2}$. This initial set of simulations will continue to run down to $z=10$, where we will perform a comprehensive comparison of simulated MBH number densities and M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations with JWST observations. Further simulations with higher resolution will then follow.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09637v2" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: II.

In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09630v2" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I.

In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09626v1" target="_blank"><h2>Changing-Look AGN Powered By Disk Tearing <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nicholas Kaaz, Matthew Liska, Charlotte Ward, Jordy Davelaar<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 9 figures, to be submitted to ApJ.

Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\,M_\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09618v1" target="_blank"><h2>Think inside the box: cosmic variance and large-scale conformity of high-redshift massive galaxies in the FLAMINGO simulations <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Seunghwan Lim, Sandro Tacchella, Roberto Maiolino, Christopher C.

FLAMINGO combines a $(1\,\mathrm{cGpc})^3$ volume with baryonic resolution sufficient to identify ${\gtrsim}\,10^3$ independent JWST-like survey volumes of $(100\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$, providing unprecedented statistics to characterize the extremes of cosmic variance. At $z\,{\simeq}\,6$, the total variance in the number of haloes with $M_{200}\,{\simeq}\,10^{11.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (or $M_\ast\,{\simeq}\,10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) is 2--3 times the Poisson expectation, while this ratio decreases with redshift. Similarly, at $z\,{\gtrsim}\,4$, the variance in the most massive halo per JWST-like field is twice the Poisson prediction. We find a pronounced large-scale \emph{conformity}: in volumes ranked by the stellar mass of their most massive galaxy ($M_{\ast,\mathrm{max}}$), the stellar-to-halo mass relation and star-formation efficiency are coherently elevated or suppressed throughout the full $(100\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume. When accounting for galaxies outside the volume, this signal persists only to radii $\lesssim 50\,\mathrm{cMpc}$, demonstrating that the detectable conformity is enhanced by the survey footprint. Moreover, $M_{\ast,\mathrm{max}}$ is a better predictor of the volume-wide efficiency of massive galaxies than the total number counts, which mainly trace clustering. Finally, the stellar fraction of the most massive galaxies peaks at $f_\ast\,{=}\,M_\ast\,/\,(M_{200}f_{\rm b,cosmic})\,{\simeq}\,0.2$ at $z\,{\simeq}\,5$, with a narrower dispersion in $f_\ast$ at fixed redshift and stronger redshift evolution than commonly assumed. These results show that both cosmic variance and footprint-confined conformity must be modelled when interpreting early massive galaxy populations in JWST fields.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09544v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mitigating Nonlinear Systematics in Weak Lensing Surveys II: Stability and Diagnostics with Intrinsic Alignment <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shiming Gu, Ludovic van Waerbeke, Francis Bernardeau, Sebastien Fabbro<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 9 plots, comments welcome!<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform provides a powerful framework for analysing tomographic cosmic shear data by improving the localization of shear correlations in physical scale. It operates by performing a linear combination of the shear data vector in $\ell$-space, yielding a transformed vector that is better localized in both redshift and $k$-space. BNT is particularly useful for estimating cosmological parameters while minimizing the impact of poorly understood nonlinear physics, without discarding large amounts of information as is typically done with simple scale cuts. In our previous work, we showed that BNT outperforms traditional weak-lensing analyses; however, that study did not include intrinsic alignments (IA). In the present work, we assess the robustness of our BNT-based $k$-cut framework in the presence of realistic IA models. We consider two cases: (i) when the assumed IA model used in sampling is close to, but not identical to, the true one, and (ii) when the assumed IA model is significantly mis-specified. In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. In the second, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in the assumed IA model across $k$- and redshift-space, indicating that the corresponding cosmological constraints cannot be trusted until a more accurate IA model is adopted.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09518v1" target="_blank"><h2>Warped Disk Galaxies: Statistical Properties from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yiheng Wang, Han Qu, Jiafeng Lu, Huiyuan Wang, Enci Wang, Xi Kang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted.

We present a systematic study of warped edge-on disk galaxies based on imaging data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8, with the expectation that this large sample size, enabled by wide-area surveys, will offer new perspectives on the formation of disk warps. Using a deep learning approach, we trained an EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network to classify the morphology of edge-on-disk galaxies into warped and non-warped categories. Our model was trained on a curated and visually verified set of labeled galaxy images and applied to a large dataset of over 595,651 edge-on disk galaxies selected from the Galaxy Zoo DESI catalog. Our results provide the largest warp catalog to date, consisting of 23996 warped edge-on disk galaxies, and reveal statistical trends between warp occurrence and galaxy properties. Compared to their non-warped counterparts, these warped disk galaxies tend to have bluer colors, lower stellar masses, higher gas fractions and star-formation rates, smaller Sérsic indices and larger disk sizes. In addition, warped disk galaxies show higher projected number densities of neighboring galaxies than their non-warped counterparts, particularly within \( R_{\mathrm{proj}} \lesssim 50~\mathrm{kpc} \), where the local number density is roughly twice as high.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09503v2" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Time-Dependent Physics with Phase-Folding CMB Maps <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yilun Guan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 7 figures, comments are welcomed, minor text correction<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Time-resolved observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer a powerful probe of time-dependent cosmological signals, such as a stochastic gravitational wave background passing through Earth, which imprints a time-varying deflection on the CMB, and time-dependent cosmic birefringence, which induces an oscillating polarization rotation. However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09499v1" target="_blank"><h2>A ring-shaped starburst as a galactic wind-generating mechanism: Morphology, emission, and mass ejection <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

Numerical or analytical models generally consider that the mass, momentum, and energy injections result from bursts in a nuclear star formation region. However, star formation bursts have recently been observed in ring-like regions in the nuclear part of the galaxies. One example is NGC 253, which has shown a central toroidal burst and an asymmetric galactic wind observed in thermal X-ray emission. The general aim of this work is to study the effect of mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and supernova explosions in star-forming bursts distributed in rings around the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 253. Additionally, these partial objectives allow us to analyze the asymmetry of the outflows due to the bursts position as well as to study the formation of filaments with optical emission and make comparisons with recent observations of galaxies with these types of star-forming bursts. We used the hydrodynamic code AMRVAC to simulate galactic wind ejection coming from a central ring-like starburst located at different vertical positions. We showed that including a ring-shaped starburst (RSS) generates a more complex structured wind than what would be expected for a spherical starburst injection. Besides the interaction between the wind generated by the RSS and the host galaxy, it can generate dense filamentary structures with H alpha emission. The mass flux analysis of our models shows that the variation in the vertical position of the starburst can generate a variation in the mass flux of each lobe of the wind up to an order of magnitude. However, this difference is sustained only for a short period, with the flux tending to be symmetrical once it enters into a free-wind solution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09473v2" target="_blank"><h2>TIME Commissioning Observations: I.

The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region.

In this paper, we study the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy (HDE). To perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis, we select six representative theoretical models from all four categories of HDE. For the observational data, we adopt the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), a collection of alternative BAO data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from the $Planck$ 2018, the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 compilations. We find that HDE models that employ the Hubble scale or its combinations as the IR cutoff cannot alleviate the Hubble tension problem. In contrast, HDE models that employ the future event horizon as the IR cutoff can significantly alleviate the Hubble tension problem. It must be stressed that these two key conclusions hold true for cases of adopting different theoretical HDE models and different observational data. Our findings advocate for further exploration of HDE models using other types of cosmological observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09466v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unbiased analysis of primordial non-Gaussianity: the multipoles of the full relativistic power spectrum <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chris Addis, Sêcloka L.

General relativistic effects have been shown to be degenerate with this measurement, therefore requiring a non-Newtonian approach. In this work, we develop a consistent framework to compute integrated effects, including lensing convergence, time delay, and integrated Sachs--Wolfe, along with the local relativistic projection and wide-separation corrections in the multipoles of the power spectrum. We show that, for a \textit{Euclid}-like H$α$-line galaxy survey and a MegaMapper-like Lyman-break galaxy survey, ignoring these effects leads to a bias on the best fit measurement of the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, of around $ 3\,σ$ and $ 20 \, σ$ respectively. When we include these corrections, the uncertainty in our knowledge of the luminosity function leads to further uncertainty in our measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$. In this work, we show that this degeneracy can be partly mitigated by using a bright-faint multi-tracer analysis, where the observed galaxy sample is subdivided into two separate populations based on luminosity, which provides a $15$--$20\%$ improvement on the forecasted constraints of local type $f_{\rm NL}$. In addition, we present a novel calculation of the full multi-tracer covariance with the inclusion of wide-separation corrections~-- all of these results are implemented in the \textit{Python} code \textsc{CosmoWAP}.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09419v2" target="_blank"><h2>POLAR-2 -- Latest Developments of the Next Generation GRB Polarimeter <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Johannes Hulsman, Philipp Azzarello, Joerg Bayer, Franck Cadoux, Mariachiara Celato, Nicolas De Angelis, Yannick Favre, Aaron Feder, Jochen Greiner, Alejandro Guzman, Coralie Husi, Vishal Kumar, Hancheng Li, Mobin Mobaseri, Gabriel Pelleriti, Agnieszka Pollo, Nicolas Produit, Dominik Rybka, Andrea Santangelo, Jianchao Sun, Chris Tenzer, Xin Wu, Shuang-Nan Zhang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027. Currently, POLAR-2 is in its production phase with the first module targets being produced. We will provide an overview of the current status of the development.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09406v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bright Cosmic-Ray Source as a Solution to Auger-TA Tensions <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alexander Korochkin, Dmitri Semikoz, Peter Tinyakov<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) spectra measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA) agree very well below $10^{19.5}$ eV but differ significantly at higher energies. We show that these differences can be explained by a single nearby source superimposed on a nearly isotropic background. Taking into account deflections in Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, such a source can account for the excess in the TA spectrum without producing excessive anisotropy. The required hard spectrum of the source and intermediate-mass composition are consistent with previous fits of the Auger-only spectrum and composition. This scenario offers several additional advantages: (i) the source produces a broad excess partially overlapping the TA hotspots, suggesting their possible explanation; (ii) without additional tuning, it reproduces the $\sim90^\circ$ shift in dipole direction observed between the Auger-only and combined Auger-TA analyses; and (iii) the best-fit position of the source lies near M82, the brightest nearby starburst galaxy, making it a plausible source of the UHECR.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09364v1" target="_blank"><h2>Recombination Clumping Factor of Physically Defined Intergalactic Medium at the Epoch of Reionization <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuri Oku, Renyue Cen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> feedback (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), IGM (abstract), intergalactic medium (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The recombination clumping factor, $C$, is a key parameter in modeling cosmic reionization, but its value is sensitive to the definition of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We investigate the clumping factor using the GAMER adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulation code. We introduce a new, physically-motivated definition of the IGM based on the effective transmission factor of ionizing photons. We perform large-scale, full-box simulations with varying intensities of the uniform ultraviolet background, and we find that our physically-defined clumping factor is significantly lower than the values derived from traditional overdensity thresholds. We also introduce an analytic model that distinguishes between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted averages of the neutral fraction, and we find the difference in reionization timing of $Δz \sim 2$ depending on the assumed clumping factor and the relation between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted neutral fractions. Our zoom-in simulations further show that, while SN feedback increases the clumping factor locally, the effect is limited to $\sim 100$ kpc scales and does not significantly alter the global clumping factor. The substantially lower clumping factor reduces the required ionizing photon budget, potentially alleviating tension for reionization scenarios driven by rare, bright sources like active galactic nuclei.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09311v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Unified Dark-Matter--Driven Relativistic Bondi Route to Black-Hole Growth from Stellar to Supermassive Scales <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chian-Shu Chen, Feng-Li Lin<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7, pages, 5 figures with additional supplementary material<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of luminous quasars at $z\gtrsim7$ reveal supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with inferred masses $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^9 \, M_\odot$ formed within the first $\sim700$~Myr of cosmic history. Standard growth channels \textrm{ -- } Eddington-limited gas accretion and hierarchical mergers \textrm{ -- } face severe timescale restrictions. We consider a super-Eddington accretion mechanism aided by the Bondi accretion of a minimal model of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We demonstrate that in a {\it critical regime} with a near-relativistic sound speed, the Bondi accretion yields an accretion rate that depends only on the mass $m$ of SIDM, thus it is universal to the ambient environment. This critical accretion mechanism for $m\gtrsim 10^{-2}\; {\rm eV}$ can grow seeds as small as $10\,M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBH) in the early Universe into $10^9$ \textrm{--} $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ SMBHs by $z\sim7$ without fine-tuned environments. Therefore, given a mass distribution of PBHs and a value of $m$, the mass function of primary black holes at late time can be fully determined with masses ranging from stellar to SMBHs. This connects the microscopic physics of dark matter to astrophysical observations of black holes.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09304v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variability of optical spectral index to support a central sub-parsec binary black hole system in quasar SDSS J001224-102226.51 <span style="color: #45ABC2; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold;">[NEW]</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhang XueGuang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted to be published in A&A Letters<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-12<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title, abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), quasar (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this manuscript, variations in optical spectral index $α_{5100}$ are applied for detecting central sub-parsec binary black hole systems (sub-pc BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN), due to apparent effects of obscurations on central two BH accreting systems. For sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN, two main characteristics on $α_{5100}$ can be expected. First, if a BLAGN harbours a central sub-pc BBH, the expected unique variability in $α_{5100}$ should lead the BLAGN to be an outlier in the space of $α_{5100}$ versus continuum luminosity $L_{5100}$ determined from normal BLAGN. Second, BLAGN harbouring central sub-pc BBHs could lead to periodic variations in $α_{5100}$. Here, after checking the two-epoch SDSS spectra of quasar SDSS J0012-1022 reported as a candidate of sub-pc BBH by large velocity offset between narrow and broad Balmer emission lines, unique variability of $α_{5100}$ can be explained by effects of obscurations related to an assumed central sub-pc BBH. In the near future, to detect and report periodic variations of $α_{5100}$ for sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN should be our main objective. The results provide a new method by applications of properties of optical continuum emissions for detecting sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 266 papers (264 new, 2 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
