  Energy Model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shubham Barua, Shantanu Desai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 24 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy
(DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with
supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential
(EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We
determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for
three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four
neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted)
and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus,
CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with
physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our
results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We
further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly
sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter
than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the
datasets used and the cosmological model play a crucial role in the inferred
cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE
parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for
nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16455v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ultralight dark matter from non-slowroll inflation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Martina La Rosa, Gianmassimo Tasinato</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 4 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The longitudinal mode of a massive vector field, generated during inflation,
offers a well-motivated and phenomenologically rich candidate for dark matter.
We show that a rapid variation in the mass of the vector boson, occurring
during a brief phase of non-slowroll inflationary evolution, can naturally give
rise to extremely small vector masses after inflation ends, corresponding to an
ultralight dark matter candidate. This mechanism predicts a stochastic
gravitational-wave background, generated at second order by non-adiabatic
longitudinal vector fluctuations and amplified at very low frequencies,
yielding a distinctive observational signature of the scenario. By leveraging a
brief departure from slowroll dynamics during inflation - commonly invoked in
scenarios that produce primordial black holes - our framework establishes a
novel connection between ultralight vector dark matter and primordial black
hole physics, suggesting a possible unified setting for mixed dark matter
scenarios.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15134v2" target="_blank"><h2>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models
  and $ΔN_{eff}$ Bounds</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ido Ben-Dayan, Utkarsh Kumar, Amresh Verma</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 3 figures, and 3 tables. Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave
background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by
NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB
measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective
number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of
Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA)
spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB
limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension
with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that
current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible
contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future
CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities
reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that
Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic
strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $>3.5\sigma$ detection
by the Simons Observatory.</p></br></body>
