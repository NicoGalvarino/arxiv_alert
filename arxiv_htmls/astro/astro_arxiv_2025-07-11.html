  High-Redshift Neutral Outflows</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lorenzo Moretti, Sirio Belli, Gwen C. Rudie, Andrew B. Newman, Minjung Park, Amir H.

blueshifted absorption in Na I D and other resonant absorption lines,
indicative of strong gas outflows in the neutral phase. However, the measured
mass outflow rates are highly uncertain because JWST observations can only
probe the column density of trace elements such as sodium, while most of the
gas is in the form of hydrogen. The conversion between the column density of
sodium and that of hydrogen is based on observations of gas clouds within the
Milky Way, and has not been directly tested for massive galaxies at high
redshift. In order to test this conversion, we study a unique system consisting
of a massive quiescent galaxy (J1439B) at z = 2.4189 located at a projected
distance of 38 physical kpc from the bright background quasar QSO J1439. The
neutral outflow from the galaxy is observed as a sub-damped Lyman-alpha
absorber in the spectrum of the background quasar, which enables a direct
measurement of the hydrogen column density from Lyman transitions. We obtain
new near-infrared spectroscopy with Magellan/FIRE and detect Na I D and other
resonant absorption lines from Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. We are thus able to
derive new, empirical calibrations between the column density of trace elements
and the hydrogen column density, that can be used to estimate the mass and the
rate of neutral gas outflows in other massive quiescent galaxies at high
redshift. The calibration we derive for Na I is only 30% lower than the local
relation that is typically assumed at high redshift, confirming that the
neutral outflows observed with JWST at z > 2 are able to remove a large amount
of gas and are thus likely to play a key role in galaxy quenching. However,
using the local calibration for Mg II yields an order-of-magnitude discrepancy
compared to the empirical calibration, possibly because of variations in the
dust depletion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07171v1" target="_blank"><h2>Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Borui Zhang, Wei-Xiang Feng, Haipeng An</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, gr-qc, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 3 figures, plus supplemental material (2 figures)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of
compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little
red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of
$10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a
mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed
through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo
sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic
microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway
mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski
coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting
stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this
process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to
the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain
the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active
galactic nuclei.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07404v1" target="_blank"><h2>The z=1.03 Merging Cluster SPT-CL J0356-5337: New Strong Lensing
  Analysis with HST and MUSE</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Grace Smith, Guillaume Mahler, Kate Napier, Keren Sharon, Matthew Bayliss, Bradford Benson, Lindsey Bleem, Benjamin Floyd, Vittorio Ghirardini, Michael D.

SPT-CL J0356-5337, a galaxy cluster at redshift z = 1.034. Our model supersedes
previous models by making use of new multi-band HST data and MUSE spectroscopy.
We identify two additional lensed galaxies to inform a more well-constrained
model using 12 sets of multiple images in 5 separate lensed sources. The three
previously-known sources were spectroscopically confirmed by Mahler et al.
(2020) at redshifts of z = 2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048. We measured the
spectroscopic redshifts of two of the newly-discovered arcs using MUSE data, at
z = 3.0205 and z = 5.3288. We increase the number of cluster member galaxies by
a factor of three compared to previous work. We also report the detection of
extended Lya emission from several background galaxies. We measure the total
projected mass density of the two major sub-cluster components, one dominated
by the BCG, and the other by a compact group of luminous red galaxies. We find
M_BCG(< 80kpc) = 3.93+0.21-0.14 * 10^13Msun and M_LRG(< 80kpc) = 2.92+0.16
-0.23 * 10^13Msun, yielding a mass ratio of 1.35+0.16 -0.08. The strong lensing
constraints offer a robust estimate of the projected mass density regardless of
modelling assumptions; allowing more substructure in this line of sight does
not change the results or conclusions. Our results corroborate the conclusion
that SPT-CL J0356-5337 is dominated by two mass components, and is likely
undergoing a major merger on the plane of the sky</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07552v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detecting Galactic Rings in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys with
  Semi-Supervised Deep Learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jianzhen Chen, Zhijian Luo, Cheng Cheng, Jun Hou, Shaohua Zhang, Chenggang Shu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 9 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract), ISM (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The ring structures of disk galaxies are vital for understanding galaxy
evolution and dynamics. However, due to the scarcity of ringed galaxies and
challenges in their identification, traditional methods often struggle to
efficiently obtain statistically significant samples. To address this, this
study employs a novel semi-supervised deep learning model, GC-SWGAN, aimed at
identifying galaxy rings from high-resolution images of the DESI Legacy Imaging
Surveys. We selected over 5,000 confirmed ringed galaxies from the Catalog of
Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) and the Northern Ringed Galaxies from the GZ2
catalog (GZ2-CNRG), both verified by morphology expert R. J. Buta, to create an
annotated training set. Additionally, we incorporated strictly selected
non-ringed galaxy samples from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and utilized unlabelled
data from DESI Legacy Surveys to train our model. Through semi-supervised
learning, the model significantly reduced reliance on extensive annotated data
while enhancing robustness and generalization. On the test set, it demonstrated
exceptional performance in identifying ringed galaxies. With a probability
threshold of 0.5, the classification accuracy reached 97\%, with precision and
recall for ringed galaxies at 94\% and 93\%, respectively. Building on these
results, we predicted 750,000 galaxy images from the DESI Legacy Imaging
Surveys with r-band apparent magnitudes less than 17.0 and redshifts in the
range 0.0005 < z < 0.25, compiling the largest catalog of ringed galaxies to
date, containing 62,962 galaxies with ring structures. This catalog provides
essential data for subsequent research on the formation mechanisms and
evolutionary history of galaxy rings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07190v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Balmer Break and Optical Continuum of Little Red Dots From
  Super-Eddington Accretion</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hanpu Liu, Yan-Fei Jiang, Eliot Quataert, Jenny E. Greene, Yilun Ma</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The physical origin of Little Red Dots (LRDs)--compact extragalactic sources
with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines--remains elusive. The
redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at
a characteristic effective temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Meanwhile, many
LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense
gas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and
radiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion
system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously,
without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The
break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit,
similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of
super-Eddington systems, $\rho<10^{-9}{\rm~g~cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant
opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$.
Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine
tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a
geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective
temperature $4000{\rm~K}\lesssim T_{\rm eff}\lesssim6000{\rm~K}$ that is very
insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar
models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer
break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss predictions of our
model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super-Eddington
accretion simulations.</p></br></body>
