Cosmological density
  and properties of the missing baryons</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Massimiliano Bonamente, David Spence, Jussi Ahoranta, Nastasha Wijers, Toni Tuominen, Jelle De Plaa</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> MNRAS in press</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), baryon density (abstract), quasar (title), intergalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This paper presents constraints on the cosmological density of baryons from a
systematic search for O VII and O VIII absorption lines in the XMM-Newton and
Chandra X-ray spectra of 51 background sources. The search is based on far
ultra-violet redshift priors from HST and FUSE, and it has resulted in the
identification of 34 possible O VII and O VIII absorption-line systems at the
99% confidence level, out of a search in 1,224 systems with fixed redshift
priors. Of these, 7 O VII and 8 O VIII systems pass additional screening
criteria and are deemed to be associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM). We find that the cosmological baryon density associated with these
possible detections is consistent with the value required to solve the missing
baryons problem. Specifically, we find that $\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\Omega_b =
0.83\pm^{3.99}_{0.62}$ from the O VII lines, at the 68% level of confidence
(assuming 20% Solar abundances and 100% ionization fraction), or separately
$\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\Omega_b = 0.79\pm^{3.08}_{0.50}$ from the O VIII lines
(assuming 20% Solar abundances 50% ionization fraction). We also conducted an
extensive analysis of systematic errors affecting these estimates, and provided
evidence of the association between the detected X-ray absorption line systems
with known filaments of SDSS galaxies. The results of this analysis therefore
contributes to the characterization of the missing baryons and it indicates
that they are in fact associated with the high-temperature portion of the
warm-hot intergalactic medium, and possibly with large-scale WHIM filaments
traced by galaxies, as consistently predicted by numerical simulations and by
other independent probes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21409v1" target="_blank"><h2>Explaining the "too massive" high-redshift galaxies in JWST data:
  numerical study of three effects and a simple relation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Joshua J. Ziegler, Katherine Freese, Jonathan Lozano, Gabriele Montefalcone</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 3 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that
appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the
Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe
is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail
the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations
for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the
stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially
decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial
metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given
luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they
actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code,
and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency
relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star
formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as
$M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass
could be lower by a factor of $\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our
examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with
slope $\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the
numerical results, $\epsilon(\alpha) \approx \epsilon_{\rm fid}e^{2.66(\alpha
-2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these
effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies
compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may
explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST:
the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently
high mass galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21973v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating quasar microlensing light curves: High magnification events</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Favio Neira, Timo Anguita, Georgios Vernardos</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 12 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Quasar microlensing can be used to constrain important astrophysical
properties, such as the accretion disk size and the amount of stars in the
lensing galaxy. The associated brightness variations over time, in particular
high magnification events (HMEs) and caustic crossings, can yield precise
constraints due to their strong dependence on the relative projected velocities
of the components and accretion disk size. The next generation of large sky
area surveys, such as The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) and Euclid, are
expected to find and follow-up thousands of lensed quasars from which such
events could be identified and observed. In this work we present a
characterization and estimation of all HMEs that could potentially be observed,
focusing on systems that could be identified by ground based telescopes. From
systems whose minimum image separation is at least 1 arcsec, and their second
dimmest image is at least 21.5 magnitudes in the i-band ($\sim560$ in the
southern or northern sky), we estimate $\sim60$ HMEs with amplitudes $>0.3$
[mag] in the r-band per year. We find that on average, saddle images are
approximately four times more likely to host events than minima, and $\sim10\%$
($\sim50\%$) of events are caustic crossings for saddles (minima). We also find
that HMEs in saddle images can have amplitudes $\sim1-2$ [mag] larger than
minima.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21838v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio Variability in Recently-Quenched Galaxies: The Impact of TDE or

emission that can be used to study the impact of accretion energy on the host
galaxy. The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us
to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we
present the results of a targeted VLA program observing four post-starburst
galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past ~20
years. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for
each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of
self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen
significantly over the past ~20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear
recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical
peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low
luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by
tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of
the accreted material, these newly-launched outflows contain sufficient energy
to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and to
drive turbulence suppressing star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22014v1" target="_blank"><h2>Little Red Dots as self-gravitating discs accreting on supermassive
  stars: Spectral appearance and formation pathway of the progenitors to direct
  collapse black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lorenz Zwick, Christopher Tiede, Lucio Mayer</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages + Appendix; Four figures and two tables</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose an alternative physical interpretation and formation pathway for
the recently discovered "little red dots" (LRDs). We model LRDs as
super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion
discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The
model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where
the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line
broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN,
stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results
in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are
robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two
representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior
distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius
relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion
in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$
M$_{\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that
squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the
model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with
observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dwarf galaxies in non-local gravity</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ivan De Martino, Riccardo Della Monica, Mahmood Roshan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 5 figures. Accepted on PDU</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing open questions in
modern cosmology. Despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct or indirect
detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed. This has motivated
alternative approaches, including modifications to the underlying theory of
gravity. In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local
gravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing
non-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We
analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and
Ursa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model
the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our
analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the
observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter,
providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are
compatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter
inconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires
further attention.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21249v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quenching Through Tidal Gas Removal: Molecular Gas and Star Formation in

preventing the growth of overly massive systems and explaining the formation of
present-day elliptical galaxies. We present a high-resolution,
spatially-resolved multiwavelength study of two z ~ 0.7 massive post-starburst
galaxies, SDSS J1448+1010 and SDSS J2258+2313, from the SQuIGGLE survey
(Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, anguLar momentum, and
Evolution), providing new insights into the role of mergers in driving
quenching. ALMA CO(2-1) observations show that both galaxies removed ~50% of
their molecular gas into extended tidal tails, spanning up to 65 kpc, following
recent mergers. HST WFC3 imaging and grism spectroscopy show that while SDSS
J1448+1010 exhibits Halpha emission in its northern tidal tail consistent with
ongoing star formation, SDSS J2258+2313 lacks detectable star-forming activity
outside the central galaxy. VLA 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio
emission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets
indicative of AGN activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas
reservoirs in their central regions that appear more turbulent than 'normal'
star-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation
rates in the hosts. Despite similarities in their cold gas content and tidal
features the galaxies are distinct from each other in their star formation,
gas-star alignment, and radio morphology, highlighting the complexity of tidal
gas removal as a quenching mechanism at intermediate redshifts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21764v1" target="_blank"><h2>Ultraviolet photon production rates of the first stars: Impact on the He

important role in heating the intergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic
dawn. The very high effective temperatures ($\sim 10^5$ K) predicted for the
most massive Population III stars could also give rise to tell-tale signatures
in the emission-line spectra of early star clusters or small galaxies dominated
by such stars. Important quantities in modelling their observational signatures
include their photon production rates at ultraviolet energies at which photons
are able to ionize hydrogen and helium, dissociate molecular hydrogen and cause
Lyman-$\alpha$ heating. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of
Population III stars to explore how these key quantities are affected by the
initial mass and rotation of Population III stars given a wide range of models
for the evolution of these stars. Our results indicate that rotating Population
III stars that evolve to effective temperatures $\sim 2\times 10^5$ K could
potentially give rise to a very strong HeII 1640 emission line in the spectra
from primordial star clusters, without requiring stellar masses of $\gtrsim
100\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ indicated by previous models for non-rotating Population
III stars. At the same time, the observable impact on 21-cm signatures from
cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization from our set of rotating stars that
evolve to $\sim 2\times 10^5$ K are modest, and produce potentially detectable
features in the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum for high
Population III star formation efficiencies only.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21632v1" target="_blank"><h2>Optical Emission-Line Properties of eROSITA-selected SDSS-V Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nadiia G.

sample of 3684 galaxies (0.002 < z < 0.55), drawn from the eRASS1 catalog. We
modeled SDSS-V DR19 spectra using the NBursts full spectrum fitting technique
with E-MILES simple stellar populations (SSP) models and emission line
templates to decompose broad and narrow emission line components for
correlation with X-ray properties. We place the galaxies on the
Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram to diagnose their dominant excitation
mechanism. We show that the consistent use of the narrow component fluxes
shifts most galaxies systematically and significantly upward to the active
galactic nuclei (AGN) region on the BPT diagram. On this basis, we confirm the
dependence between a galaxys position on the BPT diagram and its (0.2-2.3 keV)
X-ray/H$\alpha$ flux ratio. We also verified the correlation between X-ray
luminosity and emission line luminosities of the narrow [O\iii]$\lambda 5007$

Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) mass, the X-ray luminosity, and the velocity
dispersion of the stellar component ($\sigma_{*}$) on the base on the unique

These results highlight the importance of emission line decomposition in AGN

  signal?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alexandra Nelander, Christopher Cain, Jordan C J DSilva, Peter H Sims, Rogier A Windhorst, Judd D Bowman</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 9 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract), high redshift (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Signal
(EDGES) has reported evidence for an absorption feature in the sky-averaged
radio background near 78 MHz. A cosmological interpretation of this signal
corresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \sim 17$.
The large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio
background above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM.
Here, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is
back-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud
AGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of
UV-bright objects observed at $z > 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough
radio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$
UV-bright objects down to $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and
that the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude
between $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping
these objects must be $\lesssim 1\%$ of their expected intrinsic production
rate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM
pre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its
flat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light
produced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift
dependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although
physically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical
properties required for them to do so.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21512v1" target="_blank"><h2>SDSS-IV MaNGA: Physical Origins of Double-Peaked Narrow Emission-Line

In this study, we examine two potential scenarios: the gas inflow along the bar
and the formation of a bar-induced gaseous nuclear ring. By applying a
classical galactic dynamics model, we calculate the radii and rotational
velocities of the nuclear rings for all barred DPGs, and compare them with the
observed properties of their DPSs. Our analysis reveals a significant
correlation between the predicted radii of the nuclear rings and the maximum
centric distances of the DPSs, as well as a marginal correlation between the
predicted rotational velocities of the nuclear rings and the observed maximum
velocity differences of the DPSs. These findings provide strong evidence to
support the hypothesis that the DPSs of a barred DPG in MaNGA primarily
originate from the convolution of the PSF effect with its bar-induced
fast-rotating gaseous nuclear ring.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21852v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Lyman-$α$ Forest from LBGs: First 3D Correlation Measurement

Here, we explore the viability Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as alternative
background sources for Ly$\alpha$ forest studies. We analyze 4,151 Ly$\alpha$
forest skewers extracted from LBG spectra obtained in the DESI pilot surveys in
the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. We present the first measurement of the
Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function derived exclusively from LBG
spectra, probing comoving separations up to 48 $h^{-1}$Mpc at an effective
redshift of $z_\mathrm{eff}$ = 2.70. The measured signal is consistent with
that from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift,
validating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the
cross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy
positions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for
galaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic
LBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over
5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than
our dataset, could enable Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the

full-shape analysis improves the AP constraint to 0.6%. These results open a
