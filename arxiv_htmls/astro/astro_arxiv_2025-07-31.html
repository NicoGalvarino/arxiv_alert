sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms
regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but
so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA
observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z > 11$ galaxy that
bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data
confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance,
precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with
JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu <
9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of
$\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass
of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all
$3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm
0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that
redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even
spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential
damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic
overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity
of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$,
meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs
given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved
MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to
consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star
formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~30% solar), only 400 Myr
after the Big Bang.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22283v1" target="_blank"><h2>MUSEQuBES: The Column Density, Covering Fraction, Mass, and

Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (title, abstract), quasar (abstract), CGM (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate cool HI gas traced by Lyman series absorption in the vicinity
of 256 galaxies (median stellar mass, log10(M*/Msun) = 8.7 and median redshift,
z = 0.48) using 15 background quasars (median impact parameter, D ~ 140
physical kpc (pkpc)), as part of the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey
(MUSEQuBES). We find that the HI column density (N(HI)) profile around
isolated, star-forming galaxies, which span ~ 3 dex in stellar mass, is well
described by a power law with a slope of ~ -2.3 when expressed as a function of
the normalized impact parameter, D/Rvir. The HI covering fraction (k) within
the virial radius, for a threshold of log10(N(HI)/cm^{-2}) = 14, is
significantly lower for high-mass passive galaxies compared to their isolated,
star-forming counterparts. The k-profile of isolated, star-forming galaxies
suggests a characteristic size of the HI-rich CGM of ~ 1.5 Rvir, consistently
across the stellar mass range. The mean HI mass in the outer CGM (0.3-1 Rvir )
increases with stellar mass, ranging from ~ 10^{5} to 10^{6.6} Msun. The
b-parameters of the strongest HI components correlate and anti-correlate with
specific star-formation rate (sSFR) and mass, respectively, with > 2 sigma
significance. Broad Lya absorbers (BLAs) with b > 60 km s^{-1} are
predominantly associated with high-mass galaxies, likely tracing the warm-hot
phase of the CGM. The velocity centroids of HI components indicate that the
absorbers at D < Rvir are predominantly consistent with being gravitationally
bound to their associated galaxy, regardless of stellar mass. Finally,
leveraging ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the wide-field
Magellan follow-up of six MUSEQuBES fields, we find that non-isolated galaxies
exhibit an HI-rich environment that extends approximately three times further
than for their isolated counterparts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22826v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extended multi-phase gas reservoirs in the z=4.3 protocluster

z=4.3, known to host one of the most starbursting and AGN-rich high redshift
environments.For this purpose we conducted APEX single dish observations of the
[CII]158 micron (hereafter [CII]) line towards the Core and North components,
previously imaged with the ALMA 12-m array. We also present the first [OIII]88
micron (hereafter [OIII]) line observations in such high redshift protocluster
system. We obtain a [CII] line luminosity $\sim$1.7$\times$ more than the one
recovered by ALMA towards the Core, while remarkably we recover 4$\times$ more
[CII] line emission than the one found in deep ALMA images towards the North
component, suggesting that the most massive gas reservoirs lie in the less
extreme regions of this protocluster system. A minimum ionised gas mass of
$\mathrm M_{\rm min}(H^+)$$ \sim$$3.7\times 10^{10}$\,\Msun\, is deduced from
the [OIII] line, amounting to 30\% of the molecular gas mass in the same area.
Finally we obtain star formation rate (SFR) estimates using the [OIII] line
luminosity, and the corresponding ionised gas mass. These yield values that can
surpass the far-IR continuum-derived SFR (under the assumption of a standard
stellar IMF), which can be reconciled only if non-stellar ionising sources
contribute to the [OIII] line luminosity, or a top-heavy stellar IMF produces a
larger fraction of O stars per total stellar mass, a distinct possibility in
High-Energy-Particle (HEP) rather than (UV-photon)-dominated environments in
clusters. Future work using far-IR fine-structure and molecular/neutral-atomic
lines is necessary for determining the thermal/ionisation states of the
multi-phase medium and these line ratios must be measured over a wide range of
spatial scales, which ultimately requires combining wide-field single-dish and
high resolution interferometric observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22155v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cusp-to-Core Transition of Dark Matter Halos across Galaxy Mass Scales</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kohei Hayashi, Yuka Kaneda, Masao Mori, Michi Shinozaki</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 3 figures, and 2 tables. Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large
sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing
whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform
Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that
allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify
the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner
region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma_{\rm DM}(<0.01r_{V_{\rm max}})$, and
compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy
groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner
density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores,
and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold
dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both
lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the
cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a
cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by
hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling
uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new
empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures
and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22237v1" target="_blank"><h2>CECILIA: Ultra-Deep Rest-Optical Spectra of Faint Galaxies at Cosmic

galaxy formation, tracing low-metallicity, low-mass systems during Cosmic Noon
and serving as analogs to reionization-era galaxies. We present ultra-deep
JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of nine low-luminosity galaxies ($-17 \lesssim M_{\rm
UV} \lesssim -20$, $M_\star \lesssim 10^9\,M_\odot$) at $z\sim2.5$ from the
CECILIA program, with $\sim$29.5 hr in G235M/F170LP and 1 hr in G395M/F290LP.
Our sample includes four LAEs, three rest-UV color-selected galaxies, and two
serendipitous detections -- providing the most sensitive rest-optical spectra
of individual faint galaxies at this epoch to date. Balmer-line measurements
reveal low SFRs ($0.63 < \mathrm{SFR}/(M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < 5.43$) and
a broad range of dust reddening ($0 < E(B-V) < 1$), with SFRs systematically
below those of continuum-selected galaxies. Electron densities are low ($n_e
\lesssim 200$cm$^{-3}$), and emission-line diagnostics indicate low
[NII]/H$\alpha$, high [OIII]/H$\beta$, suggesting metallicities $12+\log({\rm
O/H})\lesssim8.0$. We also present the first O1-BPT constraints in such faint
high-redshift galaxies. Notably, two galaxies show low [OIII]/H$\beta$ despite
high Ly$\alpha$ EWs and very low [NII]/H$\alpha$, consistent with the predicted
turnover in this ratio at very low metallicities -- highlighting the need for
complementary diagnostics (e.g., N2, O32) to identify metal-poor systems.
Direct $T_e$-based abundances and expanded samples are needed to further trace
metallicity and ionization trends in low-mass galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22602v1" target="_blank"><h2>A MaNGA about the Legacy I: Connecting the Assembly of Stellar Halo with

history, and star formation timescales in low-redshift massive early-type
galaxies (ETGs) by combining deep LegacySurvey imaging with MaNGA's spatially
resolved spectroscopy. Focusing on stellar population properties, especially
the [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio, we analyze stacked spectra using both absorption
line indices and full-spectrum fitting. We find that, among massive ETGs with
identical average stellar mass distributions beyond 5 kpc, those with higher
central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{cen}$) are older and more
$\alpha$-enhanced, suggesting a connection between the in-situ star formation
in the past and the central gravitational potential today for massive ETGs with
a similar stellar accretion history. Conversely, at fixed $\sigma_{cen}$ and
total stellar mass, galaxies with more extended stellar halos show lower
[Fe/H], higher [Mg/Fe], and older ages, indicating an intriguing link between
early starburst and quenching and later ex-situ assembly. These results
demonstrate that the evolution of massive galaxies cannot be fully described by
simple scaling relations alone, as the interplay between in-situ star formation
and ex-situ accretion leaves distinct imprints in both their inner and outer
stellar populations. Our findings highlight the importance of extending stellar
population studies to large radii and underscore the scientific potential of
next-generation IFU surveys and deep, high-resolution spectroscopy for probing
the galaxy-halo connection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22102v1" target="_blank"><h2>Measuring the splashback feature: Dependence on halo properties and

$\mathcal{W}$ to examine how the splashback features of dark matter haloes are
affected by the physical properties of haloes themselves. We use the largest
simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in
bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and
concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the
logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results
show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which
follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$.
Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar
dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak
height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the
fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass,
redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and
width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since
they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak
height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's
assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density
profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback
features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass
accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and
width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities
like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the
halo's history and inner structure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22333v1" target="_blank"><h2>Streams and Shells Decoded: A Density-Driven Approach to Stellar

Lewis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> This paper has been accepted for publication in PASA</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract), LLS (title)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel method to differentiate stream-like and shell-like tidal
remnants of stellar systems in galactic halos using the density-based approach
of the clustering algorithm AstroLink. While previous studies lean on
observation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell
determination, we introduce AstroLink's ordered-density plot and cluster
identification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the
AstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical
clustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being
statistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo
disruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures,
we find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for
stream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with
more standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which
structures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories.
Furthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell
samples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of
stellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification
and subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of
investigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure
formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22858v1" target="_blank"><h2>JADES-GS-z14-1: A Compact, Faint Galaxy at $z\approx14$ with Weak Metal

of the Big Bang. While luminous galaxies at $z > 10$ often show significant [O
III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 emission lines, it remains unclear whether such
features are prevalent among fainter, more typical galaxies due to
observational limits. We present deep imaging and spectroscopy of
JADES-GS-z14-1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=13.86^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, currently the
faintest spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z\approx 14$. It
serendipitously received 70.7 hours of MIRI/F770W imaging in the JWST Advanced
Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), the deepest MIRI exposure for any
high-redshift galaxy to date. Nonetheless, we detect only tentative F770W
emission of $7.9\pm2.8$ nJy at $2.8\sigma$ significance, constraining the total
equivalent width of [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 + H$\beta$ to
$520^{+400}_{-380}$ A, weaker than most $z > 10$ galaxies with MIRI detections.
This source is unresolved across 16 NIRCam bands, implying a physical radius
$\lesssim50$ pc. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy totaling 56 hours reveals no
rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines above $3 \sigma$. Stellar population
synthesis suggests a stellar mass $\sim4\times 10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and a
star formation rate $\sim 2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. The absence of strong
metal emission lines despite intense star formation suggests a gas-phase
metallicity below 10% solar and potentially a high escape fraction of ionizing
photons. These deep observations provide rare constraints on faint, early
galaxies, tracing the onset of chemical enrichment and ionization in the early
Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22669v1" target="_blank"><h2>SOAP: A Python Package for Calculating the Properties of Galaxies and

the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In
this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the
accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the
conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo
mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift $z =
10$, a halo with mass $10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ and a spin parameter of $0.02$ can
form a black hole of $1.4 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ through GC migration and
accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black
hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to the fraction
of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a
plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining
our model with halo mass functions and the distribution of spin parameters, we
construct black hole mass functions that successfully reproduce the number
densities of massive BH candidates at $z \sim 5$ inferred from JWST
observations, and UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10$.</p></br></body>
