This motivates cross-correlations, to ascertain the cosmological nature of measured HI fluctuations, and to study their connections with galaxies and the underlying matter density field. However, these same foregrounds render the cross-correlation with projected fields such as the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) difficult. Indeed, the correlated Fourier modes vary slowly along the line of sight, and are thus most contaminated by the smooth-spectrum radio continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we implement a method that avoids this issue by attempting to measure the non-linear gravitational coupling of the small-scale 21cm power from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with large-scale Planck CMB lensing. This measurement is a position-dependent power spectrum, i.e. a squeezed integrated bispectrum. Using 94 nights of CHIME data between $1.0 < z < 1.3$ and aggressive foreground filtering, we find that the expected signal is five times smaller than the current noise. We forecast that incorporating the additional nights of CHIME data already collected would enable a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, without any further improvements in filtering for foreground cleaning.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03140v1" target="_blank"><h2>Large-scale radio bubbles around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Noa Grollimund, Stéphane Corbel, Rob Fender, James H.

Recently, the detection of large-scale very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr and other BH-jet systems suggested that jets from microquasars may play an important role in the production of galactic cosmic rays. V4641 Sgr is known for its superluminal radio jet discovered in 1999, but no radio counterpart of a large-scale jet has been observed. The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism. We suggest that the bow-tie structure arose from the long-term action of large-scale jets or disk winds from V4641 Sgr. If the emission mechanism is of synchrotron origin, the radio/X-ray extended structure implies acceleration of electrons up to more than 100 TeV as far as tens of parsecs from the black hole.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03122v1" target="_blank"><h2>Late-time Background Constraints on Linear and Non-linear Interacting Dark Energy after DESI DR2 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> David Figueruelo, Marcel van der Westhuizen, Amare Abebe, Eleonora Di Valentino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title), high redshift (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In this study, we present observational constraints on a class of phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models that admit analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We consider a set of five linear and three non-linear IDE scenarios, encompassing both interactions proportional to the dark matter and/or dark energy densities, as well as non-linear combinations of the two. For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $Λ$CDM from a $Δχ^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($Δ$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3Hδρ_{\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3Hδρ_{\rm de}$ and $Q=3Hδ\left(\tfrac{ρ_{\rm de}^2}{ρ_{\rm dm}+ρ_{\rm de}}\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}>-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}<-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03028v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bounce Inflation with Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of DESI DR2 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xin-zhe Zhang, Hao-Hao Li, Taotao Qiu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $Λ$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$σ$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \pm 2.1 \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$σ$ confidence of $Λ$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02889v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing ionized bubbles around luminous sources during reionization with SKA 21-cm observations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Arnab Mishra, Kanan Kumar Datta, Chandra Shekhar Murmu, Samir Choudhuri, Iffat Nasreen, Snehasish Saha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Detecting and characterizing individual ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using the redshifted HI 21-cm signal provides a direct probe of the early ionizing sources and the intergalactic medium. We develop and validate a computationally efficient estimator that operates on gridded visibilities to detect ionized bubbles. This serves as an accurate alternative to the more computationally demanding bare estimator that uses all baselines and frequency channels. Further, we employ a non-parametric foreground-subtraction method based on Gaussian process regression, which minimizes loss of the HI 21-cm signal and yields improved signal-to-noise ratios. Our analysis indicates that ionized bubbles at redshifts $z \sim 7 - 8$ can be detected with SNR $\gtrsim 10$ using $\sim 100$ hours of SKA1-Low AA$^*$ and AA4 observations. We further derive a scaling relation that connects the SNR to the bubble radius, redshift, total observing time, and the mean neutral hydrogen fraction of the surrounding IGM. This helps to quickly predict the observational outcome for any planned observations and is, therefore, useful for devising observational strategies. Finally, we apply a Bayesian likelihood framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to the residual visibilities to recover ionized bubble properties, including radius, position, and the mean neutral fraction. The resulting posterior distributions demonstrate accurate recovery of the bubble parameters. This confirms the feasibility of robustly characterizing individual ionized regions with the SKA1-Low.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02865v1" target="_blank"><h2>GATOS XI : Excess dust heating in the Narrow Line Regions of nearby AGN revealed with JWST/MIRI <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Houda Haidar, David J.

In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\rm shock} \sim 200- 400 \, \rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02861v1" target="_blank"><h2>BEACON: JWST NIRCam Pure-parallel Imaging Survey.

Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to $\sim350$\,arcmin$^2$ sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope ($β_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at $z=13.71\pm0.15$ has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of $M_{\rm UV}=-21.19\pm0.08$, making it the brightest galaxy at $z>12$ if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with $>3σ$ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at $z>7$, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02849v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Anisotropy of Dispersion Measure Contribution from the Galactic Halo by Using Fast Radio Bursts <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yang Liu, Bao Wang, Puxun Wu, Jun-Jie Wei, Xue-Feng Wu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> fast radio burst (title, abstract), ISM (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a data-driven approach to reconstruct the all-sky distribution of the dispersion measure contribution from the Galactic halo ($\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$) through a spherical harmonic expansion, enabling an investigation of its possible anisotropies. Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes $|b|>15^\circ$, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$, pointing toward $(l=130^\circ,\, b=+5^\circ)$ with a $1σ$ uncertainty of approximately $28^\circ$. The $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$ value in this direction is $63\pm9~\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, exceeding the all-sky mean by about $2.6σ$. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic ISM models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of $(l=141^\circ,\, b=+51^\circ)$ and a larger 1$σ$ uncertainty of $\sim 44^\circ$. Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02789v1" target="_blank"><h2>Indications of a Late-Time Transition to a Strongly Interacting Dark Sector <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andronikos Paliathanasis<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-06<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore the transition from the $Λ$CDM to an interacting dark sector by introducing a model with a redshift threshold that controls the onset of the energy transfer between the dark energy and the dark matter. Below the transition redshift, the interaction between dark matter and dark energy becomes active, while at earlier times the cosmological evolution coincides with that of $Λ$CDM. This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}<0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$.

Although early studies typically adopted a single-disk model, we detect two distinct components at Galactocentric distances of 5-14 kpc, enabled by photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric measurements of over 5 million stars. The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively.

However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02579v1" target="_blank"><h2>COUGS-DESI: A Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with Polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Seneca K.

These systems, which include polar rings, polar disks, polar halos, polar bulges, polar dust lanes, and polar tidal structures, provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution, although their rarity has limited statistical studies. We aim to construct the largest and most homogeneous catalog of PSGs to date in order to enable robust statistical studies of their properties and occurrence rates in the local Universe. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR10) data, we identified PSG candidates in the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA) through visual inspection, convolutional neural network classification, and cross-matching with previously reported systems. Each galaxy was assigned a PSG subtype and host morphology. We analyzed general properties of PSGs and compared them with those for all galaxies in the SGA. Simple image simulations were used to evaluate projection effects. The resulting Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (COUGS-DESI) contains 2,989 PSG candidates, including 342 previously known objects. Projection effects from random galaxy overlaps are negligible. The sample spans a wide range of polar morphologies, with 1,113 polar rings, 75 polar bulges, 216 polar halos, 185 polar dust lanes, and 1,315 polar tidal structures. PSGs constitute 2.2% of local non-dwarf galaxies, with polar rings representing 0.7%. Approximately 1% of S0 galaxies in the SGA host polar rings, whereas spirals constitute the most common morphological type among the PSG hosts in our catalog. COUGS--DESI increases the number of known PSG candidates by an order of magnitude and provides a foundation for detailed studies of the formation and evolution of polar structures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02534v1" target="_blank"><h2>Composite Bulges -- V.

By removing angular momentum, shocks in gas cause inflows, which can trigger nuclear star formation and fuel AGN activity. To identify the signatures of extended shocks, we examine residual velocity fields after subtracting a modelled rotating disc, and we study velocity difference between various gas tracers. Combining our kinematic analysis with BPT ionisation diagnostic maps and dust morphology, we find that 11 of 21 galaxies ($\sim$52%) show extended shock signatures with velocity jumps consistent with models of bar-driven shocks. This is likely a lower limit, as three additional galaxies ($\sim$15%) exhibit shocks along bars, potentially reaching the nucleus but obscured by AGN outflows. We trace shock signatures inwards close to the resolution limit, which suggests that shocks may be the prevailing mechanism of inflow in the central kpc of galaxies. The only two unbarred galaxies in our sample are also the only systems with unperturbed kinematics and no shocks, strongly linking the perturbed gas dynamics in centres of galaxies to the presence of bars.

  We reduce and conduct the spectral analysis of the XRISM/Resolve data. The rotating, turbulent ICM in the model has a composite polytropic distribution in equilibrium in a spherically-symmetric, cosmologically motivated dark halo. The profile of rotation velocity and the distribution of turbulent velocity dispersion are described with flexible functional forms, consistent with the properties of synthetic clusters formed in cosmological simulations. Adopting realistic profiles for the metallicity distribution of the ICM and for the point spread function of XRISM and XMM-Newton, we tune via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm the observables of the intrinsic quantities of the plasma in our model to reproduce the radial profiles of the thermodynamic quantities as derived from the spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and Planck maps and the measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) non-thermal velocity dispersion and redshift (probing the LOS velocity) in the XRISM pointings.
  Our model accurately reproduces the measurements of redshift and LOS non-thermal velocity dispersion, as further demonstrated by simulating and analyzing synthetic counterparts of the XRISM spectra, in accordance with the posterior distribution of our model. We find turbulence-to-total pressure ratio $\approx$ 2% across the (0 - 650) kpc radial range, and a rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio peaking at 0.15 between 200 - 600 kpc. The hydrostatic-to-total mass ratio is $\approx$ 0.97 at r2500, the radius enclosing an overdensity of 2500 times the average value.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02494v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Origins of Azimuthal Metallicity Variations in the Galactic Disk: Insights from Kinematic Ridges with Gaia <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Carlos Jurado, Keith Hawkins, Jason A.

At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridge-like features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia DR3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the V_phi-R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of Milky Way test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemo-kinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations are too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and co-moving groups.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02483v1" target="_blank"><h2>CHANG-ES XXXVI.

Cosmic rays and magnetic fields play an important role for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Radio continuum observations allows us to study them in the haloes of edge-on galaxies. Aims. We explore the frequency dependence of the radio scale height which depends on cosmic ray transport and electron cooling. We test the influence of fundamental galaxy properties, such as star-formation rate (SFR), mass and size. Methods. We used radio continuum data of 16 edge-on galaxies from the Continuum HAloes in Nearby Galaxies -- an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). We included maps from the LOw Frequency ARray at 144 MHz and from the Jansky Very Large Array at 3 GHz with 7" angular resolution. We extracted vertical intensity profiles within the effective radio radius and fitted beam-convolved double-exponential models to separate thin and thick discs. For the thick radio discs, we computed mean spectral indices and scale-height ratios between 144 MHz and 3 GHz. Results. We find a mean scale-height ratio of 1.26 \pm 0.16. This is much lower than what we would expect for either cosmic ray diffusion or advection if synchrotron and inverse Compton losses dominate for the electrons. There is a moderate positive correlation between the ratio and spectral index of the thick disc: galaxies with high ratios have flat radio spectra. The ratio does not depend on any other galaxy parameter. The radio spectrum of the thick disc, as indicated by the radio spectral index, steepens with total mass (strong correlation) and flattens with SFR-to-mass surface density (moderate correlation). Conclusions. Galaxies with galactic winds have flat radio continuum spectra and large scale heights at low frequencies. This shows effective transport of cosmic rays in such systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02480v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic Chance Superpositions: Largest Catalog of Quasar-Galaxy Pairs at a Projected Separation of $D \lesssim 20$ kpc <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Labanya Kumar Guha, Raghunathan Srianand, Rajeshwari Dutta<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), SDSS (abstract), dust (abstract), dust evolution (abstract), MgII absorber (abstract), MgII absorbers (abstract), quasar (title, abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract), halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the largest catalogue to date of Galaxies On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs), systems where the sightline to a background quasar passes directly through or very close to a foreground galaxy. Using $\approx$1.1 million quasar spectra from SDSS DR16 and the DESI Early Data Release, we identify 1345 unique GOTOQs over the redshift range $0.0045 \leq z \leq 1.09$, more than quadrupling the number previously known. The catalogue combines both absorption agnostic and absorption selected searches, enabling a statistically robust characterization of gas in galaxies at projected separations $D \lesssim 20$ kpc. The GOTOQ emission line ratios indicate that their host galaxies are predominantly normal, star forming disks with typical dust extinctions of $A_V \approx 0.5$ mag. We measure the MgII covering fraction at $D \lesssim 20$ kpc and find it to be remarkably high, $f_c = 98.2^{+1.3}_{-4.5}$ per cent, indicating that these systems trace gas rich, metal enriched regions at the disk halo interface. The median colour excess towards the quasar line of sight, $E(B-V) = 0.087$, is significantly higher than that of typical MgII absorbers, underscoring the dust rich nature of GOTOQ sightlines. From a high signal to noise composite spectrum, we report the first statistical detection of the diffuse interstellar band at $λ4428$ ($W_r = 0.055 \pm 0.011$ angstrom), revealing the presence of complex organic molecules at the disk halo interface. This catalogue provides a powerful reference sample for future multi wavelength studies of gas flows, cold gas, and dust evolution in the inner circumgalactic medium.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02469v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hunting for the First Explosions at the High-Redshift Frontier <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Junehyoung Jeon, Volker Bromm, Alessandra Venditti, Steven L.

Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\sim30$. While any $z\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at $z\sim30$, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02468v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resonances in b-EMRIs: playing the black hole piano <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> João S.

Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02466v1" target="_blank"><h2>A possible challenge for Cold and Warm Dark Matter <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

Such objects are dark and thus challenging to characterise, but they can be studied via gravitational lensing. Recently, a million-solar-mass object was discovered superposed on an extended and extremely thin gravitational arc. Here we report on extensive tests of various assumptions for the mass density profile and redshift of this object. We find models that best describe the data have two components: an unresolved point-mass of radius $\leq10$ pc centred on an extended mass distribution with an almost constant surface density out to a truncation radius of 139 pc. These properties do not resemble any known astronomical object. However, if the object is dark matter-dominated, its structure is incompatible with cold dark matter models, but may be compatible with a self-interacting dark matter halo where the central region has collapsed to form a black hole. This detection could thus carry substantial implications for our current understanding of dark matter.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02463v1" target="_blank"><h2>Electron temperature relations and the direct N, O, Ne, S and Ar abundances of 49959 star-forming galaxies in DESI Data Release 2 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> D.

Using these temperature measurements, we derive reliable abundances for N, O, Ne, S and Ar and measure the evolution of abundances and abundance ratios of as a function of metallicity and other galaxy properties. Our measurements include direct oxygen abundances for 49$\,$766 galaxies, leading to the discovery of the two most metal-poor galaxies in the nearby Universe, with oxygen abundances of $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.77_{-0.03}^{+0.03}~\rm dex$ (1.2\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$) and $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.81_{-0.04}^{+0.04}~\rm dex$ (1.3\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$). We identify a rare outlier population of 139 galaxies with high N/O ratios at low metallicity, reminiscent of galaxy abundances observed in the early Universe. We find these high N/O galaxies are more massive than typical galaxies at the same metallicity. We find the Ne/O ratio is constant at low metallicity but increases significantly at $\rm 12+log(O/H) > 8.105\pm0.004$ dex. We show that the S/O and Ar/O abundance ratios are strongly correlated, consistent with the expected additional Type Ia enrichment channel for S and Ar.

Here we present spatial and kinematic relationships between Mg II and O VI as representatives for low and high ion-bearing gas, in the cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation suite FOGGIE, a set of Milky-way-like galaxy simulations with high CGM resolution. We find the O VI-bearing gas exists as a diffuse halo around the galactic disk, while the Mg II-bearing gas is more centrally located. We investigate the covering fraction, probability of co-observation, co-kinematic correspondence of these ions using two different analysis methods. We make both mock sightlines using two-dimensional projections of our simulations treating these cells as integrated lines of sight and we create one-dimensional ray objects and use the SALSA (Boyd et al. 2020) code to investigate individual gas structures that contribute most to the line of sight column densities, which we call mock absorbers. We explore the relative kinematics of these mock absorbers and find Mg II and O VI appear to have a co-kinematic relationship when looking at absorber pairs with the closest relative velocity like in Werk et al. (2016). However, this does not necessarily correspond with a close spatial separation meaning many O VI and Mg II absorber pairs only appear to be co-kinematic but are physically unrelated. Taking a more holistic look at Mg II and O VI absorber pairs reveals a much weaker correlation between these two ions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02297v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Polarization and Magnetic Field of the Radio Arc as Observed by ALMA at 100 GHz <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nora Salem, Dylan M.

The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02287v1" target="_blank"><h2>A comprehensive search for high-velocity X-ray sources: New compact object binary candidates in the Gaia era <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yue Zhao, Poshak Gandhi, Christian Knigge, Phil Charles, Daniel Stern, Peter Boorman, Pornisara Nuchvanichakul, Cordelia Dashwood Brown, David A.

We cross-match X-ray points sources from a variety of catalogues (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift and eROSITA) with Gaia DR3. Using Gaia coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions, we compute peculiar velocities ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$) relative to Galactic disc rotation. Remaining agnostic about radial velocities (RVs), we vary RVs to find the minimum possible $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ values ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$). Uncertainties on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$ are estimated via Monte Carlo resampling, and we select X-ray sources that have $1\,σ$ lower limits on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}\geq 200\,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and high $F_\mathrm{X}/F_\mathrm{G}$ values. We show that this velocity threshold excludes most contaminants (e.g., cataclysmic variables and active binaries) while retaining a sensible fraction of compact object binaries, demonstrating that $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ could serve as an effective indicator for the presence of a neutron star or black hole companion. Our selection yields a sample of 2372 sources, from which we construct a gold sample of 7 sources that have relatively well-constrained astrometry and confident optical counterparts.

The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02269v1" target="_blank"><h2>The JWST EXCELS survey: Outflows in 1.5 < z < 5 quiescent galaxies are likely relics from episodic AGN activity <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elizabeth Taylor, Adam C.

NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from $\approx$ 300 - 1200 kms$^{-1}$, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched $\lt$ 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\simeq$ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to $\simeq$ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a $\simeq$ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02220v1" target="_blank"><h2>The NIRISS PASSAGE Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog in COSMOS <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mason S.

These single-line emitters are likely mis-identified around 18% of the time based on comparisons to photometric redshifts. We derive stellar masses using PASSAGE photometry and spectroscopic redshifts, in broad agreement with existing COSMOS-Web stellar masses, but with some discrepancy driven by redshift disagreements. We publicly release this spectroscopic redshift catalog, which will enable community-led science in prime extragalactic fields and serve as a crucial dataset for validating Euclid and Roman spectroscopy.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02104v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kandaswamy Subramanian, Bikram Phookun<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), high redshift (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02077v1" target="_blank"><h2>Joint Constraints on Neutrinos and Dynamical Dark Energy in Minimally Modified Gravity <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Artur Ladeira, Rafael C.

In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \(\sum m_ν< 0.11~\mathrm{eV}\) (95\% CL) and \(N_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \(H_0\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02074v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nonlinear Scales in Luminal Horndeski -- I.

Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02005v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: Improving redshift distribution reconstruction using a deep-to-wide transfer function <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Y.

Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01999v1" target="_blank"><h2>Proton Acceleration by Collisionless Shocks in Supermassive Black Hole Coronae: Implications for High-Energy Neutrinos <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Minh Nhat Ly, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Yasuhiko Sentoku, Takayoshi Sano<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, physics.plasm-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-05<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01991v1" target="_blank"><h2>ODIN: Clustering Properties of Ly$α$ Blobs at $z$ $\sim$ 2.4 and 3.1 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Byeongha Moon, Yujin Yang, Eric Gawiser, Kyoung-Soo Lee, Danisbel Herrera, Vandana Ramakrishnan, Nelson Padilla, Nicole M.

We measure the angular auto-correlation functions (ACFs) of LABs and derive galaxy bias factors of $b$ = $4.0\pm0.8$ and $3.8\pm0.7$, corresponding to minimum halo masses of $2.8^{+3.0}_{-1.8}$ and $0.7^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{12}~M_\odot$ and median halo masses of $4.2^{+3.8}_{-2.5}$ and $1.1^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\times10^{12}~M_\odot$ at $z\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively.

In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01748v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the interplay between molecular and ionized gas in HII regions <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> S.

We observed the $J_{K_aK_c}$ transitions of para-H2CO (within its J = 3-2 and 4-3 states) with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) 12 m submillimeter telescope using the nFLASH230 and SEPIA345 receivers towards a sample of 61 HII regions.

The deep medium-resolution spectrum enables the measurement of its stellar velocity dispersion ($σ_\star = 95_{-33}^{+38}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$), the smallest value recorded among spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$. Coupled with a compact size ($0.41\pm0.03\, {\rm kpc}$), it yields a dynamical mass estimate of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot)=9.75_{-0.38}^{+0.29}$. Its star formation history suggests that half of the stellar mass was in place $\sim1\,{\rm Gyr}$ before the observed epoch, with quenching occurring $\sim0.2\,{\rm Gyr}$ prior to $z=2.08$. These results confirm that AURORA-LQG1 is genuinely quenched, rather than in a temporary phase of suppressed star formation rate. AURORA-LQG1 is consistent with the mass fundamental plane at $z\sim2$, previously constrained only by massive quiescent systems. Compared with more massive counterparts at the same epoch observed with NIRSpec grating spectroscopy, the time since quenching for AURORA-LQG1 is among the shortest observed. The galaxy resides in a possible dense group-scale ($\sim50$ kpc) environment containing one companion with tentative spectroscopic redshift and five companion candidates, and it is embedded in a known protocluster on Mpc scales. A potential environmental influence on its evolution could explain the outside-in quenching suggested by the positive gradient of size with wavelength. This study demonstrates that deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy enables low-mass quiescent galaxies at Cosmic Noon to be characterized with a level of detail long reserved for massive systems, offering valuable new insights into how quenching operates in these underexplored low-mass systems.

Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at $z = 10.6$ reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{10.12} M_{\odot}$) than their counterparts at $z = 5.5$ ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{11.45} M_{\odot}$), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values ($b_{\rm{g}}^{\rm{eff}} = 8.13^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ compared to $5.64^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching $<1\%$ by $z \sim 5-6$.

Using the \texttt{PeTar} code, we perform direct $N$-body simulations of an open cluster initially containing $10^4$ stars, evolving within a gaseous medium spanning a range of ambient densities. Our results demonstrate that NDF associated with stellar outflows interacting with the surrounding gas can enhance the rate of cluster expansion, preferentially transporting stars toward the cluster outskirts. This behavior is accompanied by a more rapid decline in the number of binaries composed of a neutron star and a main-sequence star. A statistical analysis of binary orbital parameters further indicates that, compared to DF-dominated evolution, NDF tends to retain systems with larger semi-major axes and lower eccentricities.

This marks the first detection of GPs from a transitional MSP and adds to the small number of millisecond pulsars known to exhibit such extreme variability. A total of 235 GPs were detected across observations at 550-750 MHz, with widths as narrow as $1.28~μs$ and flux densities up to $\sim 10^4$ times the pulsar's mean flux density.

The arrival times of the GPs deviate significantly from Poisson statistics, with the waiting-time distribution well described by a Weibull model having a shape parameter of $k = 0.30$, indicative of strong temporal clustering. During an epoch of enhanced activity, the GP rate increased by nearly two orders of magnitude to $124~\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, with a corresponding shape parameter of $k = 0.47$. This value is similar to that reported for a burst storm from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20200120E, suggesting possible phenomenological parallels between GPs from compact binary systems and repeating FRBs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01540v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radio counterparts of ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yijia Zhang, Hua Feng, Ailing Wang, Roberto Soria<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Radio surveys of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) allow us to find supercritically accreting compact objects (SS 433/W50 like systems) or stripped nuclear black holes in nearby galaxies. We identified 21 such objects by crossmatching a ULX catalog with the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). They may have a diverse population. (i) Three have a double lobed radio structure with a compact core found in two of them, and could be quasars. (ii) Five are associated with extended radio structure and star forming regions in optical, where the radio emission is likely due to star forming activities, although the steep radio spectrum up to several GHz casts doubt on that. Two of them show X-ray variability suggesting that they are ULXs embedded in star forming regions. (iii) Thirteen are associated with an unresolved radio source, with a steep spectrum seen in eight, a flat or inverted spectrum seen in two. Those with a steep spectrum are arguably candidates for SS 433/W50 like objects, with radio emission due to optically thin synchrotron radiation in a surrounding jet/wind powered nebula. Remarkable cases include NGC 925 ULX1 and NGC 6946 ULX1, which are associated with an optical nebula. Those with a flat or inverted spectrum could be accreting black holes with a compact jet, while the black hole mass is estimated to be several $10^6 - 10^8$ $M_\odot$ based on the fundamental plane.

Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $σ_{\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\sim$10\% of the AGN coronae have $σ_{\rm p} \sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations. Coronal emission is suppressed at higher energies by pion and muon cooling, so that another population is required, with jetted AGN being strong candidates.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01525v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cracks in the Standard Cosmological Model: Anomalies, Tensions, and Hints of New Physics <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Eleonora Di Valentino<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmology has entered an era of unprecedented precision, yet increasing accuracy has revealed cracks in the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm. Although the model remains highly successful when confronted with individual datasets, joint analyses expose a network of tensions involving the Hubble constant, CMB lensing, curvature, neutrino masses, and the nature of dark energy. In this contribution to the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106), within the context of Working Group~2, we critically assess these discrepancies, emphasizing the role of model assumptions, parameter degeneracies, and dataset consistency. We review proposed early- and late-time solutions, discuss how recent DESI BAO results alter the viability of late-time extensions, and explore interacting dark-sector scenarios.

Archival XMM-Newton observations of 12 active galactic nuclei were analyzed to constrain properties of these absorbers. Our analysis demonstrates that the soft X-ray variability is primarily governed by fluctuation of the partial covering fraction of mildly ionized clumpy clouds. In particular, for Mrk 335, PDS 456, and 1H 0707-495, outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are constrained from the blue-shifts of the Fe-L edge structure. The blue-shifted Fe-L edge successfully reproduces the well-known complex spectral feature near 1 keV in 1H 0707--495, which was often explained by invoking an ad hoc absorption structure. Notably, the inferred outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are comparable to, or even exceed, those associated with the Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the outflow velocities and the intrinsic X-ray fluxes in two of four data sets, and the remaining two datasets also agree with this positive correlation, which supports a radiative-driven wind scenario that the X-ray/UV emission from the central black holes is causing the UFOs and the outflowing clumpy absorbers. In addition, the line-driven acceleration is likely playing a significant role, since the line opacities of the clumpy absorbers are highly sensitive to the flux changes. These findings provide a robust observational support for the ``hot inner and clumpy outer wind'' paradigm, suggesting a common origin for both the UFOs and the clumpy absorbers.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01340v1" target="_blank"><h2>Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hao Xu, Xinhe Meng<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-04<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = w_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from "standard" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $Λ$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01230v1" target="_blank"><h2>Time-delay and lens galaxy redshift in the doubly imaged quasar PS J2305+3714 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> O.

From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $λ$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $Λ$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01169v1" target="_blank"><h2>One-dimensional PIC Simulation of Induced Compton Scattering in Magnetized Electron-Positron Pair Plasma <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shoma F.

In this system, two distinct modes of density fluctuations, referred to as the charged mode and the neutral mode, are theoretically expected to arise through parametric instabilities. Our simulations confirm these predictions: in the charged mode, the electron and positron densities fluctuate oppositely (Langmuir-like), while in the neutral mode, the charge is Debye-screened and both species fluctuate in phase (acoustic-like). The linear growth rates obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with analytical estimates for both modes. We also find that, in some cases, the linear growth saturates before full scattering occurs, allowing the incident wave to propagate without significant attenuation. Our results allow us to determine whether induced Compton scattering grows linearly in magnetized pair plasmas, offering a foundation for studies of fast radio bursts and laser-plasma experiments.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01138v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fluctuation dynamos in supersonic turbulence at ${\rm Pm} \gtrsim 1$ <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ameya Uday Nagdeo, Sharanya Sur, Bhargav Vaidya<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-03<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fluctuation dynamos provide a robust mechanism for amplifying weak seed magnetic fields in turbulent astrophysical plasmas. However, their behaviour in the highly compressible regimes characteristic of the interstellar medium (ISM) remains incompletely understood. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supersonic turbulence with rms Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} \approx 11$, we explore fluctuation dynamos across magnetic Prandtl numbers ${\rm Pm} = 1-10$. At ${\rm Pm} = 1$, dynamo growth is slower and saturates at lower magnetic-to-kinetic energy ratios, with amplification in the kinematic phase dominated by compression rather than line stretching. In contrast, at ${\rm Pm} = 10$, vortical stretching emerges as the dominant mechanism, yielding faster growth, higher saturation levels, and stronger suppression of density-magnetic field correlations by magnetic pressure. This transition is reflected in the correlation coefficient between density and magnetic field strength, which is strongly positive at ${\rm Pm} = 1$ but decreases significantly at higher ${\rm Pm}$. Across all runs, the ratio of velocity-to-magnetic integral scales is $\sim 3.4$, independent of ${\rm Pm}$, while the ratio of viscous to resistive dissipation scales increase with the increase in ${\rm Pm}$. Synthetic Faraday rotation measures (RM) reveal coherence lengths of $\sim (1/4-1/3)$ of the forcing scale across the range of ${\rm Pm}$ explored. Using these coherence scales, we discuss the potential contribution of fluctuation dynamos to Faraday rotation expected from turbulent, gas rich young disk galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02416v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial Black Hole Formation in $f(R)=R+αR^2$ Gravity: Perturbative and Non-Perturbative Analysis <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> G.

For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $δ_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high.

Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $Λ$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ is constrained to be $\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00989v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmological redshift of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole: Towards estimating the Hubble constant <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Deborah Villaraos, Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar, Mehrab Momennia, Ulises Nucamendi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk.

The redshift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the test particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow. Bayesian inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is employed to estimate the black hole mass, its distance, the angular position of the emitter, and the Hubble constant, for which a Gaussian prior is assumed.

The quiescent galaxy GS10578 at z=3.1 is a key example of this population. Previous JWST/NIRSpec IFU data revealed an AGN outflow and uncovered a compact pair of AGN separated by ~5 kpc. In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of ~30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00959v1" target="_blank"><h2>Widespread Extended [CII] Emission in High-Redshift Galaxies: Insights from the FIRE-2 Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lun-Jun Liu, Guochao Sun, Andreas L.

These measurements provide new insights into high-redshift galactic ecosystems and processes that drive metal enrichment on circumgalactic scales. To better understand the nature of [CII] halos, we analyze a suite of high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations at $5 \leq z \leq 6$ in the stellar mass range of $10^{9}$--$10^{10.5}\,M_{\odot}$. By post-processing these simulations with three-dimensional dust radiative transfer and photoionization modeling, we generate synthetic images of [CII] and UV continuum emission, from which we extract one-dimensional surface brightness profiles. Our results reproduce both the galaxy-integrated and spatial distribution of [CII] and UV emission, capturing in particular the more extended profile of [CII] emission. Comparing the time evolution of [CII] halos with bursty star formation histories of the simulated galaxies, we find that [CII] emission becomes more spatially extended following the decline of star formation rate in recent starburst episodes. This implies a strong correlation between extended [CII] emission and bursty star formation, consistent with a key role for star formation-driven outflows in producing [CII] halos -- though the kinematics of [CII]-emitting gas suggest that inflows and turbulent motions are also significant contributors. We also find a modest contribution from satellite galaxies to extended [CII] emission. Our framework can be readily applied to predict the observability of [CII] halos at higher redshifts and extended to create spatially resolved synthetic observations of other important emission lines, such as [OIII] and H$α$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00952v1" target="_blank"><h2>On Cosmological Correlators at One Loop <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guilherme L.

The LMC:Milky Way (MW) interaction is also $\sim$1:10, and is expected to perturb the MW's DM distribution. However, no framework exists to quantify the severity of these perturbations over multiple pericenters and longer periods of time, such as the LMC-SMC interaction history. We construct basis function expansions of a high-resolution N-body simulation of the Clouds interacting in isolation and analyze their DM distributions at an epoch approximating the time of infall to the MW. Our goal is to quantify how the Clouds distort each other's DM distributions without the MW. The LMC halo's response to the SMC includes a $\sim 20$ kpc-long dynamical friction wake and the displacement of the LMC's density center during each SMC pericenter, which produces two overdensities in the LMC halo (at $\sim$60 and $\sim$100 kpc) at MW infall. The SMC's tidal radius at infall is just $\sim4$ kpc, at which point the SMC has lost two-thirds of its initial DM mass to the LMC. The distortions to the Clouds' halos produce a highly asymmetric acceleration field. Accurate orbit integration in the LMC-SMC system must account for the time-dependent shapes of both halos. The SMC-induced perturbations in the LMC DM halo resemble the MW-LMC system, and persist over multiple SMC pericenters.

Using one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we show that high source luminosities ($L > 10^{44}\,\rm erg~s^{-1}$) and compact ejecta radii ($r < 10^{14}\,\rm cm$) produce featureless spectra due to the high temperature and ionization state of the emitting medium. Intermediate luminosities and moderately compact systems can generate He II-dominated spectra, while lower luminosities and more extended atmospheres result in conspicuous H and He I emission. Large expansion velocities ($v \geq 0.1c$) can further broaden lines such that they blend into the continuum. Featureless UV spectra may require even more extreme ionization conditions or velocities to suppress the many intrinsically strong metal lines at those wavelengths. Applying this framework to understand the absence of features observed in LFBOTs and featureless TDEs, we find that non-homologous, compact outflows are likely necessary for featurelessness to persist in optical and UV spectra.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00795v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM finds the Changing-Look AGN NGC 1365 in an extended low state: A dense, highly ionized outflow obscures the central source <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Fatima Zaidouni, Erin Kara, Peter Kosec, Ehud Behar, Richard Mushotzky, Michael Koss, Anna Juráňová, Elias Kammoun, Laura W.

NGC 1365 is known for rapid transitions between Compton-thick and Compton-thin states, along with strong absorption from a highly ionized wind. During our observations, the source is found in a persistent low-flux state, characterized by a decrease in hard-X-ray luminosity and significant line-of-sight obscuration. In this state, XRISM/Resolve reveals clear Fe\,\textsc{xxv} and Fe\,\textsc{xxvi} absorption lines together with, for the first time in this source, corresponding emission lines. These features may arise either from reemission from a photoionized wind (P Cygni profile) or from collisionally ionized gas associated with outflow-driven shocks in the interstellar medium. We estimate the wind launch radius to be approximately $10^{16}~\mathrm{cm}$ ($\sim 10^4 R_{\mathrm{g}}$), consistent with the location of the X-ray broad-line region. We also resolve a broadened Fe K$α$ line by $σ\sim 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ placing it at similar scales to the wind, consistent with radii inferred from disk-broadening models and the variability of the Fe K$α$ broad line. The similarity of the Fe K$α$ profile to the H$β$ wing and broad Pa$α$ width indicates that the X-ray-emitting region is likely cospatial with the optical/IR broad-line region and originates from the same gas.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00767v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Dark Energy Imprints in the Lyman-Alpha Forest <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Diego Garza, Brant Robertson, Piero Madau, Nick Gnedin, Matthew W.

By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00741v1" target="_blank"><h2>Eccentric Disks from Circumbinary Rings <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Leonardo Betancourt, Andrew MacFadyen, Jonathan Zrake<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We perform high-resolution, grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of finite gaseous circumbinary rings (CBRs) viscously spreading into disks around binaries.

CBRs display weak variability above the binary orbital frequency $Ω_b$ and a dominant, robust spectral peak at $\sim0.1Ω_b$ (half the fiducial lump frequency of $\sim0.2Ω_b$). Smaller rings relax into disks with enhanced gas eccentricity up to $e\simeq 0.3$. We consider the possibility that inefficiently-accreting, intermediate-mass ($\sim10^4 M_\odot$) black hole binaries may be sources of quasi-periodic eruptions when rejected streams shock the cavity wall and radiate in the UV or soft X-ray. We discuss the implications of eccentric disks evolved from CBRs for quasar light curves and asymmetric, time-variable double-peaked line emission from disks in galactic nuclei.

They therefore serve as excellent tracers for the local physical and chemical properties of these environments. Proper models that are capable of grasping the formation and destruction of COMs are crucial to understanding observations. However, given that distinct COMs may be detected from different locations and at varying times, we improve UCLCHEM - a gas-grain chemical code - to a one-dimensional, time-dependent model, tailored to protostars. In this update, we examine two stages of a protostar: the prestellar and heating stages, incorporating a simple radiative mechanism for both the internal and external radiation fields of the cloud. This approach relies on the key assumption that the dust and gas temperatures are completely coupled. Ultimately, we implement an updated version of our model to interpret observations obtained through both single-dish and interferometry under varying conditions, including a SgrB2(N1) hot core, massive Galactic clumps and a hot core in Orion. We show that our model could reproduce these observations well, highlighting that some COMs are positioned at a higher temperature in the envelope, whereas others are from the lower temperature, potentially leading to misinterpretation when using a single-point model. In a particular case of SgrB2(N1), the best model indicates that the cosmic-ray ionisation rate significantly exceeds the value typically used for the standard interstellar medium. Our model shows as an efficient computational tool particularly useful for better insights into observations of COMs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00692v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hadronic Origin of Sub-PeV Gamma-Ray Emission from LHAASO J0621+3755 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sonali Sahoo, Ankan Roy, Kritika Yadav, Reetanjali Moharana<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-02<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $η_p\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity.

Morphology population studies on X-ray selected clusters will be biased without taking into account selection, as cool cores are more easily detected at low redshifts, but can be mistaken for point sources at high redshift. eROSITA, aboard SRG, found over 12000 optically-identified clusters in its first survey, eRASS1. Taking account of the selection function obtained from simulations, we obtain using a Bayesian framework the intrinsic distribution of morphological parameters, including the concentration, central density, cuspiness, ellipticity and slosh. We construct scaling relations for the parameters as a function of redshift (z) and luminosity (LX), and study their distribution within z or LX bins. We find that the concentration in a scaled aperture evolves positively with LX, similarly to the central scaled density, and negatively with z. When using a fixed aperture, its evolution with LX is lower, but also dependent on the choice of cluster centre. The mean ellipticity does not significantly evolve with z or LX. eRASS1 clusters show indications of higher concentrations compared to SZ-selected objects, even after taking account the selection; this suggests that if our X-ray selection model is correct SZ-selected clusters may also suffer from morphological selection effects. We compare different parameter distribution models in bins of z and LX. The distribution of concentration and ellipticity is generally consistent with a normal one, but other parameters such as the central density and cuspiness strongly favour more complex distributions. However, modelling of all clusters as a single population generally prefers non-normal distributions.

We found that the AGN fraction decreases as a function of void-centric distance, with void galaxies displaying the highest AGN fraction (12\%), and galaxies in denser environments, showing the lowest AGN fraction (6.7\%), consistent with observations. The AGN fraction is particularly high in most massive void galaxies when controlling for stellar mass.
  When comparing AGN host galaxies to inactive ones, we find that AGN galaxies tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs, higher specific star formation rates, and reside in higher-mass haloes at a given stellar mass than non-AGN galaxies. At $\rm M_{*} > \rm 10^{10.2} \rm M_{\odot}$, AGN hosts in voids tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs than those in denser environments. Otherwise, the AGN population does not show a clear trend in relation to the global environment. In contrast, non-AGN void galaxies host more massive SMBHs, slightly higher sSFRs, and are located in more massive haloes than those in denser environments. Analysing the recent merger histories of both AGN and non-AGN populations, we find that a larger fraction of massive AGN galaxies have undergone major mergers compared to non-AGN galaxies, regardless of environment. Notably, AGN galaxies in voids show a higher frequency of recent mergers, especially major mergers, than their counterparts in other environments, especially at high stellar mass.
  Our results suggest that the evolution of SMBHs in voids is closely related to that of their host galaxies and their surrounding environment, while the most recent AGN activity is more strongly linked to recent interactions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00522v1" target="_blank"><h2>A New Empirical Fit to Galaxy Rotation Curves <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> David C.

Unlike parametric halo models or modified gravity theories, this approach does not alter Newtonian dynamics or invoke dark matter distributions. Instead, it identifies a repeatable kinematic offset that aligns with observed rotation profiles across a wide range of galaxies. Using SPARC data [1], we demonstrate that this model consistently achieves high fidelity fits, often outperforming MOND and CDM halo models in RMSE and R-squared metrics without parametric tuning. The method is reproducible, minimally dependent on mass modeling, and offers a streamlined alternative for characterizing galactic dynamics. While the velocity correction ω lacks a definitive physical interpretation, its empirical success invites further exploration. We position this model as a local kinematic tool rather than a cosmological framework, and we welcome dialogue on its implications for galactic structure and gravitational theory. Appendix B presents RMSE and R2 comparisons showing that this method consistently outperforms MOND and CDM halo models across a representative galaxy sample.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00495v1" target="_blank"><h2>Late-Time Resolution of the Hubble Tension in CPL Cosmology with Massive Neutrinos via Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Muhammad Yarahmadi, Amin Salehi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2026-01-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the Hubble constant within the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on the standard $Λ$CDM model and its dynamical dark energy extensions described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, both with and without massive neutrinos. By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $Λ$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $Σm_ν$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\sim1$-$2σ$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00441v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mass-loaded magnetic explosions in the context of Magnetar Giant Flares and Fast Radio Bursts <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Konstantinos N.

Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00437v1" target="_blank"><h2>Low Metallicity Gas on the Outskirts of the Local Group: the Circumgalactic Medium of Sextans B <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrew J.

In this study, we investigated the variability of the torus by analyzing temporal asymmetry in the mid-infrared (MIR) continuum. We compared ensemble structure functions between the brightening and dimming phases for AGNs at $0.15<z<0.4$, using monitoring data in the optical from the Zwicky Transient Facility and in the MIR from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We found that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors exhibit positive temporal asymmetry in the MIR, indicating that their variability amplitude is larger when brightening. Conversely, those with redder colors show negative asymmetry, exhibiting larger variability amplitude when decaying. However, there is no significant temporal asymmetry in the $g$-band variability driven by the accretion disk, suggesting that the temporal asymmetry in the MIR continuum primarily originates from intrinsic processes in the torus instead of the reflection of the ultraviolet-optical variability from the accretion disk. Analysis of the composite light curves revealed that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors tend to brighten gradually in the MIR, leading to the observed temporal asymmetry.

JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \& optical measurements provided by JWST.

Cluster membership was determined using the UPMASK algorithm, resulting in probable member counts ranging from 337 to 1498 across the clusters. Bayesian MCMC isochrone fitting yielded cluster ages in the range $\log t \sim 7.0$ -$8.15$, with uncertainties of $\sim 0.11$-$0.18$. Reddening values ranged from $E(B-V)=0.093$ mag in NGC 2301 to $1.24$ mag in NGC 7510, consistent with their positions near the Galactic plane. The stellar mass function slopes ($α\approx 2.00$-$2.26$) closely match the Salpeter IMF, with total stellar masses spanning nearly an order of magnitude, from $\sim 486\,M_\odot$ in NGC 2301 to $\sim 3584\,M_\odot$ in NGC 663. Dynamical relaxation times indicate that only NGC 2301 ($τ\approx 10.00$) and NGC 2384b ($τ\approx 2.03$) are dynamically relaxed; the others remain dynamically evolving. Orbital integrations in the MWPotential2014 model reveal nearly circular Galactic orbits with very low eccentricities ($e \approx 0.003$-$0.014$) and small vertical distances ($Z_{\rm max} < 0.142$ kpc), confirming their confinement to the thin disk. SED and kinematic analysis show that NGC 2384a and NGC 2384b are separated by $\sim 0.55$ kpc, indicating an optical pair.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00055v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolved Supergiants in PHANGS I: Red Supergiants in 19 Galaxies between 5-20 Mpc with HST and JWST <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sumit K.

Extragalactic surveys of RSGs have a long history in the Local Group, but few studies exist beyond that due to the limited resolution and sensitivity of ground-based and previous space-based infrared observatories. Here we demonstrate the combined power of HST and JWST to push systematic searches of RSGs out to $\sim$20 Mpc. We introduce a catalog of 97057 RSGs -- the largest single-survey release of RSGs -- with masses $\gtrsim$10 M$_{\odot}$ in 19 galaxies from the PHANGS HST+JWST Treasury program. We use HST F814W and JWST F200W photometry to select stars as RSGs based on predicted colors and magnitudes from PARSEC isochrones. The spatial distribution of our recovered RSGs follow the familiar pattern of mostly being concentrated in active star-forming regions such as spiral arms and central starburst rings. The RSG number density on kpc-scales is strongly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.82) with local star-formation rate density ($Σ_{SFR}$) traced by extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet (FUV) from GALEX+WISE, and weakly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.57) with the total stellar mass density ($Σ_*$), traced by near-infrared emission from WISE+Spitzer. The number of RSGs per mass of stellar populations with ages 6-30 Myr (the likely age range of RSGs $>$10 M$_{\odot}$) is $\sim$1 per 10$^{3.77\pm0.27}$ M$_{\odot}$, assuming constant star-formation rates from FUV+W4. Our sample will be a useful resource for tracking progenitors and feedback sites of future supernovae in PHANGS, age-dating stellar populations, and more.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25040v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards precision cosmology with Voids x CMB correlations (I): Roman-Agora mock catalogs and pipeline validation <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Mar Pérez Sar, Carlos Hernández Monteagudo, András Kovács, Alice Pisani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-31<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We construct and validate a set of multi-purpose mock galaxy catalogs designed to capture, to different degrees of accuracy, the main characteristics of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey. These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24978v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-Frequency Study of FRB20201124A with the uGMRT</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> C.

The bursts exhibit significant morphological diversity, including multiple sub-bursts, downward frequency drifts, and intrinsic widths ranging from 1.032 - 32.159 ms. Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline. Consecutive bursts were observed with separations of 16.7 - 291.5 ms, revealing short repetition intervals or potential sub-second quasi-periodicity. The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law. Multi-frequency analysis further shows closely spaced burst pairs across Band 4 and Band 5, with sub-second offsets of 1.08 - 1.15 s, and no strict simultaneity with contemporaneous FAST detections.

Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24936v1" target="_blank"><h2>Searching for Periodicity in FRB 20240114A <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

Extending previous formulations, a non-relativistic matter component is included explicitly, which allows a self consistent description of cosmological dynamics from the radiation-dominated era to late-time acceleration. Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24840v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scalable Stellar Parameter Inference Using Python-based LASP: From CPU Optimization to GPU Acceleration <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jun-Chao Liang, Yin-Bi Li, A-Li Luo, Fang Zuo, Bing Du, Shuo Li, Xiao-Xiao Ma, Shu-Guo Ma, Hai-Ling Lu, Ke-Fei Wu, Zhi-Hua Zhong, Wen Hou, Xiao Kong, Shuo Ye, Li-Li Wang, Hugh R.

Rather than a direct code translation, this framework refactors LASP with two complementary modules: LASP-CurveFit, a new implementation of the LASP fitting procedure that runs on a CPU, preserving legacy logic while improving data I/O and multithreaded execution efficiency; and LASP-Adam-GPU, a GPU-accelerated method that introduces grouped optimization by constructing a joint residual function over multiple observed and model spectra, enabling high-throughput parameter inference across tens of millions of spectra. Applied to 10 million LAMOST spectra, the framework reduces runtime from 84 to 48 hr on the same CPU platform and to 7 hr on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, while producing results consistent with those from the original pipeline. The inferred errors agree well with the parameter variations from repeat observations of the same target (excluding radial velocities), while the official empirical errors used in LASP are more conservative. When applied to DESI DR1, our effective temperatures and surface gravities agree better with APOGEE than those from the DESI pipeline, particularly for cool giants, while the latter performs slightly better in radial velocity and metallicity. These results suggest that the framework delivers reliable accuracy, efficiency, and transferability, offering a practical approach to parameter inference in large spectroscopic surveys.

Conventional methods rely on empirical features like hardness ratios and reliable localization, which are not always precisely available during early detection. We developed the Lightweight Unified Neural Classifier for High-energy Transients (LUNCH) - an end-to-end deep-learning framework that performs general transient classification directly from raw multi-band light curves, eliminating the need for background subtraction or source localization. Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data. Feature visualization reveals well-separated class clusters, confirming physical interpretability.

We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii ($r_e \sim 30-100$ pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses $m$ few $\times 10^{-22}$ eV are plausible for soliton masses $M_s \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\odot$; we adopt $m_{22}=2$ as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching $N_H \ge 10^{24} - 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an "Opacity Crisis") and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using $512^3$ pseudo-spectral Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high-density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings.

The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\rm log}~M_d \sim {\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \sim ζ_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24670v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dust destruction in bubbles driven by multiple supernovae explosions <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Evgenii O.

We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\ast > 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ it is less $0.4$\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\ast < 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\ast \sim 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\ast \sim 8\times 10^5 M_\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters. We point out that the interstellar dust lifetime for a given SN rate is at least a factor $\sim 10$ longer as compared to the estimates derived from an isolated SN.

By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($Γ_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($σ_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($η$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $Γ_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+σ_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($η\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($σ_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes.

These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 < i < 18) galaxies, with $σ_{NMAD}\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24502v1" target="_blank"><h2>Higgs-like inflation in scalar-torsion $f(T,φ)$ gravity in light of ACT-SPT-DESI constraints <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nitesh Kumar, Giovanni Otalora, Rodrigo Reyes, Bastian Espinoza, Manuel Gonzalez-Espinoza, Emmanuel N.

Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24433v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Convolutional Neural Network for the Recovery of Transfer Functions From Velocity-Resolved Reverberation Mapping Data <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kirk Long, Keith Horne, Jason Dexter, Benoit Tremblay<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> One of the hallmarks of active galactic nuclei are that they are highly variable with time. In watching the spectra vary it has been observed that the emission-lines often appear to "reverberate" -- that is they vary in response to continuum variations assumed to originate close to the black hole. This critical observation underlies the reverberation mapping technique, an elegant physics experiment that has allowed us to characterize the environment around many supermassive black holes in nearby active galactic nuclei. Recent observations are of such quality that the response can be measured as a function of velocity across the emission-line, and in doing so we can construct velocity-delay maps that show the structure and physics of the gas in the broad-line region better than any other measurement to date. Unfortunately constructing such maps requires a deconvolution, and given that the data are often noisy and with gaps such deconvolutions are non-trivial. Here we present a novel deconvolution method for the recovery of velocity-delay maps using a custom convolutional neural network architecture, showcasing that such methods have great promise for the deconvolution of reverberation mapping data products. While we have designed this new method with the BLR in mind, in principle this technique could be applied to any reverberation deconvolution problem, including in the accretion disk and torus.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24422v1" target="_blank"><h2>OmniCosmos: Transferring Particle Physics Knowledge Across the Cosmos <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vinicius Mikuni, Ibrahim Elsharkawy, Benjamin Nachman<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Foundation models build an effective representations of data that can be deployed on diverse downstream tasks.

We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $λ$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $λ$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $λ\sim \pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$ and $λ\gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24299v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Nbody1 to Nbody7: the Growth of Sverres Industry <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Rainer Spurzem<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> From NBODY1 to NBODY6 : The Growth of an Industry is the title of a 1999 invited review by Sverre Aarseth, for Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP).

My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24187v1" target="_blank"><h2>Connecting disc-corona physics and ionised outflows in AGN in the 2040s <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Susanna Bisogni, Giustina Vietri, Andrea Travascio, Adriana Gargiulo, Chiara Mancini, Swayamtrupta Panda<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title), outflow (title), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), time-domain (abstract), CGM (abstract), circumgalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We outline a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys aimed at connecting the physics of the accretion disc and X-ray corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the properties of their nebular regions and circumgalactic medium (CGM).

We propose an observational strategy based on rest-frame UV/optical spectroscopy of $\sim 10^{4}-10^{5}$ AGN, a time-domain reverberation-mapping tier for a well-defined subsample, coordinated X-ray coverage, and wide-field IFU mapping of CGM emission (including H$α$ and Ly$α$).

Previous studies have hinted at a possible linear correlation between the hard X-ray and high-energy neutrino emission in active galactic nuclei. New \textit{NuSTAR} observations, first presented here, reveal that blazar PKS 1424+240, located within a prominent IceCube neutrino hotspot, is far fainter in hard X-rays than expected from this trend. Motivated by this apparent ambiguity, we identify the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 5610, also coincident with the hotspot, whose unabsorbed hard X-ray flux exceeds that of PKS 1424+240 by about an order of magnitude. When the local IceCube neutrino flux is apportioned between the two AGN in proportion to their hard X-ray emission, both align with the previously suggested X-ray-neutrino correlation. This suggests that certain IceCube hotspots may be unresolved blends of multiple AGN, and supports a multimessenger scenario in which high-energy neutrinos and hard X-rays originate from the same hadronic interactions, with the X-ray emission produced through cascade reprocessing.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24141v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of Accretion Properties in Mrk 1040 using long-term X-ray Observations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Prantik Nandi, Narendranath Layek, Sandip K Chakrabarti, Sachindra Naik, Priyadarshee P.

The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\rm e,warm} \sim 0.26$~keV and a radial extent of $R_{\rm warm} \sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe~K$α$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk~1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\rm BH} = (4.50 \pm 1.62) \times 10^7~M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24054v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of particle feedback on particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shimin Liang, Nianyu Yi<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> physics.plasm-ph, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> feedback (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in astrophysical plasmas and an efficient mechanism for particle acceleration.

Our simulations demonstrate that particle feedback to the fluid amplifies shear flows within magnetic islands, which strengthens the convective electric field and thereby boosts particle acceleration. This mechanism results in a higher maximum particle energy and a harder non-thermal energy spectrum. The guide field suppresses both the increase in gas internal energy and particle acceleration.

As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23958v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variation of the 2175 Å extinction feature in Andromeda galaxy <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Bing Yan, Shu Wang, Jian Gao, Yuxi Wang, Bingqiu Chen<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), interstellar dust (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Extinction curves contain key information on interstellar dust composition and size distribution, with the 2175 Å bump being the most prominent feature.

The strength of the 2175 Å feature varies widely, including two sightlines where the bump is essentially absent.

However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU/VLT data, we explored its gaseous structure through optical emission lines to gain insights into the present-day drivers of gas physics in this dIrr, and we place constraints on the chemical evolution scenario responsible for this low chemical enrichment. The emission line maps reveal that the strongest emission comes from the south-west region. A stratified distribution of ionic species was detected, likely powered by the young star cluster at the nebular centre. HST/ACS data show that the brightest star is in the centre of both the HII region and the star cluster. Photoionization production rates derived indicate that this star can sustain the ionization budget to power the HII region, although subject to the assumed electron density. Using the direct method, we derived a metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.29\pm0.06$ dex, increasing to $7.46\pm0.09$ dex after correcting for temperature fluctuations, placing Leo A in the low-mass end of the MZR. Chemical evolution models suggest that, under constant accretion, the stellar mass growth and metal enrichment over the last 10 Gyr are successfully reproduced by both leaky-box and gas-regulator models. Those results are similar to those found in SagDIG, supporting a picture in which the present-day evolution of Leo A is dominated by stellar feedback processes. The combination of mass loss mechanisms and accretion events reproduces its chemical evolution, suggesting that Leo A has evolved under a gas equilibrium regime across its lifetime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23811v1" target="_blank"><h2>Clustering of cosmic string loops within a Milky-way like halo <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Itamar Allali, Mudit Jain, Shi Yan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Loops of cosmic string experience a recoil from anisotropic gravitational radiation, known as the rocket effect, which influences the extent to which they are captured by galaxies during structure formation. Analytical studies have reached different conclusions regarding loop capture in galaxies: early treatments argued for efficient capture, while later analyses incorporating the loop rocket force throughout halo formation found that capture efficiency is reduced and strongly dependent on loop size. In this work, we employ the N-body simulation code GADGET-4, introducing non-backreacting tracer particles subject to a constant recoil force to model cosmic string loops with the rocket effect. We simulate the formation of a Milky-Way-like halo from redshift $z=127$ to $z=0$, considering loop populations characterized by a range of length parameters $ξ$, inversely proportional to the rocket acceleration. We find that the number of captured loops exhibits a pronounced peak at $ξ_{\textrm{peak}}\simeq 12.5$, arising from the competition between rocket-driven ejection at small $ξ$ and the declining intrinsic loop abundance at large $ξ$. For fiducial string tensions, this corresponds to $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ loops within the halo. We further find that loops with weak rocket forces closely trace the dark-matter distribution, while those subject to stronger recoil but still captured -- particularly the most abundant loops near $ξ_{\textrm{peak}}$ -- are preferentially concentrated toward the central regions of the halo.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23789v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dark Recipe for the First Giants: From Population III Stars to Early Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Matter Capture <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sulagna Bhattacharya, Debajit Bose, Basudeb Dasgupta, Jaya Doliya, Ranjan Laha<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), high redshift (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts ($z>5$), as revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), challenges standard black hole (BH) formation scenarios.

We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\arcsec\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23252v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interpreting the diversity of afterglow emission from radio-detected tidal disruption events with instantaneous and delayed outflows <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yuri Sato, Mukul Bhattacharya, Jose Carpio, Jewel Capili, Kohta Murase<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (title, abstract), outflow (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is gravitationally disrupted by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole during a close encounter. Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23231v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling Multimessenger Emission from Hidden Cores of Microquasars <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yu-Jia Wei, Kohta Murase, B.

They are established sources of 100~TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $>$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $pγ$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $γγ$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23157v1" target="_blank"><h2>The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program.

We conduct a systematic search for quasars behind the Galactic plane using X-ray sources from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC 2.1), combined with optical data from Gaia DR3 and mid-infrared data from CatWISE2020. Using spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars from data sets including DESI, SDSS, and LAMOST, we apply a Random Forest classifier to identify quasar candidates, with stellar contaminants suppressed using Gaia proper-motion constraints. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the candidates using a Random Forest regression model. Applying this framework to previously unclassified CSC sources, we identify 6286 quasar candidates, including 863 Galactic Plane Quasar (GPQ) candidates at |b|<20°, of which 514 are high-confidence candidates. Relative to the previously known GPQ sample, our selected GPQs reach fainter optical and X-ray fluxes, improving sensitivity to low-flux GPQs. In addition, both the GPQ candidates and known GPQs display harder X-ray spectra than the all-sky quasar sample, consistent with increased absorption through the Galactic plane. Pilot spectroscopy confirms two high-confidence GPQ candidates as quasars at spectroscopic redshifts of z=1.2582 and z=1.1313, and further spectroscopic follow-up of the GPQ sample is underway. This work substantially improves the census of GPQs and provides a valuable target sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, enabling the use of GPQs to refine the reference frames for astrometry and probe the Milky Way interstellar and circumgalactic media with the absorption features of GPQs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22751v2" target="_blank"><h2>Rotation and stability of the circumnuclear gas disk in the Galactic Center potential by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yoshiaki Sofue, Steven N.

While morphological features such as tidal bridges have been visually identified in past surveys, our quantitative analysis using SDSS DR16 kinematical data reveals a significant radial velocity offset of approximately 8372 km/s. UGC 694 exhibits a heliocentric velocity of 12683 +/- 34 km/s, placing it at a distance of approximately 188 Mpc, whereas IC 412 is located in the foreground at approximately 62 Mpc with a velocity of 4311 +/- 46 km/s. This vast spatial separation of approximately 123.5 Mpc confirms that the perceived proximity is a line-of-sight projection effect rather than a physical gravitational encounter. Furthermore, we utilize differential photometry to analyze the structural asymmetry and color distribution of UGC 694. Our photometric findings suggest that the galaxy's disturbed morphology is not a result of a tidal encounter with IC 412, but likely originates from internal evolutionary processes or minor mergers with undetected companions.

The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ λ1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\b{eta}, Mgii λ 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii λ1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas. Our findings provide new constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of AGN winds, providing clear evidence in favor of stratified wind emission.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22566v1" target="_blank"><h2>Starkindler: An Uncertainty Aware Objective for Photometric Redshift Estimation <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Raahul Singh, Ashutosh Pandey<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-27<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Photometric Redshift is critical for analyzing astronomical objects, but existing ML methods often overlook the aleatoric uncertainties inherent in observed data.

Unlike traditional probabilistic models that focus solely on epistemic uncertainty, Starkindler provides uncertainty estimates that are regularised by aleatoric uncertainty, and is designed to be more interpretable. We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS. We show improvements in accuracy, calibration and reduction in predicted outlier rate. We also conduct an ablation study which confirms that excluding observational errors significantly degrades model performance, underscoring the importance of accounting for aleatoric uncertainty.

As a major component of the universe, dark matter plays a pivotal role in cosmic evolution, particularly in the formation of large-scale structures. However, its fundamental nature remains elusive. Axion-like particles (ALPs), as promising dark matter candidates, possess unique advantages in naturally explaining such phenomena. Previous studies on the implications of cosmic birefringence for these ultralight ALP fields have focused on single-field models with conventional potentials. These models face exclusion due to the washout effect - a suppression of the CMB polarization power spectrum induced by oscillatory dynamics of the scalar field within the mass range of less than $10^{-23}$ eV. To address this limitation, we develop a more general theoretical framework incorporating two ALP fields, providing analytical approximations and numerical calculations. Our findings reveal that the superposition of two ALP fields with distinct masses can relax the constraints imposed by the washout effect and reconcile with observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21780v1" target="_blank"><h2>The rotation curve of the Milky Way measured by Classical Cepheids from Gaia DR3 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Qikang Feng, Yang Huang, Huawei Zhang, Jifeng Liu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We determine the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way in the range 6 < R < 18 kpc using a sample of 903 carefully selected classical Cepheids with precise proper motions and high-quality radial velocities from \emph{Gaia} DR3. Their distances can be accurately measured from the well-known Period-Wesenheit relations. The RC is computed from the three-dimensional velocity components of these Cepheids. Generally, the RC shows a slight decline with distance from the Galactic center. On top of this general trend, the newly constructed RC shows a dip around R ~ 10-11 kpc, followed by a bump around R ~ 13-14 kpc. This feature has also been reported in other RC measurements, mostly in RCs traced by young tracers like Cepheids. To better constrain the Milky Way mass, an averaged RC is then constructed by combining measurements from this work and previous efforts. Due to the ambiguous nature of the dip-and-bump feature, this averaged RC is constructed only within the radial range where the RC appears to be less influenced by this feature. By using this averaged RC, we determine the circular velocity at solar position and also build a parameterized mass model of our Milky Way. The result for the circular velocity at the solar position is $V_c(R_0) = 236.8 \pm 0.8\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which is in good agreement with previous measurements. The local dark matter density and the enclosed dark matter halo mass within 18 kpc are estimated from the averaged RC under different baryonic models, yielding a series of consistent results: a local density of $0.33-0.40\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and an enclosed mass of $1.19-1.45 \times 10^{11}\ M_\odot$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21674v2" target="_blank"><h2>A systematic study on the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon emission features of nearby galaxies using AKARI near-IR spectra <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tsubasa Kondo, Hidehiro Kaneda, Shinki Oyabu, Takuma Kokusho, Toyoaki Suzuki, Risako Katayama, Eiko Kozaki, Itsuka Yachi, Keita Yoshida, Shohei Ono<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Interstellar hydrocarbon dust containing aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is believed to be processed by various factors including UV radiation fields and mechanical shocks in the galactic environments. We systematically investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust, especially the likely causes for the variations of the luminosity ratio of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, using the near-infrared (IR) spectral features at wavelengths 3.3 um and 3.4-3.6 um observed with AKARI/IRC. We analyzed 243 near-IR spectra of 240 star-forming (U)LIRGs (the total IR luminosity, $L_\rm{IR}>10^{11}\ L_\odot$), 119 spectra of 105 star-forming IRGs ($10^{10}\ L_\odot<L_\rm{IR}<10^{11}\ L_\odot$), and 94 spectra of 65 sub-IRGs ($L_\rm{IR}<10^{10}\ L_\odot$), in addition to 232 spectra of 36 Galactic HII regions as a reference sample. We performed near-IR spectral model fitting to estimate the luminosities of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon features and the HI recombination line Br$\rmα$. The result indicates that the luminosity ratios of the aliphatic to the aromatic hydrocarbons ($L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$) in the sample galaxies show considerably large variations, compared to those in the Galactic HII regions, $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$ systematically decreasing with $L_\rm{IR}$ and $L_\rm{Brα}$. We find that (sub-)IRGs with continuum colors bluer at 4 um tend to have higher $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to reflect the intrinsic nature of PAHs outside the HII region where the PAHs remain non-processed by strong UV radiation fields. We also find that some ULIRGs with continuum colors redder at 4 um show extremely low $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to be caused by blending aliphatic emission and absorption features due to the presence of an obscured galactic nucleus in merger systems.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21669v1" target="_blank"><h2>VLBI Diagnostics of Off-axis Jets in Radio Flares of Tidal Disruption Events <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tatsuya Matsumoto<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21632v1" target="_blank"><h2>Can A Kinematically Hot and Thick Disk Form A Bar? : Role of Highly Spinning Dark Matter Halos <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Sandeep Kumar Kataria<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-25<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), high redshift (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22268v1" target="_blank"><h2>Quenching pathways in the green valley at low redshift: confronting SDSS AGN hosts with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Gaurav Gawade<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (title, abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We compare low-redshift ($z<0.1$) BPT-selected pure optical AGN hosts in SDSS DR7 to colour-selected "green-valley" analogue central galaxies in IllustrisTNG100 and EAGLE Ref-L0100N1504. To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)>10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc). SDSS hosts are linked to the MPA-JHU catalogue for stellar masses and aperture-corrected total SFRs. TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-14.85$ ($\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts.

In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21303v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bar Formation in Disc Galaxies: Internal Kinematics and Environmental Influence in MaNGA Galaxies <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Erik Aquino-Ortíz, Bernardo Cervantes-Sodi, Karol Chim-Ramirez<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract), kinematics (title)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore how the physical properties of disc galaxies relate to the presence of bars using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $λ_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21240v2" target="_blank"><h2>Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $γ$-ray Variability in CTA 102 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Agniva Roychowdhury<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, physics.plasm-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $γ$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21376v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Velocity Coupled Radial Acceleration Ansatz for Disk-Galaxy Rotation Curves: Fits to SPARC, Bayesian Inference, and Parameter Identifiability <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nalin Dhiman<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, physics.comp-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-24<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observed rotation curves of disk galaxies remain a sharp empirical probe of the relationship between baryons and dynamics. We study a minimal, explicitly \emph{phenomenological} alternative to standard halo parameterizations: an additional inward \emph{radial} acceleration proportional to the local \emph{tangential} speed, $a_{\vca}(r)=γ(r)\,v(r)$, with a saturating coupling $γ(r)=\vinf/(r+\rzero)$. Combining this ansatz with the circular-motion condition yields a quadratic equation for $v(r)$ with a closed-form physical branch.We fit this ``velocity-coupled acceleration'' (\vca) model to $N_\mathrm{gal}=171$ rotation curves from the SPARC sample using the published baryonic decompositions (gas, disk, bulge), and we compare to two commonly used two-parameter halo models (NFW and Burkert) using an identical optimization pipeline and error model.For a fiducial systematic error floor $σ_0=5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the \vca model is typically competitive with an NFW halo and performs comparably (though not uniformly better) than a Burkert halo in information-criterion comparisons.We further perform MCMC inference for \vca parameters, quantify posterior predictive coverage, and show that parameter posteriors exhibit a strong $\vinf$--$\rzero$ degeneracy for many galaxies; only $47/171$ galaxies yield well-identified posteriors under simple width-based criteria. We also perform a simple radial holdout cross-validation (outer 30\% of radii) and find predictive RMSE comparable to NFW and Burkert under this protocol.Finally..</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20999v1" target="_blank"><h2>DRAGNs in the Forest: Identifying Artifacts with Random Forest Models in the VLASS DRAGNs Catalog <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Verene Einwalter, Eric J.

We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20702v1" target="_blank"><h2>BASS.L.

This dataset is the largest compilation of rest-frame NIR spectroscopic observations of hard-X-ray-selected AGN and includes the full DR2 sample. Observations were obtained with VLT X-shooter, a multiwavelength (0.3$-$2.5$μ$m) spectrograph ($R$ = 4,000$-$18,000), using a $\geq 2 σ$ detection threshold, enabling broad analysis of emission features. We find that NIR coronal lines, particularly SiVI $\lambda1.964$, are more reliable tracers of AGN luminosity than optical [OIII], showing a tighter correlation with hard X-ray luminosity ($σ=0.25$dex) than [OIII] $\lambda5007$ ($σ=0.55$dex). Broad Paschen lines (Pa$α$ and Pa$β$) are detected in 12% of Seyfert 2 and 57% of Seyfert 1.9, consistent with previous hidden BLR studies. We introduce a refined NIR diagnostic diagram (FeII $\lambda1.257$$μ$m/Pa$β$ and H$_2$ $λ2.122$$μ$m/Br$γ$) that effectively distinguishes AGN, star-forming, and composite sources even when contamination limits individual diagnostics or only upper limits are available.

The hot-to-cold gas mass ratio spans four orders of magnitude, averaging $\sim 3 \times 10^{-7}$, indicating diverse molecular gas excitation processes likely driven by star formation and AGN feedback.

We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 133 papers (1 new, 132 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
