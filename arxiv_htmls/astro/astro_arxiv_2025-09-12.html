ultra-broadband exploration of the deep radio sky. The superMIGHTEE project
combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre
Array (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep
images at several $\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5
GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the
initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum
images covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in
the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source
catalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The
redshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\sim4$ with a median value of
$z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with
the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral
properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated
population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities
of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population
exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy
injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten
significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with
peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release.
Subsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image
cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE
ultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of
active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09012v1" target="_blank"><h2>Decays and annihilation of galactic dark matter: determine $D$-, $J_s$-,

using photometry and spectroscopy from the large data set of the SDSS DR16
survey. From the SDSS-QSO catalog of quasars, we selected objects with 0.1 < z
< 0.35 and absolute magnitude M(r) <-21.3. For all these targets, we searched
for candidate companion galaxies that have a projected distance from the target
< 700 kpc and a radial velocity difference from the QSO DeltaV < 1000 km/sec.
We find that in 447 QSO at least one companion galaxy is associated. A total of
691 associated galaxies are found in these QSO fields. In the majority of them
there is just one associated galaxy but in few cases, many companions are also
discovered and in two cases the QSO is found in rich galaxy environments. The
possible contamination due to a chance projection of the companion galaxies is
found less than 5%. Based on the available data we expect on average to find
\sim2 associated companion galaxies for each QSO. A small fraction (13%) of the
companion galaxies exhibits [OII] emission lines as signature of recent star
formation. However a similar fraction (16%) of unassociated galaxies in the
same QSO fields show [OII] emission. This study suggests that there is no
significant link between the presence of these close companion galaxies or the
signature of recent star formation and the QSO nuclear activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09607v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of Multiply Ionized Iron Emission Powered by an Active

surround the surprising abundance of compact red sources, which show peculiar
continuum shapes and broad hydrogen spectral lines. These sources, dubbed
``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the
literature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive
black holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has
significant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of
the difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive
their rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide
signatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that
uniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we
report the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the
existence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the
first 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a
possible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant
Balmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the
absorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer
edge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the
center of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the
properties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs
-- one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on
scales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09069v1" target="_blank"><h2>Testing the effect of progenitor's metallicity on $^{56}$Ni mass and

metallicity of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor stars
($Z_{progenitor}$) translates into a 25% variation in the $^{56}$Ni mass
synthesized and, therefore, 0.2 mag difference in the observed peak luminosity
of SNe Ia. Previous observational studies used the currently-observed global
gas-phase metallicity of host galaxies, instead of $Z_{progenitor}$ used in the
model, and showed a higher scatter in the $^{56}$Ni mass measurements compared
to the model prediction. Here, we use $Z_{progenitor}$ of 34 normal SNe Ia and
employ recent SN Ia explosion models with various configurations to cover the
observed $^{56}$Ni mass range. Unlike previous studies, our sample covers the
$Z_{progenitor}$ range, where most of the $Z_{progenitor}$ effect occurs.
Linear regression returns a slope of 0.02+-0.03, which is the opposite trend to
the analytical model, but at at low statistical significance level. We find
that comparing our sample with SN Ia explosion models on the
$Z_{progenitor}$--$^{56}$Ni mass diagram allows us to constrain the progenitor
scenarios. We also explore other chemical composition indicators. For
$(Fe/H)_{progenitor}$, our sample follows the trend predicted by the analytical
models, but at a low significance level. Noticeably, $(\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$
shows the opposite trend and a clear gap. When we split the sample at
$(\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$ = 0.35 $(\alpha/Fe)_{\odot}$, we find a 3$\sigma$
difference in the weighted-means of the $^{56}$Ni mass. Lastly, SNe Ia in
different $Z_{progenitor}$ groups show a difference of 0.14+-0.09 mag in the
standardized luminosity. The present work highlights a holistic approach (from
the progenitor star to the explosion with SN Ia and host galaxy observational
data) to understand the underlying physics of SNe Ia for more accurate and
precise cosmology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08891v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Extremely-High Velocity Outflow in SMSS J2157-3602, the most luminous

most luminous ($L\rm_{Bol}$ $\sim$ 2.29 $\times$ 10$^{48}$ erg/s) QSO, SMSS
J2157-3602, at z=4.692. Combined XSHOOTER and NIRES observations reveal that
the EHVO reaches a maximum velocity of v$_\mathrm{max} \sim 0.13c$ and persists
over rest-frame timescales of a few months to one year. SMSS J2157-3602 also
exhibits one of the highest balnicity index discovered in an EHVO so far. In
addition, the blueshifted CIV emission traces a high-velocity
(v$\rm_{CIV}^{50}\sim$ 4660 km/s) outflow from the broad-line region. Thanks to
an XMM-Newton observation, we also discover the X-ray weak nature of this QSO,
which likely prevents the overionization of the innermost disk atmosphere and
facilitates the efficient launch of the detected EHVO and BLR winds. The
extraordinary luminosity of SMSS J2157-3602 and the extreme velocity of the
EHVO make it a unique laboratory for testing AGN driven feedback under extreme
conditions. Current uncertainties on the outflow's location and column density
strengthen the case for dedicated follow-up, which will be essential to assess

environments via their characteristic dispersion and rotation (RM) measures
that encode information about the ionized gas traversed by the FRB sightlines.
In this work, we analyse observed RM measured for 14 localized FRBs at $0.05
\lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, to infer total magnetic fields in various galactic
environments. Additionally, we calculate $f_{\rm gas}$ - the average fraction
of halo baryons in the ionized CGM. We build a spectroscopic dataset of FRB
foreground galaxy halos, acquired with VLT/MUSE and FLIMFLAM survey. We develop
a novel Bayesian algorithm and use it to correlate the individual intervening
halos with the observed RM. This approach allows us to disentangle the magnetic
fields present in various environments traversed by the FRB. Our analysis
yields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in
the ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground
galaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is
$B_{\rm host}^{\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\mu{\rm G}$. Additionally, we
place upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\rm
host}^{\rm halo} < 4.81\mu{\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos,
$B_{\rm f/g}^{\rm halo} < 4.31\mu{\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average
fraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \lesssim \log_{10} \left( M_{\rm halo} /
M_{\odot}\right) \lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We
find that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with
previous measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs
and have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or
FRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of
RM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09011v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Hubble Arp Galaxy Survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Julianne J.

striking examples of galaxies that defy these expectations, making them useful
targets for studying the astrophysics that controls dramatic, but short-lived,
episodes of disequilibrium that mark galaxies' evolution. In this paper, we
greatly expand the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of galaxies
drawn from the Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs. We present new optical F606W images

the Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) wide field of view. Essentially none of
the sample had been previously observed with Hubble. The resulting images
display rich morphologies, revealing a variety of massive stars, HII regions,
stellar clusters, dust lanes, tidal tails, backlit galaxies, and occasional
chance superpositions. We provide a pedagogical guide for interpreting
highly-resolved optical galaxy images, which has general application beyond
this atlas. The atlas images also provide a superb starting point for more
detailed studies with high-resolution imaging in other wavelengths, and
spectroscopy to track kinematics and the interstellar medium (ISM). Areas of
obvious scientific relevance include feedback and star formation in merging and

cosmic time, honing in on the role played by both intrinsic and environmental
mechanisms at different epochs. In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first
wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work
provides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We
investigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass
satellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and
EAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to
separate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the
best parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest
classification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest
classification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of
quiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching
of low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs.
Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched
fraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is
strong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in
EAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations
rests in the mass threshold analysis. While IllustrisTNG predicts the existence
of environmentally quenched satellites visible within the survey limits of
MOONRISE, EAGLE does not. Hence, MOONRISE will provide critical data that is
needed to evaluate current models, and constrain future models, of quenching
processes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08874v1" target="_blank"><h2>Characterizing Supernovae Host Galaxies with FrankenBlast: A Scalable

FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ~half of which are
spectroscopically-classified, and are able to constrain host properties for
9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star
formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between
spectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we
determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to
misclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We
further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample
also force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the
spectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are
redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between
spectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily
trace $M_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on
$M_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and
Ib/c, and SNe Ia more $M_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the
difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that
SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M_*$ and more evolved environments
for the right conditions for progenitor formation. All data products and
FrankenBlast are publicly available, along with a developing FrankenBlast
version intended for Rubin Observatory science products.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09341v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detection of colour variations from gravitational microlensing

are chromatic, i.e. they depend on the applied filter band. Comparison with
microlensing simulations allows us to infer properties of the accretion disk.
We determine the R and V band light curves of the four images of HE0435-1223
from 79 and 80 epochs respectively, taken from 2014 to 2024 at the Las Cumbres
Observatory using difference imaging analysis. We consider difference light
curves to remove the intrinsic quasar variability. This reveals a prominent
long-term chromatic microlensing event in image B. We use microlensing light
curve simulations with both Gaussian and standard thin accretion disk
brightness profiles to analyse this signal. The particularly strong signal
observed in image B of HE0435-1223 makes it possible to detect a size ratio of
the accretion disk in the R band compared to the V band of
$1.24^{+0.08}_{-0.20}$ and $1.42^{+0.11}_{-0.22}$ for the Gaussian and the thin
disk model, respectively. These values are in agreement with standard thin disk
theory. For the absolute size we find large disk half-light radii of around 0.7
to 1.0 Einstein radii with an uncertainty of about 0.6 dex (depending on the
filter bands and the models). Finally, our calculations show that image B
undergoes caustic crossings about once per year.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09426v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gas-rich dwarf galaxy multiples in the Apertif HI survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  B.

can ignite or temporarily suppress star formation in dwarfs and can lead to
dwarf mergers. However, the frequency and impact of dwarf encounters remain
poorly constrained due to limitations of spectroscopic studies, e.g.
surface-brightness incompleteness of optical studies and poor spatial
resolution of single-dish neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys. We aim to quantify the
frequency of isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxy multiples using the untargeted,
interferometric Apertif HI survey and study the impact of the interaction on
star formation rates of galaxies as a function of the on-sky separation. Our
parent dwarf sample consists of 2481 gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses 10^6
< M_* / M_Sun < 5*10^9, for which we identify close companions based on
projected separation (r_p) and systemic velocity difference (Del_V_sys). We
explore both constant thresholds for r_p and Del_V_sys corresponding to 150 kpc
and 150 km/s on all galaxies in our sample, and mass-dependent thresholds based
on a stellar-to-halo mass relation. We find the average number of companions
per dwarf in our sample to be 13% (20%) when considering mass-dependent
(constant) thresholds. In the stellar mass regime of 2*10^8 < M_* / M_Sun <
5*10^9, we find a three times higher frequency (11.6%) of dwarf companions than
previously determined from optical spectroscopic studies, highlighting the
power of HI for finding dwarf multiples. Furthermore, we find evidence for an
increase in star formation rates (SFRs) of close dwarf galaxy pairs of galaxies
with similar stellar masses.</p></br></body>
