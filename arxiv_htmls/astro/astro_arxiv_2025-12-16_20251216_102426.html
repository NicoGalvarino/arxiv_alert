We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Our results demonstrate that viable phantom-crossing solutions exist without conformal coupling, motivating future full Bayesian analyses of this model class with non-parametric EFT priors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13688v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identification of periodicities with arbitrary shapes in AGN light curves</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lorenzo Bertassi, Maria Charisi, Riccardo Buscicchio, Fabio Rigamonti, Jessie Runnoe, Massimo Dotti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 14 figures, submitted to A&A<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), quasar (abstract), time-domain (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Massive black hole binaries are expected to be observable as periodic AGN in time-domain photometric surveys. Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13681v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bridging Simulations and EFT: A Hybrid Model of the Lyman-Alpha Forest Field</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Roger de Belsunce, Boryana Hadzhiyska, Mikhail M.

The statistical power of the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) demands precise theoretical tools to model the Lya forest. We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k <= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13679v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconstructing spatially-varying multiplicative bias for Stage IV weak lensing galaxy surveys with a quadratic estimator</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Konstantinos Tanidis, David Alonso, Lance Miller, Joachim Harnois-Déraps<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 6 figures. To be submitted to MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a quadratic estimator that detects and reconstructs spatially-varying multiplicative ($m-$) bias in weak lensing shear measurements, by exploiting the $EB$ mode coupling that it generates. The method combines $E$ and $B$ modes with inverse-variance weights, to yield an unbiased reconstruction of $m(\boldsymbolθ)$ to first order. We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\sim 1^\circ\times1^\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\sim5\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$σ$ level, after stacking between $\sim400$ and $\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\sim2800$ and $\sim7600$ for $1\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias. These results demonstrate that percent-level, spatially-varying $m-$bias can be detected at high significance, enabling diagnosis and mitigation in the Stage IV weak lensing era.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13633v1" target="_blank"><h2>A post-inflationary kinetic axion</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Enrico Morgante, Riccardo Natale<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages + appendix<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel realization of axion kinetic misalignment, triggered by a Hubble-induced phase transition during a post-inflationary stiff (kination) era. A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $Φ$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|Φ|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13578v1" target="_blank"><h2>Leptonic and Hadronic Models of High-energy Nebula Around V4641 Sgr</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Maksim Kleimenov, Andrii Neronov, Foteini Oikonomou, Dmitri Semikoz<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8 pages, 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), quasar (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A prominent, 200-pc-scale high-energy nebula surrounding the microquasar V4641~Sgr is the brightest known gamma-ray source in the Southern sky at $E > 100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13569v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the X-ray Secrets of Fermi-detected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies with XMM-Newton Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Suvas Chandra Chaudhary, Raj Prince, Brian van Soelen, I.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray timing and spectral variability of 16 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies detected by Fermi-LAT, based on 29 epochs of XMM-Newton observations. A moderate intraday flux variability is observed throughout the sample, with fractional variability ranging from 5 to 16\%. The temporal study of 1H\,0323+342 reveals a distinctive turnover timescale in structure functions, along with notable variations in flux and power spectral density slopes. The hardness ratio in some epochs demonstrates a clear trend of softer-when-brighter. The X-ray spectra of 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, RGB J1644+263, PKS 1502+036, and J1246+0238 are well fitted by a power-law + blackbody model, suggesting a bright disk along with a jet, and J1222+0413 is fitted by broken power-law, while the remaining sources are well fitted by a power-law model revealing the non-thermal domination. The X-ray luminosity exhibits a strong correlation with $γ$-ray and disk luminosity, and a strong correlation with the jet power, suggesting a close coupling of disk and jet. Additionally, we have found an anti-correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the X-ray luminosity, as well as with the FWHM of H$β$ line, indicating a complex interaction between the central engine, jet activity, and the accretion disk in these sources.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13544v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Adam Smith, Maria Mylova, Carsten van de Bruck, C.

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $Λ$CDM cosmology, with the $χ^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3σ$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13498v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-Method Timing of Transient Radio Pulsars with the GBT350 and GBNCC Surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> E.

These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13486v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolving Galaxy Nuclei and Compact Stellar Systems as Engines of Galaxy Evolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Julia Lamprecht, Izzy L.

We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime.

This is common practice in simulations of galaxy formation in which following the non-equilibrium abundances of additional elements is computationally expensive. We define the $\mathrm{H}_2$ excess as the shift in density of the \ion{H}{I}-$\mathrm{H}_2$ transition in the reduced network compared to the full chemical network (30 elements). The strength of the $\mathrm{H}_2$ excess generally increases both with temperature and metallicity, is largely independent of the radiation field strength, and persists across a large range of assumed shielding column densities. For warm gas, with $T\approx1000~\mathrm{K}$, the HI-$\mathrm{H}_2$ transition is shifted by up to 1 dex to lower densities in primordial chemistry networks already for extremely low metallicities ($Z\geq 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$). We confirm our earlier findings that missing reactions with oxygen are largely responsible for this $\mathrm{H}_2$ excess. A reduced chemical network of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen recovers the molecular hydrogen fractions from a full network and we therefore recommend to include destruction of molecular hydrogen by oxygen in a minimal chemical network for accurate molecular hydrogen abundances.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13408v1" target="_blank"><h2>Three-dimensional numerical simulations of neutron star cores in the two-fluid MHD approximation: simple configurations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrei Igoshev, Nicolás A.

We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13389v1" target="_blank"><h2>The PAU Survey: Uncovering the connection between intrinsic and observed galaxy properties using symbolic regression</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Adarsh Kumar, Carlton M.

We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ due to scatter. Our approach offers a fast, transparent alternative to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy for the bulk of the galaxy population.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13382v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA view on the nature of the compact VLA continuum sources in the massive young stellar object G25.65+1.05</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> N.

To investigate the nature of compact continuum sources that have been previously identified in this region, we analyzed 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular line emission. The central millimeter peak MM1 coincides with the centimeter source VLA 2, has a complex molecular spectrum, and is identified as a hot molecular core. Molecular emission of SiO and CH3CN in the vicinity of MM1 reveals kinematics consistent with wide-angle outflow structures and a possible rotating disk in the source. VLA sources 1A, 1B, and 3 are lacking compact millimeter counterparts and trace shocked regions where the outflow interacts with the surrounding material. In particular, VLA 1A, the site of H2O maser super flares, is interpreted as a shock interface that exhibits developed turbulent movements seen in the SiO molecular line. The observed turbulence creates conditions required for H2O maser action, directly linking the nature of VLA 1A to the origin of the H2O maser super flares.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13353v1" target="_blank"><h2>Super-resolving Herschel -- a deep learning based deconvolution and denoising technique</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dennis Koopmans, Lingyu Wang, Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Antonio La Marca, Matthieu Bethermin, Laura Bisigello, Zhen-Kao Gao, Claudia del P.

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $μ$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$μ$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$μ$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.
  We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $μ$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\lesssim$ 1" vs 12" pixel scale). Reliability is $\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $μ$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13345v1" target="_blank"><h2>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$β$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,Å\,, broad H$β$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Shulei Cao, Amit Kumar Mandal, Michal Zajaček, Bharat Ratra<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to PRD.

Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$β$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$β$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$β$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,Å\,, broad H$β$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,Å\, and the broad H$β$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13296v1" target="_blank"><h2>HALO I: Photometric continuum reverberation mapping of Fairall~9</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Amit Kumar Mandal, Francisco Pozo Nuñe, Vikram Kumar Jaiswal, Mohammad Hassan Naddaf, Bożena Czerny, Swayamtrupta Panda, Paulina Karczmarek, Grzegorz Pietrzy\' nski, Shivangi Pandey, B.

Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall~9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $τ_λ \propto λ^β$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13261v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on dark matter annihilation from a nearby subhalo candidate</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ben-Yang Zhu, Yun-Feng Liang, Xiaoyuan Huang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 2figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A recent analysis of pulsar timing data has reported evidence for a massive ($\sim 6 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$) dark matter subhalo located only $\sim 0.8$ kpc from Earth. This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\sim 10^{23}\,{\rm GeV^2\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\bar{b}$ and $τ^+τ^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13258v1" target="_blank"><h2>APOGEE physical properties of globular cluster tidal tails</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> André E.

I exploited the APOGEE DR17 data base and selected highly confident tidal tails members of 17 Milky Way globular clusters, for which the above four properties were computed for the first time. From all possible paired property combinations, I found that $σ$$_{\rm V_{LOS}}$ and $σ$$_{\rm V_{Tan}}$ resulted to be highly correlated, nearly to the identity relationship. This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13254v1" target="_blank"><h2>Non-detection of J1407b in ALMA Band 7 Observations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Pamela Klaassen, Matthew Kenworthy, Eric Mamajek, Nienke van der Marel, Michiel Min, Amaury Triaud, Antonion Hales<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 3 pages, 1 figure.

Our knowledge of the dust properties is nevertheless incomplete, especially regarding the dense star-forming clouds. The aim is to study dust evolution in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) and how uncertainty regarding dust properties affects estimates of the radiation field and the cloud mass. We constructed three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) models to fit the far-infrared (FIR) observations of dust emission in the OMC-3 field and used near-infrared (NIR) extinction measurements as additional constraints. We examined fits to the dense star-forming filaments and to the surrounding cloud, including some tests with spatial dust property variations.The 160-250 $μ$m observations of dust emission could be fitted moderately well with any of the dust models tested, but few models are consistent with the measured NIR extinction. The best match to observations is found with dust models such as the THEMIS model of large porous grains, with or without ice mantles, and with mean grain sizes up to ~ 0.3$μ$m. The flattening of the NIR extinction curve excludes larger grain sizes, except possibly in the central ridge. Compared to models of lower column density clouds, the results were relatively insensitive to the line-of-sight (LOS) cloud size and the spectral shape of the heating radiation field. In addition, the effect of embedded stars remained very localised in OMC-3. The results suggest that the dust in the OMC-3 region is evolved with a grain of average size $a$=0.1-0.3 $μ$m, potentially with ice mantles.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13182v1" target="_blank"><h2>The First X-Ray Polarimetry of an Eclipsing Low-Mass X-Ray Binary: Serendipitous IXPE Observation of AX J1745.6-2901</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Romana Mikušincová, Lorenzo Marra, Hemanth Manikantan, Stefano Bianchi, Fiamma Capitanio, Sudip Chakraborty, Raul Ciancarella, Enrico Costa, Nicolas De Angelis, Melania Del Santo, Sergio Fabiani, Riccardo Ferrazzoli, Vittoria E.

In order to discuss the physical origins of these variations, we incorporate gas- and dust-phase interstellar chemistry into galaxy-scale simulations with various baryonic physics including dust formation, evolution, and destruction, all of which are essential for the calculations of 400 interstellar molecule species. The new simulations can accordingly predict the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecular species such as H_2O and CO_2 ice within individual molecular gas cloud of galaxies based on gas density and temperature, dust temperature (T_dust), elemental abundances (e.g., CHNOPS), UV radiation strength (F_UV), and cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_CR) within the clouds. Since this is the first of the series of papers, we describe the details of the new simulations and present the preliminary results focused on the spatial distributions of H_2O, CO, CO_2, and CH_3OH ice species in a disk galaxy similar to the Milky Way.

We characterise the 2025 outburst using X-ray timing and spectroscopy from XMM-Newton and Swift (and a late-time NuSTAR observation), together with contemporaneous optical photometry from LCO, and compare the spin frequency with the 2022 outburst. Timing searches detect coherent pulsations at ~313.6 Hz with no measurable frequency derivative during the XMM-Newton exposure. Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \pm 2) kpc and ξ=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12995v1" target="_blank"><h2>The disk precession in a Be star-magnetar binary and its application to the rotation measure of FRB 20201124A</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ying-ze Shan, Wei-Hua Lei, Hao-Tian Lan, Shao-yu Fu, Jumpei Takata, Yuan-chuan Zou, Jia-xin Liu, Long-xuan Zhang, Tong-lun Wang, Fa-Yin Wang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Total of 12 pages, 3 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-15<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins. Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12985v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray Variability and Photosphere Evolution during Accretion Disk Formation in Tidal Disruption Events</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xiaoshan Huang, Maria Renee Meza, Sol Bin Yun, Brenna Mockler, Shane W.

In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12983v1" target="_blank"><h2>DREAMS.II.

To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M* and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M* and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M*, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z>8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z>8.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12958v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinematics of H I and O VI Absorbers: Insights into the Turbulence Driver of the Multiphase Circumgalactic Medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zhijie Qu, Hsiao-Wen Chen, Eliana Schiller, Jing Wang, Max Gronke<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 5 figures, 3 Tables.

Leveraging extensive public galaxy survey data at $z\lesssim0.1$, we construct a new galaxy sample based on the availability of background QSOs with far-ultraviolet spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\rm HI}$, from $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{13}\rm~{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{18}\rm~{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\rm OVI}\approx 3\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\rm~{cm^{-2}}$. We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\rm H}$ and $n_{\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\rm OVI}$-$N_{\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum.

Our sample consists of 393 MW analogs with stellar masses $10^{10.5} < M_{\star, \rm host} < 10^{10.9} M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.07 < z < 0.09$, all central galaxies of their own dark matter halos. Using photometric selection -- including magnitude, color, angular size, photometric redshift, and size-mass cuts -- we identify 793 satellite candidates around these 393 hosts. Our selection leverages two medium-band filters targeting H$α$ and [O \textsc{iii}] emission, enabling a nearly complete sample of star-forming, Magellanic Clouds-like satellites with $M_{\star, \rm sat} \gtrsim 10^{8} M_\odot$. We find that $\sim80\%$ of hosts have 0-3 massive satellites, and $13\pm4\%$ have two satellites (similar to the MW). Satellite abundance correlates with total stellar mass, and we provide significantly improved statistics for the most massive satellites at $\log_{10}[M_{\star, \rm sat}/M_{\odot}] \gtrsim 10$. The completeness-corrected radial distribution is less centrally concentrated than an NFW profile. In contrast, the Milky Way satellites are more centrally concentrated than the 50\% richest Merian systems, but are broadly consistent with the 50\% most centrally concentrated Merian systems. Our results highlight the power of medium-band photometry for satellite identification and provide a key benchmark for studying satellite quenching, environmental effects, and hierarchical galaxy formation.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12813v1" target="_blank"><h2>An Extremely-red, UV-bright, and Extended Galaxy at z~6 in PRIMER/UDS: An Early Massive Galaxy Caught Quenching after an Obscured Starburst?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nadara Hudson, Ryan Endsley, John Chisholm<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), dust (abstract), quiescent galaxies (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> JWST continues to reveal an astonishing number of massive quiescent galaxies at $z>4$, with number densities $\gtrsim10\times$ higher than model predictions. NIRSpec spectra imply that many of these systems underwent intense starburst episodes (SFR$\,\gtrsim300M_\odot$/yr), though direct evidence of such starbursts in the Gyr largely comes from exceptionally rare dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected in the far-infrared. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely red ($β=-0.6$) yet UV-bright (F115W = 26.0 mag) $z\sim6$ star-forming system selected as a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) over $\approx$500 arcmin$^2$ of deep NIRCam imaging. This galaxy (UDS_43065) shows photometric colors implying a prominent Balmer break and strong H$α$ emission, consistent with a dramatic burst of star formation (SFR$\,\approx\,500-1000\,M_\odot$/yr) occurring 5-10 Myr ago that formed 20-40% of its total stellar mass ($\approx1.5\times10^{10}M_\odot$) with little activity since. This galaxy is one of only two objects with $M_\ast>10^{10}M_\odot$ across our full sample of 813 $z\sim6$ star-forming LBGs, and the only galaxy with a confident extremely-red UV slope ($β>-1$). UDS_43065 is clearly resolved yet compact in F444W ($r_e=400\pm10$ pc) indicating a very high stellar mass surface density of log$(Σ_\mathrm{eff}/(M_\odot\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}))=10.25\pm0.13$ comparable to quenched $z\sim2-7$ galaxies. If the inferred star formation history (SFH) of UDS_43065 is corroborated with further observations, this object would seemingly represent a rarely-seen transitional phase between massive DSFGs and passive systems in the first Gyr, helping resolve the puzzling abundance of early massive quenched galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12754v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disentangling AGN Feedback and Sloshing in the Perseus Cluster with XRISM: Insights from Simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Elena Bellomi, John A.

To further explore this conclusion, we perform a suite of idealized, controlled simulations targeting the relative roles of merger-induced sloshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Our models systematically isolate and combine these mechanisms to predict observable velocity profiles and X-ray line shapes, providing direct comparison to XRISM and Hitomi data. We find that neither sloshing nor AGN activity alone can reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile; only their combined action matches the elevated dispersions both at the cluster core and outskirts. Power-spectrum analysis reveals distinct spatial signatures: sloshing generates large-scale coherent motions, while AGN feedback injects turbulence and broadens the velocity spectrum at small scales, especially in the core. By forward-modeling spectral line profiles, we show how these dynamics imprint unique observational signatures on X-ray emission. Our results underscore the necessity of accounting for both large-scale and small-scale drivers of gas motions in the ICM when interpreting high-resolution spectroscopic data, and provide guidance for the analysis of forthcoming XRISM observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12745v1" target="_blank"><h2>EROS light curve data base</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> C.

We present the first numerical study of particle acceleration in non-relativistic, magnetized, and purely shear-driven turbulence that includes full particle backreaction. Using two-dimensional MHD-PIC simulations with an initially uniform flow-aligned magnetic field and external stirring force, we demonstrate that sustained particle acceleration requires continuously driven turbulence, whereas freely decaying turbulence rapidly depletes its energy reservoirs and halts the acceleration. The acceleration mechanism operates through the systematic distortion of gyro-orbits by turbulent electric fields: acceleration phases extend the particle trajectory along the electric force, increasing the energy gain, while deceleration phases shorten the trajectory, reducing the energy loss. This asymmetry produces net energy gain despite stochastic fluctuations, with the mean energy change scaling quadratically with shear velocity, characteristic of second-order Fermi acceleration. Initially monoenergetic particles develop substantial non-thermal tails after the turbulence onset. For particles repeatedly crossing shear layers, their energization follows geometric Brownian motion with weak systematic drift, yielding a log-normal distribution. High-energy particles exhibit pitch-angle anisotropy, becoming preferentially perpendicular to the flow-aligned magnetic field as their gyroradii exceed the turbulent layer width. These results establish shear-driven turbulence as a viable particle acceleration mechanism, providing a general model for particle energization in shear flows.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12697v1" target="_blank"><h2>A parameterized equation of state for dark energy and Hubble Tension</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jing-Ya Zhao, Tong-Yu He, Jia-Jun Yin, Zhan-Wen Han, Rong-Jia Yang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a parameterized equation of state for dark energy and perform observational tests with the Hubble parameter measurements, the Pantheon supernova sample, baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESI DR2 data.

In terms of scalability, the multi-level PM spatial decomposition reduces the computational complexity to nearly linear. Precision is ensured by the optimized Green's function that seamlessly bridges gravitational interactions between multi-level PM and Particle-Particle (PP) calculations. The program design enhances per-core/node efficiency in processing $N$-body particles, while a fixed-point data storage format addresses memory constraints for large particle counts.

The constraints are given by using $χ^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\leq a<0.736$ ($68\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12516v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reconnection-Driven Turbulent Fluctuations in the Magnetically Dominated Collisionless Regime</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yue Hu, Luca Comisso, Lorenzo Sironi, Siyao Xu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, physics.plasm-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-14<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that converts magnetic energy into bulk flow energy, thermal energy, and nonthermal particle acceleration. Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12509v1" target="_blank"><h2>THRILS -- The High-(Redshift+Ionization) Line Search: Program Description & Redshift Catalog</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Taylor A.

Accretion solutions that involve the formation of shocks are particularly intriguing, as they are expected to naturally produce observable variability features. However, despite their theoretical significance, time-dependent studies exploring the stability and evolution of such shocked solutions remain relatively scarce. To address this gap, we perform simulations of transonic accretion flows around a black hole in ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework. Our simulations are initialized using boundary conditions derived from semi-analytical hydrodynamical models, allowing us to explore the stability of these flows under varying magnetic field strengths. The presence of magnetic fields modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow through magnetic pressure, and the resulting force imbalance induces oscillations in the position of shock front. Our results show that variations in the emitted luminosity arising from shock oscillations appear as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), a characteristic feature commonly observed in accreting black holes. We find that the QPO frequency is determined by the radial position of the shock front: oscillations occurring closer to the black hole produce frequencies of tens of hertz, whereas shocks located farther out yield sub-hertz frequencies</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12481v1" target="_blank"><h2>Readdressing the contribution of photonuclear reactions to the muon content of extensive air showers: a heuristic approach</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nickolay S.

These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12480v1" target="_blank"><h2>eROSITA-RU Tidal Disruption Events with Keck-I/LRIS: Sample Selection, Optical Properties, and Host Galaxy Demographics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Zirui Zhang, Yuhan Yao, Marat Gilfanov, Sergey Sazonov, Pavel Medvedev, Georgii Khorunzhev, Rashid Sunyaev, Vikram Ravi, S.

Our final sample contains 52 TDEs with redshifts of $0.018 \leq z\leq0.714$, comprising 41 gold (high-confidence) and 11 silver (lower-confidence) events. The vast majority (93\%) of gold TDEs are intrinsically brighter in the X-ray band, with $L_{\rm X,peak} > L_{\rm opt,peak}$. Among 23 events with detected optical flares, delayed X-ray peak is commonly observed. We identify transient spectral features in eight events, including six with prominent broad \ion{He}{II} $λ$4686 and/or H$α$ emission and two coronal-line TDEs. Host galaxy demographics reveal modest over-representation in green valley ($\times1.8$) and quiescent Balmer-strong ($\times5.3$) galaxies, significantly weaker than previous TDE samples, demonstrating greater diversity in star formation histories than previously recognized. Most TDE hosts exhibit suppressed star formation relative to the main sequence, consistent with X-ray selection biases against dusty star-forming galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12470v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploiting light coherence in astrophysics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vitalii Sliusar, Domenico Della Volpe, Benjamin Garcia, Gilles Koziol, Etienne Lyard, Nicolas Produit, Aramis Raiola, Prasenjit Saha, Lucijana Stanic, Roland Walter<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 4 page, 2 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect, discovered in the 1950s and further developed in the 1960s, was originally used to estimate stellar angular diameters through intensity correlations measured by spatially separated detectors. Further developments started from HBT experiments to exploit quantum bunching of photons in incoherent light sources played foundational role in the development of quantum optics.
  When the two detectors in an HBT experiment are co-located, typically implemented using a beam splitter, a zero-baseline intensity correlation is obtained, which after deconvolution of the detector response function, yields the temporal component of the second-order coherence function. Unlike spatial correlations, this function is independent of the source brightness distribution, or its size, giving direct insight into the properties of the source's emission process itself - photon statistics. Along with photometric and spectral information, the second order coherence function can be used to constrain the emission mechanisms and discriminate between thermal, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and stimulated emission processes. Evolution of the emission processes would likewise drive changes in the second order coherence. Light coherence information along with multi-wavelength observations, can become a complementary "messenger", carrying internal information about the astronomical source.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12466v1" target="_blank"><h2>Nyx-RT: Adaptive Ray Tracing in the Nyx Hydrodynamical Code</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nathan X.

Johnson<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-13<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Numerical methods for radiative transfer play a key role in modern-day astrophysics and cosmology, including study of the inhomogeneous reionization process. In this context, ray tracing methods are well-regarded for accuracy but notorious for high computational cost. In this work, we extend the capabilities of the Nyx N-body / hydrodynamics code, coupling radiation to gravitational and gas dynamics. We formulate adaptive ray tracing as a novel series of filters and transformations that can be used with AMReX particle abstractions, simplifying implementation and enabling portability across Exascale GPU architectures. To address computational cost, we present a new algorithm for merging sources, which significantly accelerates computation once reionization is well underway. Furthermore, we develop a novel prescription for geometric overlap correction with low-density neighbor cells. We perform verification and validation against standard analytic and numerical test problems. Finally, we demonstrate scaling to up to 1024 nodes and 4096 GPUs running multiphysics cosmological simulations, with 4096^3 Eulerian gas cells, 4096^3 dark matter particles, and ray tracing on a 1024^3 coarse grid. For these full cosmological simulations, we demonstrate convergence in terms of reionization history and post-ionization Lyman-alpha forest flux.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 49 papers (49 new, 0 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
