of the nearby Seyfert galaxy Mrk 509 with the use of a self-consistent warm
absorber (WA) model. We perform a physically motivated approach to the modeling
of WA as a stratified medium in constant total pressure (CTP) regime. Powerful
outflows are fundamental ingredients of any active galactic nuclei (AGN)
structure. They may significantly affect the cosmological environment of their
host galaxy. High-resolution X-ray data are best suited for outflow's studies,
and the observed absorption lines on heavy elements are evidence of the
physical properties of an absorbing gas. Our models allow us to fit continuum
shapes bounded together with the line profiles, which gives additional
constraints on the gas structure of WA in this source. In this work, we
benchmark and test the CTP model on the soft X-ray spectrum of Mrk 509. A grid
of synthetic absorbed spectra was computed with the photoionization code Titan
assuming that the system was under CTP. As an illuminating spectral energy
distribution (SED), we used the most actual multiwavelength observations
available for Mrk 509. We apply these models to the high-resolution spectrum of
the WA in the Mrk 509, taking into account cold/warm/hot Galactic absorption on
the way to the observer. CTP gas with $\log \xi_{0} \sim 1.9$, defined on the
cloud surface, fits the data well. A higher ionization component is needed for
Ne X absorption. The best-fit model is optically thin with $\log N_{\rm H }=
20.456 \pm 0.016$. The lines are non-saturated, and the CTP spectral fit aligns
with previous analyses of Mrk 509 with a constant density WA. The model
constrains the gas density, placing the WA cloud at 0.02 pc, consistent with
the inner broad line region and the thickening region of the accretion disk.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25383v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rapid bulge assembly in young galaxy disks at Cosmic Dawn</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anshuman Borgohain, Kanak Saha</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 33 figures, 3 tables, submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), quiescent galaxies (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to
reveal a surprising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first
billion years after the Big Bang, including indications of structural maturity
previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fundamental
questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy
morphology, such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly
identifying and resolving such structures at z $>$ 6 remains challenging due to
limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present a clear
and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z $>=$ 6,
demonstrating that distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to
emerge during this early epoch. Using multi-component light profile fitting, we
model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of galaxies with an
inner spheroidal (Sersic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These
systems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (~ 0.47) and central
stellar mass surface densities (~ 2.82*10$^{8}$ M$_{sun}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ) - values
close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their intense
central star formation rate surface densities (~ 1.26*10$^{1}$ M$_{sun}$
yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ), our results indicate a rapid building of inner stellar
mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that these early
bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent
systems observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed
through physical processes such as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or
bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics and external
interactions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25721v1" target="_blank"><h2>RIOJA. Young Starburst and Ionized Gas Outflows in a $z = 7.212$ Galaxy

SXDF-NB1006-2 at $z = 7.212$, as part of the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar
Origins with JWST and ALMA (RIOJA) project. We derive the physical properties
by conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our
target is a young (age $\sim2$ Myr) starburst galaxy with intense radiation
field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We
identify a robust broad component of [O III]$\lambda5008$ emission, indicating
the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few
hundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive
quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4-5$ identified by recent JWST observations. The
spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines
differs in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and
inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar
populations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of
$\sim0.2\,\rm{Z}_\odot$, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI
observations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at $z>6$ detected by
ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies
identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper
mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected
galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their
evolutionary pathways.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25678v1" target="_blank"><h2>Identification of Large-Scale (>100 kpc) Radio Jets in Narrow-Line
  Seyfert 1 Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  S. Umayal, Vaidehi S. Paliya, D. J. Saikia, C. S. Stalin, S. Muneer, Maheswar Gopinathan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> ApJ, in press</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive,
old elliptical galaxies. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the
identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young
active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets.
Among them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we
report the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s
with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published
catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed
sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We
suggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small
angles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were
identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of
the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency
Array, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source
J1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear
size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet
known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with
the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population
harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin,
propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25033v1" target="_blank"><h2>Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE: Bow Shock</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Guobin Mou, Xinwen Shu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A. Its previous work is about forward shock (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14715v1)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflow (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption
events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a
forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a
bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different.
To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted
two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the
spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on
their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to
obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results
for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to
that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak
frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The
radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The
combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing
significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases
producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights
the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas
on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to
reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24886v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dissecting the mass quenching in TNG50: Galaxy size determines the

quiescent galaxies are more compact than star-forming galaxies at fixed stellar
mass. In order to understand how galaxy quenching is related to galaxy sizes,
we performed a demographic study of 46 massive quiescent central galaxies with
stellar mass from $10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\rm M_\odot$ in the TNG50
simulation. We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic
nucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the
quenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by
the kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active
until strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially
resolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback
can only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this
size-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a
few Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after
triggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies
entirely. We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching:
a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a
long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the
entire galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25247v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of accretion disc-corona in the TDE Candidate AT 2019avd</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Haichao Xu, Xinwu Cao, Yanan Wang, Andrzej A.

show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days,
providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a
disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in
the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons
emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in
the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd
during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the
evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy
fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$,
which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much
shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum
in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and
black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be
a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a
stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical
AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column
density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution,
which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the
inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25647v1" target="_blank"><h2>Extreme equivalent width-selected low-mass starbursts at $z=4-9$:

$z=4-9$ and their role in reionization. Compact, low-mass galaxies with intense
optical emission lines are linked to elevated specific star formation rates
(sSFRs) and recent bursts of star formation. Feedback in these systems may
enable the leakage of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium. Using
JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys, we
compile 160 NIRCam-selected EELGs in the EGS field. These galaxies show extreme
rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs), with a median EW([O
III]+H${\beta}$)=1616\r{A} and EW(H${\alpha}$)=763\r{A}. They are low-mass
(median log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)=8.26) with high sSFRs (median 43
Gyr$^{-1}$), above the $z\sim6$ main sequence. UV slopes are diverse, with a
mean $\beta=-2.0$, and only 7% have extremely blue continua ($\beta<-2.6$).
Emission-line diagnostics suggest stellar populations as the primary ionizing
source, although an AGN fraction of 14% is found. These galaxies are efficient
ionizing photon producers, with mean log($\xi_{\rm ion}$ [Hz
erg$^{-1}$])=25.34, exceeding typical values at similar redshifts. Escape
fractions, however, are heterogeneous: 9% of EELGs show escape fractions $>$10%
for both Ly${\alpha}$ and LyC photons, while 82% lack detectable Ly${\alpha}$
emission. The median inferred LyC escape fraction is modest (4.4%) but enhanced
in super-Eddington systems with sSFR >25 Gyr$^{-1}$. The galaxies are extremely
compact, with a median effective radius of 0.49 kpc, and exhibit a recent
star-formation burst. Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate
surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line
strengths.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25156v1" target="_blank"><h2>A century of change: new changing-look event in Mrk 1018's past</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Thomas Dunn, Rebecca McElroy, Mirko Krumpe, Scott M.

Galactic Nuclei (CL AGN) Mrk 1018, whose second change we discovered as part of
the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). Collating over a hundred years worth of
photometry from scanned photographic plates and five modern surveys we find a
historic outburst between ~1935-1960, with variation in Johnson B magnitude of
~0.8 that is consistent with Mrk 1018's brightness before and after its latest
changing look event in the early 2010s. Using the combined modern and historic
data, a Generalised Lomb-Scargle suggests broad feature with P = 29-47 years.
Its width and stability across tests, as well as the turn-on speed and bright
phase duration of the historic event suggests a timescale associated with
long-term modulation, such as via rapid flickering in the accretion rate caused
by the Chaotic Cold Accretion model rather than a strictly periodic CL
mechanism driving changes in Mrk 1018. We also use the modern photometry to
constrain Mrk 1018's latest turn-off duration to less than ~1.9 years,
providing further support for a CL mechanism with rapid transition timescales,
such as a changing mode of accretion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24858v1" target="_blank"><h2>PEARLS: NuSTAR and XMM-Newton Extragalactic Survey of the JWST North

state hyperfine lines of hydroxyl (OH) -- the OH flip -- may trace gas that is
dynamically interacting with an expanding HII region, offering a new means of
probing such interactions. We explore this hypothesis using dedicated Jansky
Very Large Array (VLA) observations of three Galactic HII regions,
G049.205$-$0.343, G034.256+0.145 and G024.471+0.492, in 1--2 GHz continuum
emission, all four 18-cm ground-state OH lines, and multiple hydrogen radio
recombination lines. A Gaussian decomposition of the molecular gas data reveals
complex OH emission and absorption across our targets. We detect the OH flip
towards two of our sources, G049.205$-$0.343 and G034.256+0.145, finding
agreement between key predictions of flip hypothesis and the observed
multi-wavelength spectra, kinematics and morphology. Specifically, we
demonstrate a strong spatial and kinematic association between the OH flip and
the ionized gas of the HII regions -- the first time this has been demonstrated
for resolved sources -- and evidence from $^{13}$CO(1--0) data that the
expected OH component originates from the non-disturbed gas of the parent

phenomena that are also observed in Type-1 active galactic nuclei. In recent
years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN.
Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The
high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington
central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the
obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines
from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni
dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are
also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The
line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening
and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or
a slow wind at $r \simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI
Ly-$\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r
\sim 3\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein
the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated
outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction
is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk
that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the
strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible
explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.</p></br></body>
