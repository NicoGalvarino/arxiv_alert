first comprehensive view of the obscured side of star formation and black hole
accretion that dominates galaxy growth at cosmic noon. Around 90% of UV/optical
photons from young stars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are absorbed by dust
and reradiated in the mid- to far-infrared, where key diagnostic lines trace
accretion, star formation, and the physical and chemical conditions of
galaxies. PRIMA will conduct blind spectroscopic surveys out to $z \sim 3-4$,
enabling an unbiased determination of the co-evolution of star formation and
black hole growth with cosmic time.
  We simulate a 200 arcmin$^2$ blind spectroscopic survey with FIRESS to
measure star formation and black hole accretion rates for hundreds of galaxies
at cosmic noon. Follow-up observations will provide relative N/O abundances and
N/O-independent metallicities from multiple mid-IR lines. In its
high-resolution mode, FIRESS will probe feedback processes through P-Cygni
profiles, blueshifted OH absorption, and emission-line wings from highly
ionised gas.
  Beyond cosmic noon, PRIMA will pioneer rest-frame mid-IR spectroscopy of
galaxies during reionisation. Bright high-ionisation lines will constrain the
primary ionising continuum of luminous Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters and
low-metallicity AGN, revealing the conditions that shaped the first galaxies
and black holes. By bridging the gap between optical and radio facilities,
PRIMA will deliver an unobscured, end-to-end view of the processes driving
galaxy evolution from the earliest epochs to the peak of activity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05423v1" target="_blank"><h2>Another view into JWST-discovered X-ray weak AGNs via radiative dusty

galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. These JWST-AGN at high redshifts
are characterised by a set of peculiar properties, including unusually weak
X-ray emission. Here we investigate the apparent lack of X-ray emission in the
framework of the ``AGN radiative dusty feedback'' scenario based on the
effective Eddington limit for dust. We analyse how the boundary in the
$N_\mathrm{H} - \lambda$ plane, defined by the column density versus the
Eddington ratio, is modified as a function of the dusty gas parameters
(metallicity, dust grain size and composition). Low metallicity gas with little
dust content tends to survive against radiation pressure, and likely
accumulates in the nuclear region. We suggest that such dust-poor gas can
provide long-lived absorption and may lead to heavy X-ray obscuration, as
observed in early JWST-AGN. The blowout vs. stalling condition of the obscuring
clouds indicates that higher metallicities are required to eject heavier column
densities, while large columns of gas can stall in low metallicity
environments. Therefore the metallicity may play a key role in the AGN
radiative dusty feedback scenario. We discuss how other peculiar properties of
JWST-AGN --such as Balmer absorption features and weak radio emission-- may be
naturally interpreted within the same physical framework.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05417v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Light Echo of a High-Redshift Quasar mapped with Lyman-$α$

intergalactic gas around early quasars, carving out highly ionized bubbles in
their surroundings. Any changes in a quasar's luminosity are therefore
predicted to produce outward-propagating ionization gradients, affecting the
Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption opacity near the quasar's systemic
redshift. This "proximity effect" is well-documented in rest-UV quasar spectra
but only provides a one-dimensional probe along our line-of-sight. Here we
present deep spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) of galaxies in the background of a super-luminous quasar at $z_{\rm
QSO}\approx6.3$, which reveal the quasar's "light echo" with Ly$\alpha$
tomography in the transverse direction. This transverse proximity effect is
detected for the first time towards multiple galaxy sightlines, allowing us to
map the extent and geometry of the quasar's ionization cone. We obtain
constraints on the orientation and inclination of the cone, as well as an upper
limit on the obscured solid angle fraction of $f_{\rm obsc} < 91\%$.
Additionally, we find a timescale of the quasar's UV radiation of $t_{\rm
QSO}=10^{5.6^{+0.1}_{-0.3}}$ years, which is significantly shorter than would
be required to build up the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with
conventional growth models, but is consistent with independent measurements of
the quasars' duty cycle. Our inferred obscured fraction disfavors a scenario
where short quasar lifetimes can be explained exclusively by geometric
obscuration, and instead supports the idea that radiatively inefficient
accretion or growth in initially heavily enshrouded cocoons plays a pivotal
role in early SMBH growth. Our results pave the way for novel studies of
quasars' ionizing geometries and radiative histories at early cosmic times.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05866v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing baryonic feedback and cosmology with 3$\times$2-point statistic

uncertain and may bias cosmological parameters inferred by large-scale
structure surveys. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), through their dispersion measures
(DMs) encoding the integrated column density of baryons, offer a unique window
into the distribution of gas. In this work, we investigate the constraining
power of a 3x2-point correlation statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies. We present
the correlation formalism, derive covariance matrices and forecast
signal-to-noise ratios and Fisher parameter constraints. Assuming host galaxy
DM variance of 90 pc cm$^{-3}$, for $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs across 35% of the sky,
the angular DM power spectrum is noise dominated at multipoles $\ell \gtrsim
20$ ($\ell \gtrsim 100$), which implies that the analysis can be conducted
using arcmin-scale localizations, where the redshift distribution of the FRB
population can be modeled through the FRB luminosity function or FRB position
cross-correlations with galaxies. We show that while $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRB DM
correlations can constrain cosmological parameters at 40-70% (30-40%) level,
this is a factor of 2-3 (1.5-2) weaker than the precision attainable with
galaxy clustering alone due to shot noise from the limited FRB number density,
variance of the field and host DMs. On the contrary, feedback-sensitive scales
are not accessible in galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that combining FRB DMs and
galaxies auto- and cross-correlations in a 3x2-point analysis breaks
feedback-cosmology degeneracies, yielding 10-18% (7-13%) precision on
cosmological parameters and 3% (2%) constraints on feedback using $10^4$
($10^5$) FRBs. This work positions the 3x2-point statistic of FRB DMs and
galaxies as a promising multi-probe strategy, bridging the gap between
constraining astrophysical feedback models and precise measurement of
cosmological parameters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06476v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Shape of AGN-Driven Winds in the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 3516</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jacob Tutterow, Nicholas Ferree, D.

galaxies, which may affect the evolution of both the central supermassive black
holes and their hosts. In the case of NGC 3516, a nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy,
these AGN winds have historically proven difficult to disentangle from galactic
rotation. Using long slit spectroscopy at multiple position angles from the
Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Apache
Point Observatory Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi Object Spectrograph, we separate
these kinematic components by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H{\alpha}, N
II, H{\beta}, and O III emission lines along the slits. We present a biconical
outflow model that agrees well with the observed kinematics of the outflowing
gas in the narrow-line region (NLR). Our results indicate that the structure of
the O III emission is explained by dusty gas spirals in the galactic disk that
are illuminated by the ionizing bicone, which is viewed along one edge,
resulting in the complex nuclear kinematics. Our view into the bicone edge is
consistent with the multiple, deep components of ionized absorption lines seen
in UV and X-ray spectra of NGC 3516. The observed turnover in the velocity of
the NLR clouds matches that from a simple dynamical model of radiative
acceleration by the AGN and gravitational deceleration by the AGN and galaxy,
indicating they are the principal forces at work on the gas clouds. Finally,
the model launch radii indicate that the outflowing clouds originate primarily
from the inner dusty spirals near the AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06933v1" target="_blank"><h2>Black-hole mass estimation through accretion disk spectral fitting for

probe the most powerful end of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population. We
aim at determining the black hole masses and mass accretion rates of high-$z$
blazars in a common framework that utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
fitting method and the Shakura-Sunayev multi-temperature accretion disk model,
accounting also for attenuation due to neutral hydrogen gas in the
intergalactic medium (IGM). We compiled a sample of 23 high-redshift blazars
from the literature with publicly available infrared-to-ultraviolet photometric
data. We performed a Bayesian fit to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the accretion disk, accounting for upper limits, and determined the black hole
masses and mass accretion rates with their uncertainties. We also examined the
impact of optical-ultraviolet attenuation due to gas in the IGM. We find that
neglecting IGM attenuation in SED fits leads to systematically larger
black-hole mass estimates and correspondingly lower Eddington ratios, with the
bias becoming more severe at higher redshift. Our MCMC fits yield median
black-hole masses in the range $\sim (10^{8}-10^{10})\,M_{\odot}$ and a broad
distribution of median Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.04 - 1$).
Comparison with previous literature shows no clear method-dependent systematic
offsets, although individual mass estimates can differ by up to a factor of a
few. We also demonstrate that assumptions about black-hole spin introduce a
systematic degeneracy. This work is to our knowledge the first systematic study
to model the accretion-disk emission of a large sample of high-$z$ blazars
within a single, consistent statistical framework. Our results emphasize the
importance of accounting for IGM attenuation and of using uniform fitting
methods when comparing disk-based black hole estimates across samples.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06622v1" target="_blank"><h2>MARTA: The connection between chemical enrichment, feedback, and dust in

properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of
deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as
part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach"
(MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the
Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He
ii${\lambda}$4686 feature is consistent with a young (${\sim 5-6}$ Myr) burst
dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates
struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ${\approx}$ 4640 A.
Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we
disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental
abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local
star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of
the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized.
However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies
of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion
onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind
environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s)
H${\alpha}$ component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass
loading factor ${\eta \sim 0.2}$. Finally, we report the robust detection of O
I${\lambda}$8446 emission (among the first at high redshift), which we
interpret as originating from Ly${\beta}$ fluorescence and/or collisional

important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of $z>2$ massive

$JWST$ NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, $Chandra$ X-ray imaging, and ALMA
interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of
$12.9_{-3.1}^{+4.0}$ per cent. The removal of $HST$ data increases star-forming
galaxy contamination by $\simeq10$ per cent and results in a $\simeq20$ per
cent loss of candidates recovered from $HST$+$JWST$ data combined. We calculate
massive quiescent galaxy number densities at $2 < z < 5$, finding values three
times larger than pre-$JWST$ estimates, but generally in agreement with
more-recent and larger-area $JWST$ studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution
simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent
galaxy number density at $2 < z < 3$, however they still increasingly fall short at
$z > 3$, with discrepancies of up to $\simeq 1$ dex. We place 14 of our $z>3$

faint AGN in our sample, at a level of $\simeq50$ per cent, consistent with
recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of
maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent
quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the
evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical
filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05459v1" target="_blank"><h2>The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at

redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6 has a
spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc
model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above
1.6e7 Msun in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass
as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is
consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their
soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant
object at z = 14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a
similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine 3 further high
redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and GS-z11-1 at z = 13.86, 12.34 and 11.28,
again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed
the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of
massive black holes less than 440 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either
to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed
spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our
approach may be relevant to about half of that population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05434v1" target="_blank"><h2>What you see is what you get: empirically measured bolometric

that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the
rest-frame optical, with $L_{\rm bol}/L_{5100} = 5$, roughly half the value for
``standard'' Active Galactic Nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona,
UV-emitting black-body, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all
considerably sub-dominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well
below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that
dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten compared

accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing
are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of Little Red Dots. We

spectroscopic data and radio interferometric data, we report the discovery of a
pair of giant bubbles (with a projected radius ~ 5 kpc) of ionized gas emerging
from a highly inclined starburst galaxy NGC 6286, which is undergoing strong
tidal interactions with its close neighbor NGC 6285. The bubbles are manifested
by extraplanar soft X-ray emission with an X-shaped morphology, which is
tightly co-spatial with $\rm H\alpha$ line emission and partially coincident
with radio continuum. Low surface brightness diffuse X-ray emission can be
traced out to ~ 90 kpc from the galactic center, revealing the presence of an
extended hot gaseous halo. X-ray spectral analysis of the bubbles yields a gas
temperature of $0.70^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ keV, a relatively high value among known
galactic-scale bubbles in the local universe. An average energy injection rate
of ~ $10^{43}$ erg $\rm s^{-1}$ is required to inflate the bubbles within an
estimated dynamical age of ~ 6.4 Myr. The multi-wavelength properties of the
bubbles can be understood with the conventional superwind scenario, in which
disk/halo gas is swept up into an expanding, cooling shell by a hot tenuous
wind. The current starburst in NGC 6286 is energetically sufficient to launch
the superwind, although we cannot rule out the possibility of a more violent
AGN in the recent past as the driving source. Future high-resolution
spectroscopic observations will help to shed light on the origin of the
superwind and its role as an important galactic feedback process.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06677v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence for inverse Compton scattering in high-redshift Lyman-break

star-formation unbiased by dust obscuration. However, if radio observations are
to be used to accurately trace star-formation to high redshifts, it is crucial
that the physical processes which affect the radio emission from star-forming
galaxies are well understood. While inverse Compton (IC) losses from the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) are negligible in the local universe, the rapid
increase in the strength of the CMB energy density with redshift [$\sim
(1+z)^4$] means that this effect becomes increasingly important at $z\gtrsim3$.
Using a sample of ~200,000 high-redshift (3 < z < 5) Lyman-break galaxies
selected in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), we have stacked radio observations
from the MIGHTEE survey to estimate their 1.4-GHz flux densities. We find that
for a given rest-frame UV magnitude, the 1.4-GHz flux density and luminosity
decrease with redshift. We compare these results to the theoretical predicted
effect of energy losses due to inverse Compton scattering off the CMB, and find
that the observed decrease is consistent with this explanation. We discuss
other possible causes for the observed decrease in radio flux density with
redshift at a given UV magnitude, such as a top-heavy initial mass function at
high redshift or an evolution of the dust properties, but suggest that inverse
Compton scattering is the most compelling explanation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05400v1" target="_blank"><h2>A critical analysis of the recent OGLE limits on stellar mass primordial

This claim was based on the latest results from the OGLE microlensing survey

events expected from known stellar populations. In particular, their results
are completely inconsistent with the results of the MACHO survey which detected
a population of compact bodies in the Galactic halo which could not be
accounted for by any known stellar population. The discrepancy between the
results of these two groups has a long history, and includes problems such as
different choice of photometric passbands, quality of light curves,

sample of six Milky Way-like galaxies from the Aurgia simulation suite. We
quantify the enhancement in the annihilation rate in subhalos when including
the contribution from particles in the smooth component of the halo that
overlap with the subhalos. The enhancement in the annihilation rate scales with
the smooth component of the host halo dark matter density, and is evident for
subhalos over the resolvable mass range. Maximal enhancement factors are ~ 48
for p-wave models, and ~ 37,000 for d-wave models. For p and d-wave
annihilation models, ~ 13 and ~ 6 subhalos, respectively, across all six host
halos have emission from dark matter annihilation in their direction that is
above the foreground emission from the smooth dark matter component, and would
therefore be resolvable as sources. Such subhalos with the most significant
enhancement factors tend to be on the lower end of the mass range and located
closer to the center of the host galaxy. We provide a prescription to calculate
the enhancement for subhalos as a function of distance from the Galactic
center, and use this to examine the impact on dark matter limits from a couple
of example dwarf spheroidals. We show that, including the enhancement factors,
limits from individual dwarf spheroidals are at a cross section scale that may
approach those derived from the Galactic center.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04981v1" target="_blank"><h2>Deep polarimetry study reveals double ring ORC-like structures</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sam Taziaux, Dominik J.

interferometers, such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, have led to the discovery of new
classes of extended radio sources of unknown origin, including the so-called
Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). These phenomena are detected exclusively in the radio
continuum, with no clear counterparts at other wavelengths, making their
physical nature and origin a subject of ongoing investigation. To better
understand these objects, we study their radio continuum emission, spectral
characteristics, and magnetic field properties. In this work, we present a
radio spectropolarimetry analysis of a newly discovered ORC (ORC J0356-4216)
that exhibits a rare double-ring morphology. We use data from the MeerKAT
L-band and from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) at 943 MHz.
ORC J0356-4216 shows a symmetric double-ring structure with a diameter of
approximately 2 arcminutes, corresponding to a physical size of 668 kpc based
on the redshift ($0.494 \pm 0.068$) of its apparent host galaxy WISEA
J035609.67-421603.5. The radio spectra of both rings are steep, with spectral
indices of $-1.18 \pm 0.03$ and $-1.12 \pm 0.05$, and show no significant
substructure. Equipartition magnetic field strengths (assuming K0 = 1) are
estimated to be 1.82 microGauss and 1.65 microGauss for the respective rings.
The degree of polarisation across the object ranges between 20-30%, consistent
with a non-thermal synchrotron origin. The morphology and polarisation are
broadly consistent with large-scale shocks driven by powerful starburst
outflows. However, the high degree of symmetry, the coherent double-ring
structure, and the absence of internal substructure are features commonly
associated with relic AGN lobes, making this scenario particularly compatible
with the observed characteristics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05416v1" target="_blank"><h2>Macromodel-free flux-ratio prediction in quadruply imaged quasars with
  local constraints from lensed arcs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hadrien Paugnat, Tommaso Treu, Daniel Gilman</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Physical Review D</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), quasar (title, abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmological probe, providing a
direct tool to unveil the properties of dark matter (DM) on sub-galactic
scales. In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars
("quads") can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that
population-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM.
Current methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models ("macromodels")
of the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the
deflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop
complementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One
promising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar
host galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc
Basis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to
predict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted
flux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision
of $\sim 3-5\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller
uncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local
description of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular
structure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding
false-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly
simplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM
halos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the
local lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish
flux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of
small-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM
properties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions,
complementing the traditional macromodel based approach.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05637v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of the Physical Properties of the Most Massive Galaxies in

galaxies in clusters and their protohalos from $z = 4$ to $z = 0$. Galaxy
clusters and groups are identified using a halo-based group finder applied to
the COSMOS2020 galaxy catalog. We construct evolution chains from low redshift
clusters to higher redshift groups via the abundance matching method. The
region of protohalos corresponding to clusters is defined on the basis of a
characteristic radius. Our analysis encompasses a wide range of physical
properties, including stellar mass, luminosity, star formation rate (SFR),
specific star formation rate (sSFR), color ($g - r$), and stellar age. The
evolution trends of the most massive galaxies (MMGs) in higher redshift groups
and their corresponding protohalos are generally consistent. The stellar mass
of MMGs shows an increasing trend across the entire redshift range. By
considering the stellar mass growth as in-situ and ex-situ components, we find
that in-situ star formation is efficient at $z \sim 2$, while ex-situ accretion
becomes the primary growth channel at later times. At $z \gtrsim 2$, MMGs
undergo an intense star formation phase of approximately $10^{2}\ \rm
M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, but are generally quenched at lower redshifts. Stellar age
analysis suggests that most stars in MMGs formed at $z > 2$. Our results
present a coherent picture of MMG evolution across cosmic epochs, which is
broadly consistent with the current theoretical framework of galaxy formation
and evolution. Moreover, our work provides an intriguing way to trace galaxy
evolution through the construction of cluster evolutionary chains in
observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05403v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hydrogen-Alpha as a Tracer of Star Formation in the SPHINX Cosmological

their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able
to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshifts (z > 3) and thus measure
their star-formation rates (SFRs). However, using "classical" SFR(Ha)
calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift
galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty
star-formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha
luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha)
calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z > 3 with
minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of
star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with
JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations,
taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar
metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha)
calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean
squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.04 dex
and $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST
NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new
calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the
estimated cosmic star-formation density decreases by $\Delta\rho$(SFR)
$\approx$ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star-formation main sequence
increases by $\Delta$ $\partial$log SFR / $\partial$log M* = 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06594v1" target="_blank"><h2>The source of the cosmic-ray excess in the Centaurus region -

cosmic rays with energies $\gtrsim40\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is found in the direction
of several interesting source candidates, most prominently the nearby radio
galaxy Centaurus A. Naturally, Cen A has been suspected to create the
anisotropy - but very different scenarios have been proposed. This includes a
subdominant source contribution in combination with isotropic background
sources, as well as a scenario where Cen A supplies the whole cosmic-ray flux
above the ankle. Recently, it was suggested that the overdensity could instead
consist of strongly deflected events from the Sombrero galaxy. Thanks to the
recent development of several models of the Galactic magnetic field, it is now
possible to test these proposed scenarios explicitly. Leveraging the measured
overdensity direction, significance, angular scale, and energy evolution, we
place limits on the allowed signal fraction, the possible ejected charge number
and the strength of the extragalactic magnetic field between the respective
source and Earth. We find that the scenario of a subdominant source in the
overdensity region requires the charge number to be $Z\lesssim6$ and the
extragalactic magnetic field quantity $B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{nG}}$ to
be between $~1$ and $~100$. For the Sombrero galaxy to be the source, the
dominant charge number has to be around $Z=6$ with $1\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG}
\sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{nG}}\lesssim20$. We find that a scenario where all the flux
above $30\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is supplied by Cen A or M83 is possible for
$20\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{nG}}\lesssim30$ and a mixed
composition - explaining both the Centaurus region excess and the distribution
of the highest-energy events - however, another contributing source is possibly
required in the energy range $<30\,\mathrm{EeV}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06773v1" target="_blank"><h2>Disentangling Milky Way halo populations at low metallicities using

Feuillet</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Differentiating between in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way
halo is a challenging task. Various kinematic spaces are often used to identify
distinct accreted populations from the in-situ Milky Way halo. However, this
approach has limitations, especially at low orbital energies. To overcome this
ambiguity, elemental abundances are typically used to distinguish between the
populations. Yet, for many elemental abundance ratios, it remains difficult to
make this distinction at low metallicities. Aluminium abundances, on the other
hand, have been empirically found to be an effective discriminator, allowing
for the separation of accreted and in-situ populations in the Milky Way halo
even at low metallicities and low orbital energies. We aim to test the
discriminating power of [Al/Fe] using a well-studied sample of high-velocity
stars in the solar vicinity with high-quality spectra. With these stars, we
explore the [Al/Fe] ability to separate the in-situ from accreted stars and
test its limitations. We derived aluminium abundances from the Al I 3944 and
3961 {\rm \AA} lines for 45 stars observed in two ESO programmes, along with 11
stars with archival spectra. Aluminium abundances were determined using 1D LTE
and 1D NLTE spectral synthesis and line profile fitting. We confirm that the
low-$\alpha$ population systematically has lower [Al/Fe] compared to
high-$\alpha$ stars. Aluminium abundances, when carefully measured and NLTE
effects taken into account, are effective tracers of the chemical history of
halo stars. They provide an independent constraint on origin, complementing
$\alpha$-element abundances trends, and help us to disentangle subpopulations
within the accreted halo, especially in the metal-poor regime.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06955v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on Dark Matter Models from Supermassive Black Hole Evolution</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), IGM (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black

silhouette. The edge of the silhouette or shadow (alternatively, the apparent
boundary or the critical curve) is commonly determined by the presence of the
photon sphere (or photon shell in the case of rotating spacetime),
corresponding to the maximum of the effective potential for null geodesics.
While this statement stands true for Kerr black holes, here we remark that the
apparent boundary (as defined by Bardeen) forms under a more general condition.
We demonstrate that a shadow forms if the effective potential of null geodesics
has a positive finite upper bound and includes a region where photons are
trapped or scattered. Our framework extends beyond conventional solutions,
including but not limited to naked singularities. Furthermore, we clarify the
difference between the apparent boundary of a dark shadow and the bright ring
on the screen of a distant observer. These results provide a unified
theoretical basis for interpreting observations from the Event Horizon

observations of compact objects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06173v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mathematical Aspects of Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics:

rotating and non-rotating gas layers using numerical solutions of non-ideal,
isothermal MHD equations. The unstable magnetic field is either imposed through
the boundary conditions or generated by an imposed $\alpha$-effect. In the case
of an imposed field, we solve for the deviations from the background state with
periodic boundary conditions. We also include cosmic rays as a weightless fluid
which exerts a dynamically significant pressure and amplifies magnetic
buoyancy, known as the Parker instability. Without rotation, systems with an
imposed magnetic field evolve to a state with a very weak magnetic field, very
different from the marginally stable eigenfunction, where the gas layer
eventually becomes very thin as it is supported by thermal and turbulent
pressures alone. However, this does not happen when the $\alpha$-effect
maintains the magnetic field. Rotation fundamentally changes the development of
the instability. A rotating system develops nonlinear oscillations, and the
magnetic field direction changes even with an imposed magnetic field. We
demonstrate that the cause is a secondary $\alpha$-effect at large altitudes as
the gas flow produced by the instability becomes helical. The secondary
$\alpha$-effect has an anomalous sign with the $\alpha$-coefficient being
negative in the northern hemisphere, whereas the Coriolis force produces a
positive $\alpha$. The mean-field dynamo action outside the original gas layer
can also lead to a switch in the magnetic field parity from quadrupolar to
dipolar. Altogether, the magnetic buoyancy instability and the mean-field
dynamo action become separated as distinct physical effects in a nonlinear
rotating system. We show that none of the assumptions used in analytic studies
of the Parker instability is corroborated by numerical results.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06526v1" target="_blank"><h2>Metallicity differences between Type IIP and stripped-envelope supernova

evaluating environment metallicities of 79 Type Ib, 66 Type Ic and 93 Type IIP
by N2 and O3N2 strong emission line methods. The cumulative distribution
functions (CDFs) of the SN environment metallicities show Type Ib and Type Ic
SNe tending towards higher metallicity than Type IIP. We test the null
hypothesis that Type Ib/Ic/IIP progenitors are drawn from the same parent
population. There is no statistically significant difference between
progenitors of Type Ib and Type Ic SNe. However, when comparing Ib/Ic with IIP
SNe, the tests indicate strong statistical significance (significance level
better than 1\%) to reject our null hypothesis suggesting that the samples are
not drawn from the same parent population. The significance is even higher
(level better 0.1\%) when testing Type IIP vs. the combined Type Ib+Ic sample.
These results support a different physical nature of Type IIP and Types Ib/Ic

presence of multiple stellar components with distinct chemical and spatial
properties. In particular, the bulge hosts a bar structure exhibiting
cylindrical rotation, and a central velocity dispersion peak extending
vertically along the Galactic latitude. However, due to severe extinction and
crowding, observational constraints near the Galactic plane are sparse,
underscoring the need for additional data to improve the completeness and
accuracy of existing kinematic maps, and enabling robust comparison with
dynamical models. This work aimed to refine the existing analytical models of
the Galactic bulge kinematics by improving constraints in the innermost
regions. We present updated maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion
by incorporating new data near the Galactic plane. We combined radial velocity
measurements from the GIBS and APOGEE surveys with both previously published
and newly acquired MUSE observations. A custom\ -- developed Python\ -- based
tool, {\tt PHOTfun}, was used to extract spectra from MUSE datacubes using PSF
photometry based on DAOPHOT-II, with an integrated GUI for usability. The
method included a dedicated extension, {\tt PHOTcube}, optimized for IFU
datacubes. We applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to identify and
correct for foreground contamination and to derive new analytical fits for the
velocity and velocity dispersion distributions. Our analysis included nine new
MUSE fields located close to the Galactic plane, bringing the total number of
mapped fields to 57 including ~23000 individual RV measured. The updated
kinematic maps confirm the cylindrical rotation of the bulge and reveal a more
boxy morphology in the velocity dispersion distribution, while preserving a
well\ -- defined central peak.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06487v1" target="_blank"><h2>The full jet production cycle observed during fast state transitions in

bright outburst phases. The properties of these outflows change dramatically
between different spectral/accretion states. Collimated, compact jets are
observed during the hard state and are quenched during the soft state, while
discrete ejecta are mainly launched during the hard-to-soft state transition.
Currently, we still do not understand what triggers the formation and
destruction of compact jets or the launch of discrete ejecta. In this context,
finding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray
emission, such as its fast variability, would imply a major progress in our
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in
BH XRBs. Here we show that a brief but strong radio re-brightening during a
predominantly soft state of the BH XRB MAXI J1348$-$630 was contemporaneous
with a significant increase in the X-ray rms variability observed with NICER in
2019. During this phase, the variability displayed significant changes and, at
the same time, MAXI J1348$-$630 launched two pairs of relativistic discrete
ejecta that we detected with the MeerKAT and ATCA radio-interferometers. We
propose that short-lived compact jets were reactivated during this excursion to
the hard-intermediate state and were switched off before the ejecta launch, a
phenomenology that has been very rarely observed in these systems.
Interestingly, with the caveat of gaps in our radio and X-ray coverage, we
suggest a tentative correspondence between the launch of ejecta and the drop in
X-ray rms variability in this source, while other typical X-ray signatures
associated with discrete ejections are not detected. We discuss how these
results provide us with insights into the complex and dynamic coupling between
the jets and hot corona in BH XRBs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05580v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the origin of super-global spin-up trends of X-ray pulsars in HMXB
  systems</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Vitaliy Kim, Yerlan Aimuratov</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, accepted by ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Most X-ray pulsars in high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems exhibit both
global and local trends of spin acceleration (spin-up) and deceleration
(spin-down). Moreover, decades-long monitored objects display even more general
spin-up trends in their spin evolution and simultaneously demonstrate a
decrease in the orbital period, so-called orbital decay. Although obvious, this
general behavior leaves the open question of the energy source and the
mechanism of angular momentum transfer that ensures the neutron star's spin
acceleration. We hypothesize that the observed spin acceleration of X-ray
pulsars in HMXB (RLO and sgXRB) systems results from orbital angular momentum
transfer via tidal interactions with their massive companions. To study these
phenomena, we sample five well-studied objects with the longest observational
history of their spin periods from the population of known Galactic persistent
X-ray pulsars in HMXB systems. We obtain the spin frequency change from the
observational data and estimate energy losses for orbital decay and pulsars'
spin acceleration. We propose a new term of super-global spin-up trends, and
show that their observable values do not exceed theoretical upper limits
predicted within the scenario of orbital decay due to the tidal interaction
between the neutron star and its massive companion.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06859v1" target="_blank"><h2>Auriga Streams III: the mass-metallicity relation does not rule out

The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law
that has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. The small
scatter in this relation has been used to argue against severe tidal mass loss
in Local Group satellites. Aims. We aim to show that the observed scatter is
consistent with tidal mass loss seen in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in
simulations, using simulated Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga project as
an example. Methods. We analyze the stellar masses and mean metallicites for
all accreted systems in Auriga. We compute these quantities two ways:
considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the
bound progenitor. For both cases we fit the mass-metallicity relation and
consider properties that drive scatter about these relations. Results. Accreted
systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and
metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only
considering the bound progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation
has similar scatter ($\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Milky Way and M31
satellites ($\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have
experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their
total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation
can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites that are
substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Conclusions. The
small scatter in the observed mass-metallicity relation is compatible with
tidal mass loss. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict
which Milky Way and M31 satellites have experienced substantial mass loss.
These predictions will be tested with deep resolved-star observations from
upcoming facilities including Rubin LSST, Euclid, and Roman.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06922v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Ly$α$ and Continuum Origins Survey. III. Investigating the link

and escape of ionizing (LyC) emission is necessary to accurately model the
Epoch of Reionization, and identify the sources that powered it. The
Lyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS) is the first program to obtain
uniform, multi-wavelength sub-kpc imaging for a sufficiently large sample (42)
of galaxies observed in LyC to enable statistically robust studies between LyC
and resolved galaxy properties. Here, we characterize the morphology and galaxy
merger properties of LaCOS galaxies and investigate their connection with the
escape fraction of LyC emission $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. We find strong
anti-correlations between $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ and radii ($r_{20}$, $r_{50}$, and
$r_{80}$) measured in filters containing emission from star-forming regions,
and with the asymmetry and clumpiness in F150LP, the bluest filter in our
dataset, tracing UV continuum and Ly$\alpha$. We find that $\geq48\%$ of LaCOS
galaxies are visually classified as galaxy mergers. In LyC-emitters, $\geq41\%$
of the galaxies are galaxy mergers, LyC-emitting mergers have
$f_{esc}^{LyC}=0-16\%$. Galaxies robustly identified as mergers in LaCOS are
all at advanced stages of interaction, close to coalescence. The
$f_{esc}^{LyC}$ properties of mergers and non-mergers cannot be differentiated
statistically, and we only find significant difference between the two
populations in terms of their sizes, with mergers having larger sizes. We
conclude that $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ tends to be larger in galaxies with a small
number of compact, centrally-located, UV-emitting star-forming regions, that
merger represent a sizable fraction of LyC-emitting samples at $z\sim0$, and
that mergers at advanced stages of interaction can facilitate the escape of LyC
photons from galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05531v1" target="_blank"><h2>Comparison of Photometric and Spectroscopic Labels in Classifying Dusty

stars such as oxygen- and carbon-rich AGBs (OAGBs, CAGBs), red supergiants
(RSGs), and post-AGB stars (PAGBs), play a key role in the chemical enrichment
of galaxies. Photometric surveys in the Magellanic Clouds have cataloged many
such objects, but their classifications are often uncertain due to overlaps
between populations. We trained machine learning models on spectroscopically
labeled data from the SAGE project and applied them to photometric catalogs.
The spectroscopic model achieves about 89\% accuracy. Applied to photometric
labels, nearly all OAGBs are correctly identified, and YSOs have a 95\%
confirmation rate. In contrast, 16\% of CAGBs are reclassified as OAGBs, only
8\% of RSGs retain their labels, and fewer than half of PAGBs are confirmed.
Photometry is thus reliable for abundant populations with distinct signatures,
but spectroscopic confirmation remains essential for rare or overlapping
stellar classes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05442v1" target="_blank"><h2>The MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey - II. Catalogue of the diffuse

in 115 galaxy clusters in the Southern sky, using full-resolution (7.8") and
tapered low-resolution (15") images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy
Survey (MGCLS). In this MGCLS follow-up paper, we update and quantitatively
characterise the presence of diffuse radio emission and provide detailed
catalogue information on its radio properties at 1.28 GHz. As the MGCLS sample
is heterogeneous and was initially used as a test bed to reveal the scientific
potential of MeerKAT, the reported numbers are subject to this special case.
More than half ($\sim$54%; 62/115) of the observed MGCLS clusters present
diffuse cluster radio emission, with the total number of diffuse radio sources
or candidates detected being 103. Including candidates, we find that radio
relics are the most frequently detected diffuse sources in MGCLS at 53%
(55/103), followed by halos at 32% (33/103) and mini-halos at 10% (11/103),
with only 3% (3/103) being Phoenixes. The sizes of the diffuse radio structures
and candidates range from 55 kpc to over 2 Mpc, with $P_{1.28GHz}$ radio power
ranging from $10^{22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ to greater than $10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$.
In-band radio spectral index estimates reveal revived radio plasma emissions
that exhibit steep radio spectral indices down to $\alpha^{1656}_{908} \sim
-3.5$. Mini-halos and their respective candidates are detected mainly in
low-mass ($M_{500}$ $\leq$ 5$\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) and low-power
($P_{1.4GHz}$ $\leq$ $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) systems. We suggest the presence of
a statistically significant correlation between the 1.4 GHz radio power and the
cluster mass for mini-halo (and candidate) systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04857v1" target="_blank"><h2>Direct measurement of ISM proper motion with image registration</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid, and the Nancy Grace
Roman Space Telescope, will place unprecedented constraints on cosmology using
weak gravitational lensing. To fully exploit their statistical power, shear
measurement methods must achieve sub-percent accuracy while mitigating
systematic biases from noise, the point-spread function (PSF), blending, and
shear-dependent detection. The analytical calibration framework
(\texttt{AnaCal}) has demonstrated such accuracy but requires adding noise to
images, reducing their effective depth. We introduce Deep-Field Analytical
Calibration (\textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal}), an extension of
\texttt{AnaCal} that leverages deep-field images to compute shear responses
while preserving wide-field statistical power. We validate the method on
isolated and blended galaxy simulations with LSST-like seeing and noise,
showing it meets the stringent requirement of multiplicative bias $|m| <
3\times10^{-3}$ at 99.7% confidence. Relative to standard \texttt{AnaCal} on
wide-field images, this method improves effective galaxy number density from
$17$ to $30$ arcmin$^{-2}$ for simulated 10-year LSST data. Assuming deep
fields with $10\times$ the exposure of wide fields, we find the pixel noise
variance in shear estimation is reduced by $30%$ and the overall shear
uncertainty by $\sim 25%$. Finally, we assess sample variance impacts using the
LSST Deep Drilling Fields strategy, finding an equivalent calibration
uncertainty of $\lesssim 0.3%$. These results establish
\textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal} as a promising approach for shear
calibration in upcoming weak lensing surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06243v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence for Two SNe Type Triggering GRB 220101A: a Pair SN and a

solar mass CO core and a 2 solar mass neutron star binary companion. The binary
period being as short as minutes to hours. Recent results evidence that the
most energetic GRBs may have as precursors a sequence of two types of SN: a
pair-SN followed soon after by a more traditional core collapse. All this
appear to open the way to two new types of SNe: the Pair-SNe without a remnant
and a magnetized-rotating-core collapse leading to the formation of a pulsar.
We generalize our previous assumptions, here the possibility of fission of the
rapidly rotating CO core is examined. The role of the magnetic field of the CO
core are equally examined with the magneto-hydrodynamic associated process, all
the way to generate overcritical fields and e+ e- pairs. All this appear to
open the way to a new types of SN, much in line with pair-SN models and a
significant change from the initial non rotating models. The BdHN are

across a parameter space with \texorpdfstring{$f_{\rm FDM} \in [0.02,

neutral hydrogen fractions (\texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI}) for each

functions (PDFs) for both \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} and redshift
\texorpdfstring{$z$}{z} using Bayesian inference with the No-U-Turn Sampler

both central values and correlated uncertainties in \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm

each training epoch through direct incorporation of the multivariate PDFs
derived from observational constraints. We then compare the simulation outputs
to the machine-learned observational trends to identify the most consistent

\texorpdfstring{$f_{\rm FDM} \simeq 0.04$}{f_FDM approx 0.04} best match
current data, while lighter masses are strongly constrained. By integrating
simulations and machine learning in an uncertainty-aware framework, this work
explores the physics of the early Universe and guides future studies of 21-cm
