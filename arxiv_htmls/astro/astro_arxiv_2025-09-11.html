Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution.
Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most
promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high
detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows
traced by [O III] emission in z $\sim$ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to $\sim$8400 km s$^{-1}$
and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to $\sim$260% the
observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is $\gtrsim$6.6 times
larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z $\sim$ 1.5-3.5
(0/58) and z $<$ 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even
faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\lesssim$ 3, and
could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium
(IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is
$\sim$230$\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher
frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative
feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a
significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08055v1" target="_blank"><h2>The WISSH quasar project. XII. X-ray view of the most luminous

we studied the X-ray emission of the WISE/SDSS-selected hyper-luminous (WISSH)
QSO sample: 85 broad-line AGN with $L_{bol}>few\times 10^{47}\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at
$z\sim 2-4$. Our aim is to characterise their X-ray spectra and explore
relations between X-ray luminosity and other bands, comparing powerful QSOs
with the general AGN population. We performed spectral analysis for about half
of the sample; 16 sources were analysed via their hardness ratio; for the
others we estimated their intrinsic luminosity $L_{2-10\,keV}$. Only 8 sources
are undetected. We report a large dispersion in $L_{2-10\,keV}$ despite the
narrow distribution of $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\,\r{A}}$ and $\lambda L_{6\,\mu m}$
(about one-third of the sources classified as X-ray weak). This suggests
differences in X-ray corona and accretion flow physics between hyper-luminous
and less powerful AGN. X-ray photon index distribution is consistent with that
of lower-$z$, lower-$L_{bol}$ AGN, and does not depend on the Eddington ratio
($\lambda_{Edd}$) or X-ray weakness. Most WISSH QSOs with intrinsic absorption
estimates show little to no obscuration ($N_H \le 5\times 10^{22}\,cm^{-2}$).
Among the obscured sources we find blue QSOs without broad absorption lines
within the "forbidden region" of the $Log(N_H)-Log(\lambda_{Edd})$ plane,
typically occupied by dust-reddened QSOs and associated with intense feedback.
We confirm a correlation between $L_{2-10\,keV}$ and CIV line blueshift, a
tracer of nuclear ionized outflows. Multi-wavelength data and complete X-ray
coverage enabled the investigation of the disk-corona interplay at the highest
luminosity regimes. The broad distribution of bolometric correction and X-ray -
to - optical index suggest caution when using $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\,\r{A}}$ or
$L_{6\,\mu m}$ as direct X-ray proxy for individual luminous QSOs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08041v1" target="_blank"><h2>Uncertainties in the supermassive black hole abundance and implications

important observable quantity for the prediction and theoretical interpretation
of the gravitational wave background (GWB) measured by pulsar timing arrays
(PTAs). Due to the limited sample size of galaxies with dynamically inferred
SMBH masses, more readily measurable galaxy properties $X$ that correlate with
the black hole mass are used as labels (via scaling relations $M_{\bullet}-X$),
which can then be counted in a larger galaxy catalog to produce a measurement
of the mass function. Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass
function is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations
and galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the
characteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass
proxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both
catalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce
significant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance. In this work, we explore
measurements of the SMBH mass function using different mass proxies through a
set of catalogs with a number of redundant measurements between them. This
enables us to investigate internal inconsistencies that lead to discrepancies
in the final black hole abundance, while minimizing observational systematic
biases induced by combining disparate sets of measurements. We focus on 3
proxies: the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, K-band luminosity $L$, and a
combination of $L$ and radius $R$ defined by the fundamental plane. We show
that all three can be reconciled to some degree, but highlight the remaining
dependence on poorly-quantified systematic corrections between the scaling
relation catalogs and the mass function catalogs, as well as the potential
impact of selection effects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08448v1" target="_blank"><h2>Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas

proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high
redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the
mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life
of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels
the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment
stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the
cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for
sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar
progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We
estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF),
with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within
the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by
Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are
shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap,
well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123,
depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and
compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a
surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent
in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that
are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim
10^6{\rm M}_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that
proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have
generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm
M}_\odot$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08062v1" target="_blank"><h2>Discovery of a $z \sim 0.8$ Ultra Steep Spectrum Radio Halo in the

intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. However, their origin remains
unknown. Two main formation models have been proposed: the hadronic model, in
which relativistic electrons are continuously injected by cosmic-ray protons;
and the leptonic turbulent re-acceleration model, where cluster mergers
re-energise electrons in situ. A key discriminant between the two models would
be the existence of ultra-steep spectrum radio halos (USSRHs), which can only
be produced through turbulent re-acceleration. Here we report the discovery of
an USSRH in the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2337$-$5942 at redshift $z = 0.78$ in the
MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope 100 deg$^2$ survey. This discovery is noteworthy
for two primary reasons: it is the highest redshift USSRH system to date; and
the close correspondence of the radio emission with the thermal ICM as traced
by $\mathit{Chandra}$ X-ray observations, further supporting the leptonic
re-acceleration model. The halo is under-luminous for its mass, consistent with
a minor merger origin, which produces steep-spectrum, lower luminosity halos.
This result demonstrates the power of wide-field, high-fidelity, $\lesssim1$
GHz surveys like the MeerKAT-SPT 100 deg$^2$ programme to probe the origin and
evolution of radio halos over cosmic time, ahead of the Square Kilometre Array.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08040v1" target="_blank"><h2>COSMOS-Web galaxy groups: Evolution of red sequence and quiescent galaxy

fraction and red-sequence (RS) parameters in COSMOS galaxy groups from z=0 to

with AMICO in the COSMOS(-Web) field. Our study of the quiescent galaxy
population is based on a machine-learning classification tool based on
rest-frame magnitudes. The algorithm learns from several traditional methods to
estimate the probability of a galaxy being quiescent, achieving high precision
and recall. Starting from this classification, we computed quiescent galaxy
fractions within groups via two methods: one based on the membership
probabilities provided by AMICO, which rely on an analytical model, and another
using a model-independent technique. We then detected the RS by estimating the
ridgeline position using photometric data, followed by sigma clipping to remove
outliers. This analysis was performed using both rest-frame and observed-frame
magnitudes with rest-frame matching. We compared the results from both
approaches and investigated the $z$ and richness dependence of the RS
parameters. We found that the quiescent galaxy population in groups builds up
steadily from z=1.5-2 across all richnesses, with faster and earlier growth in
the richest groups. The first galaxies settle onto the RS ridgeline by $z \sim
2$, consistent with current evolutionary scenarios. Notably, we reported a rare
overdensity of quiescent galaxies at z=3.4, potentially one of the most distant
early RSs observed. Extending our study to X-rays, we found that X-ray faint
groups have, on average, lower quiescent fractions than X-ray bright ones,
likely reflecting their typical location in filaments. Leveraging the broad
wavelength coverage of COSMOS2025, we traced RS evolution over $\sim 12$ Gyr,
finding no significant trends in either slope or scatter of the ridgeline.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08035v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bright [CII]158$μ$m Streamers as a Beacon for Giant Galaxy Formation

protoclusters, challenge the classical bottom-up galaxy formation paradigm.
Giant elliptical galaxies at $z=0$ must have assembled rapidly, possibly within
few 100 Myr through an extreme growth phase at high-redshift, characterized by
elevated star-formation rates of several thousand solar masses per year
distributed over concurrent, gas-rich mergers. We present a novel view of the
$z=4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56 from sensitive multi-cycle ALMA dust
continuum and [CII]158$\mu$m line observations. Distributed across 60 kpc, a
highly structured gas reservoir with a line luminosity of
$L_\mathrm{[CII]}=3.0\pm0.2\times10^9$ $L_\odot$ and an inferred cold gas mass
of $M_{gas}= 8.9\pm0.7\times10^{9}$ $M_\odot$ is found surrounding the central
massive galaxy triplet. Like ``beads on a string'', the newly-discovered [CII]
streamers fragment into a few kpc-spaced and turbulent clumps that have a
similar column density as local Universe spiral galaxy arms at
$\Sigma_{gas}=20$--$60$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. For a dust temperature of 30 K,
the [CII] emission from the ejected clumps carry $\gtrsim$3% of the FIR
luminosity, translating into an exceptionally low mass-to-light ratio of
$\alpha_\mathrm{[CII]}=2.95\pm0.3$ $M_\odot$ $L_\odot^{-1}$, indicative of
shock-heated molecular gas. In phase space, about half of the galaxies in the
protocluster core populate the same caustic as the [CII] streamers
($r/r_{vir}\times|\Delta v|/\sigma_{vir}\approx0.1$), suggesting angular
momentum dissipation via tidal ejection while the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG) is assembling. Our findings provide new evidence for the importance of
tidal ejections of [CII]-bright, shocked material following multiple major
mergers that might represent a landmark phase in the $z\gtrsim4$ co-evolution
of BCGs with their hot, metal enriched atmospheres.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07527v1" target="_blank"><h2>TeV Emission in NGC 4278: Shock Energetics Insufficient, Compact Origin

from the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) NGC 4278.
Integral-field spectroscopy with MEGARA revealed ionized outflows on
hundred-parsec scales with kinetic power $\dot E_{\rm shock} \sim 10^{38}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, well below the TeV luminosity $L_{\gamma} \gtrsim 10^{41}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. The implied efficiencies, $\eta \gtrsim 1000$, are far above unity,
showing that shocks cannot account for the TeV emission. Contemporaneous
Fermi-Large Area Telescope and Swift data, consistent with a compact
synchrotron self-Compton jet component, favor a nuclear origin. NGC 4278 is the
first low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)/LLAGN of its class
detected at TeV energies, a benchmark for LINERs with outflows and a prime
target for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. I conclude that the TeV
photons arise from a compact nuclear accelerator, while optical outflows trace
larger-scale jet--ISM interactions that coexist but do not power the TeV

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear
disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These
molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\odot$
of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$
cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with
higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their
possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used
the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking
into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between
sensitivity and resolution.
  New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of
0.015\arcsec, equivalent to $\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\sim$ 15~Mpc distance.
The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas
near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc towards the NW from
the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus.
  The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has now a different position angle from
previous observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin
torus, with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple
geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations.
The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow
in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the
black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for
those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the
scatter is maximum.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08649v1" target="_blank"><h2>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM II. Cross-calibration of

physical parameters of the most abundant baryon components in the Universe. The
plethora of X-ray observatories currently operational enables a panchromatic
view of the high-energy emission of celestial sources. However, uncertainties
in the energy-dependent calibration of the instrument transfer functions (e.g.
the effective area, energy redistribution, or gain) can limit - and
historically, did limit - the accuracy of X-ray spectroscopic measurements.
  We revised the status of the cross-calibration among the scientific payload
on board four operation missions: Chandra, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and the recently
launched XRISM. XRISM carries the micro-calorimeter Resolve, which yields the
best energy resolution at energies above 2 keV. For this purpose, we used the
data from a 10-day-long observational campaign targeting the nearby active
galactic nucleus NGC 3783, carried out in July 2024.
  We present a novel model-independent method for assessing the
cross-calibration status that is based on a multi-node spline of the spectra
with the highest-resolving power (XRISM/Resolve in our campaign). We also
estimated the impact of the intrinsic variability of NGC 3783 on the
cross-calibration status due to the different time coverages of participating
observatories and performed an empirical reassessment of the Resolve throughput
at low energies.
  Based on this analysis, we derived a set of energy-dependent correction
factors of the observed responses, enabling a statistically robust analysis of
the whole spectral dataset. They will be employed in subsequent papers
describing the astrophysical results of the campaign.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07670v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Comprehensive All-Sky Catalog of 3345 Molecular Clouds from
