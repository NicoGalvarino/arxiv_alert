Spinoglio</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> MUSE (abstract), JWST (abstract), James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), ISM (abstract), feedback (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae
(SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in
narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by
shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition.
This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to
excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical
diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization
parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared
(MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi
Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC
5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the
inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical
lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II]
within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to
CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust
tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR
diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which
often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both
mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics
diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for
a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach
not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization
but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven
processes in AGN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14669v1" target="_blank"><h2>Vertical Structure of Interstellar Dust in the Milky Way</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  H. -L.

shaping star formation, altering observed stellar properties, and
redistributing radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Milky Way,
dust is concentrated in the Galactic disk and often associated with large-scale
structures such as spiral arms and molecular clouds. Here we present a detailed
analysis of the vertical distribution and substructure of interstellar dust
using a sample of approximately 23 million stars from literature with
high-precision extinction measurements. We derive three-dimensional dust
density profiles along various sightlines and fit vertical dust distributions
using both single and double exponential disk models across 12 Galactocentric
radial bins from $\sim$6 to $\sim$12\,kpc. We show that a two-component disk
model--comprising a ``thin'' and a ``thick'' dust disk--provides a better fit
to the vertical dust profile than a single exponential disk, as indicated by
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) comparisons. The thin and thick disks have
average scale heights of $81.0 \pm 6.7$\,pc and $152.0 \pm 7.0$\,pc,
respectively. Our results also identify significant dust substructures, which
align well with known spiral arms, molecular clouds, and star-forming regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14613v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical Enrichment of Isolated Relic Galaxy Mrk1216</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

evolution of the isolated elliptical relic galaxy Mrk1216 through X-ray
observations. As a red-nugget relic, Mrk1216 provides a rare window into the
early Universe, owing to its minimal interaction with the surrounding
environment. Using data from the XMM-Newton telescope, we model the X-ray
emission of its interstellar medium to derive radial temperature and abundance
profiles. We find that the central region exhibits an elevated [Mg/Fe] ratio
compared to typical early-type galaxies, consistent with a brief but intense
star formation episode during its early assembly-a hallmark of relic systems.
The nearly flat SNIa ratio profile ($R_{Ia} \sim 0.17$) extending to
$\sim0.42R_{500}$ supports an early-enrichment scenario. These results
highlight the importance of relic galaxies as benchmarks for studying early
galaxy evolution and chemical enrichment. Future high-resolution missions and
more advanced theoretical models incorporating more realistic initial mass
functions are needed to fully assess their implications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14316v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar velocity distributions in binary-rich ultrafaint dwarf galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Amery Gration, David D.

Izzard</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 12 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies are dominated by dark matter, the
distribution of which may be inferred from the kinematics of that galaxy's
stellar population. Star-by-star observations are available for the satellite
UFD galaxies of the Milky Way, making them uniquely good laboratories in which
to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales. However, the
kinematics of these galaxies are complicated by the presence of binary stars,
which alter the stellar velocity distribution. In particular these binary stars
increase the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, which is related to the
total galactic mass by the virial theorem. Without correctly eliminating or
accounting for binary stars we may therefore overestimate the masses of UFD
galaxies or even confuse globular clusters for UFD galaxies. Here we write down
the probability density function for the observed line-of-sight (LOS) velocity
of a stellar population containing both visual and spectroscopic binary stars,
which we then use to determine the effect of those binary stars on the observed
LOS velocity dispersion. For the coldest UFD galaxies the fractional increase
in LOS velocity dispersion is of order one and for the coldest globular
clusters is of order 100. However, if the stellar initial mass function is
bottom light, as it may be for UFD galaxies and globular clusters, then both of
these values increase by half a dex.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14983v1" target="_blank"><h2>HerS-3: An Exceptional Einstein Cross Reveals a Massive Dark Matter Halo</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  P.

which is gravitationally amplified into an Einstein cross with a fifth image of
the background galaxy seen at the center of the cross. Detailed 1-mm
spectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and ALMA resolve the individual images and
show that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have
similar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical
redshifts. The HST F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four
galaxies with a photometric redshift zphot~1.0. Lens models that only include
the four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By
adding a fifth massive component, lying south-east of the brightest galaxy of
the group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape
and orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is
detected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter
halo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an
infrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge-on. The serendipitous
discovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for
exploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic
evolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated
with the lensing galaxy group.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14715v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Production Mechanism of the High-energy Emission Line in the
  Brightest Cosmic Burst</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jieying Liu, Jirong Mao, Shao-Lin Xiong, Yan-Qiu Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> As a characteristic feature of the spectrum, the emission line carries
critical information on the underlying physics of the radiation. After
extensive efforts in decades, the first high-significant detection of a series
of emission lines evolving from 37 MeV to 6 MeV has been detected in the
ever-bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. However, the physical mechanism of the
entire evolutionary trend of the lines remains elusive. To provide a
self-consistent interpretation, we propose a novel scenario in which the
photons of the line undergo a radiation transfer process called
down-Comptonization after generation by the electron--positron pair
annihilation. By incorporating the gamma-ray burst dynamical evolution, we
systematically reproduce the observed evolution of the central energy, width,
and flux of the emission line and further impose stringent constraints on the
production of high-energy emission lines in general. Our study provides a new
direction to the research of extreme cosmic bursts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14487v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Mechanism of Episodic Gas Accretion to the Central Region of
  Spiral Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Naomichi Yutani, Nozomu Kawakatu, Takayuki Saitoh, Keiichi Wada</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (title), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We performed \textit{N}-body/SPH simulations of isolated spiral galaxies with
various bulge-to-disk mass ratios ($M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$) from 0.02 to
0.2 to investigate mass transport from galactic scales (10 kpc) down to
circumnuclear disk scales ($\lesssim$ 100 pc). Our analysis revealed these main
findings, (1) Gravitational torque from stellar spiral arms causes gas
accretion with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ along the gas spiral arms from
a few kpc to a few 100 pc scale. The density of accreting gas is a few 100
${\rm cm^{-3}}$, comparable to the gas arms. The pressure gradient force is
over an order of magnitude weaker than the stellar gravitational torque. (2)
Gravitational torque from barred structure causes episodic gas clump accretion
with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ on timescales of 10 Myr from kpc to a
few 100 pc scale. The densities of these clumps exceed 700 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, and
this accretion occurs along elliptical orbits with a delayed phase relative to
the bar potential \citep{wada1994}. (3) Episodic gas clumpy accretion is
important for galactic center instability, confirmed by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm
disk}$ = 0.02 but not by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$ = 0.1 and 0.2. This
difference occurs because in the bulge-dominated potentials, bar instability is
suppressed, and rapid gas clumps accretion does not occur. These findings
suggest that gas clump accretion events driven by bars could be a source of
high-density gas to the galactic center of the spiral galaxy, potentially
promoting temporary activity in the galactic center.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14473v1" target="_blank"><h2>JWST Photometry of Globular Cluster Populations in MACS0417.5-1154</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  William E.

z=0.443, reveals a huge population of globular clusters (GCs) and Ultra-Compact
Dwarfs (UCDs) primarily distributed around its single central giant galaxy
(BCG). We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W,
F115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in
radial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG
halo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5
x 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters
with comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from
other lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on
purely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many
Gigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We
show this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7
Gyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly
visible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population
with time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam
filters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an
aid to planning further studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14555v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stratified wind from a super-Eddington X-ray binary is slower than

blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray
binaries (black holes and neutron stars), and supermassive black holes. Some of
the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from
systems where radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the
inner disc ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$). These winds should be extremely fast and
carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive
black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism
linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies. Here we show
the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the Galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1,
which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This
Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint,
although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$).
However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of
thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc, than
with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner
disc. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion
flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for
the ultrafast ($v\sim 0.3c$) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a
supermassive black hole at similarly high Eddington ratio.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14206v1" target="_blank"><h2>Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of

galaxy formation and interaction histories. This paper is part of the LEWIS
project, an integral-field spectroscopic survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies
(UDGs) in the Hydra I cluster. We use MUSE spectroscopy and new VIRCAM $H$-band
imaging data to study the GC populations and dark matter content in four dwarf
galaxies. We retrieved line-of-sight velocities for all sources in the observed
MUSE fields. Since the spectroscopic measurements are limited to relatively
bright sources, we developed a multi-band photometric procedure to identify
additional GC candidates too faint for spectroscopic confirmation. GC
candidates were selected using a combination of photometric properties and
morphometric criteria. Additionally, the $H$-band observations were used to
constrain the stellar masses of the studied galaxies. Based on the
spectroscopic classification, we confirm one GC in UDG3, two in UDG7, and four
in UDG11, while UDG9 has no spectroscopically confirmed bright GCs. We identify
four intra-cluster GCs in the vicinity of UDG3 and UDG11, and one ultra-compact
dwarf with a radial velocity only $\Delta v = -85 \pm 10\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$
relative to UDG7, suggesting it may be bound to it. Considering completeness
corrections and accounting for possible contamination, from photometry we
estimate that the number of GCs ranges between 0 and $\sim40$ for the
investigated UDGs. Their specific frequencies suggest that three out of four
UDGs are either GC-rich, similar to those in the Coma cluster, or belong to an
intermediate population as seen in the Perseus cluster. Dark matter content
estimates, inferred from GC counts and stellar mass, indicate that these
galaxies are dark-matter dominated, with dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios of
$M_{\mathrm{dyn}} / M_\star \sim 10-1000$.</p></br></body>
