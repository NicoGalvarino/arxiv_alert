blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in rest-frame UV of its spectral energy
distribution (SED) from a multi-wavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field -
South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength
photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS,
FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous
BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z=2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is
a highly massive system (log $M_{*}$/$M_\odot=12.3$) with substantial
extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds
that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution
cumulated from the early universe. The mass of supermassive black hole (SMBH)
estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H$\rm\alpha$ emission line
yields log $M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$=10.2. We discuss the similarity between the
BlueDOG and 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb
Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV
emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by
the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the
blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation
and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results
from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20074v1" target="_blank"><h2>X-ray view of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at z=3 II. Discovery of

around bright QSOs in Lya emission, little is known about the CGM hot phase due
to its expected faintness in the X-ray band, often referred to as the ICM.
Here, we report the analysis of 634 ks of Chandra X-ray observations in the
MQN01 Cosmic Node, a region containing one of the brightest Lya nebulae and the
largest galaxy overdensity discovered so far at z>3. We detect 66 net counts of
X-ray emission in the 0.5-2 keV band extending to at least 30 kpc from the
brightest QSO in MQN01. The morphology and spectrum are consistent with thermal
emission from hot plasma in CIE. Photoionization is negligible, and IC is
disfavored. A joint spatial and spectral MCMC analysis provides consistency
with a beta-model with a steep density profile and a gas temperature kT~1.8 keV
and virial halo mass Mvir~3e13 Mo. The inferred hot gas mass is
Mhot(<Rvir)~2.6e12 Mo, which is ~8.3% of Mvir, or ~56% of the theoretical
cosmological baryon budget of the halo. The hot gas also emits an exceptionally
high Lx, with a measured L2-10~2.3e45 erg/s within the central 30 kpc. This
system is a clear outlier in the Lx-Tx plane, indicating a thermodynamic state
distinct from that of evolved lower-redshift hot halos. The cooling time in the
inner 15-30 kpc is comparable to the local dynamical time, suggesting that the
gas could become locally unstable in the absence of heating or feedback.
Moreover, the thermal pressure associated with the detected CGM hot phase is
large enough to confine the cold and dense clumps, which are required to
reproduce the high Lya emission associated with the inner regions of the MQN01
structure. Although limited to a single system, our results provide unique
information on the multi-phase properties of the CGM and a view of the nascent
thermal hot gas phase observed in local galaxy clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19494v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: A machine-learning search for dual and lensed AGN at sub-arcsec

of a widespread population of dual accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
on kpc-scale separations, corresponding to projected distances < 0".8 at
redshifts higher than 0.5. However, close companions to known active galactic
nuclei (AGN) or quasars (QSOs) can also be multiple images of the object
itself, strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, as well as foreground stars in
a chance superposition. Thanks to its large sky coverage, sensitivity, and high
spatial resolution, Euclid offers a unique opportunity to obtain a large,
homogeneous sample of dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec projected
separations. Here we present a machine learning approach, in particular a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify close companions to known QSOs
down to separations of $\sim\,$0".15 comparable to the Euclid VIS point spread
function (PSF). We studied the effectiveness of the CNN in identifying dual AGN
and demonstrated that it outperforms traditional techniques. Applying our CNN
to a sample of $\sim\,$6000 QSOs from the Q1 Euclid data release, we find a
fraction of about 0.25% dual AGN candidates with separation $\sim\,$0".4
(corresponding to $\sim$3 kpc at z=1). Estimating the foreground contamination
from stellar objects, we find that most of the pair candidates with separation
higher than 0".5 are likely contaminants, while below this limit, contamination
is expected to be less than 20%. For objects at higher separation (>0".5, i.e.
4 kpc at z=1), we performed PSF subtraction and used colour-colour diagrams to
constrain their nature. We present a first set of dual/lensed AGN candidates
detected in the Q1 Euclid data, providing a starting point for the analysis of
future data releases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19577v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $γ$-Ray Excess: A
  New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nada Salama, Florian List, Geraint Lewis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to PASA</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre
Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass
objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between
the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from
more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an
astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small,
currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother
emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of
gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass
lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the
size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in
the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark
matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we
find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly
greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For
a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude
increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events
remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would
occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a
four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a
definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove
useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19719v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining the Cosmological Constant from Stellar Orbits Around Sgr A*

Networks (PINNs) to constrain the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ through the
analysis of stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* at
the Galactic center. Focusing on the well-observed S2 star, we use an inverse
PINN (iPINN) architecture to infer orbital elements and estimate the total
precession angle from astrometric data. By isolating the contribution from
$\Lambda$, which is defined as the difference between the total precession and
the Schwarzschild precession, we derive a stringent upper bound of $\Lambda
\leq 5.67 \times 10^{-40}, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is approximately two orders
of magnitude tighter than previous estimates obtained using similar data-driven
methods. Extension of our analysis to two additional long-period S-stars, S1
and S9, reveals that while the cosmological precession becomes relatively more
prominent in such systems, limited orbital coverage introduces significant
uncertainties in parameter estimation. Among the cases examined, the constraint
derived from S2 remains the most robust. Our results highlight the potential of
PINN-based approaches for extracting physical insights from sparse or noisy
astronomical data. Future applications to next-generation observational data
and further methodological improvements in machine learning are expected to
refine the cosmological constraints and enable broader tests of gravitational
theories.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20087v1" target="_blank"><h2>Strong Lens Discoveries in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10 with Two

field dwarf galaxies which includes on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT) and is
evolved to $z=0$. Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent
spectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in
the formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of
$10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and only old stellar
populations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed
before and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \sim 3-4$.
The simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the
stellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the
luminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies,
radiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and
reducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core
sizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\sim$ 1 kpc) more
consistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$,
in good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or
SN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z>5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In
contrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines
sharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution,
but their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative
feedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the
reduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the
stellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of
CIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19861v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probe the missing baryons in cosmic filaments with Fast Radio Bursts</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jian-Feng Mo, Weishan Zhu, Qi-Rui Yang, Yi Zheng, Long-Long Feng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 5 figures; Submitted to ApJ; Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), IGM (abstract), intergalactic medium (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic filaments are thought to host a substantial fraction of the missing
baryons at redshifts $z<2$. In this study, we probe the baryonic content of
these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are
identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSe algorithm. We find
tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the
relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the
intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic
filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the
filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with
$\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity
of $\delta = 20.78$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and
observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments
decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$
to $0.15-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03-0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$.
These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z>0.5$, due to the
limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts.
We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of
our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in
cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB
samples and deepening galaxy surveys, which are key steps toward refining these
estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19351v1" target="_blank"><h2>The mass of the Milky Way from outer halo stars measured by DESI DR1</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gustavo E.

of the Milky Way is a parameter of cosmological significance, and its value at
large radii from the Galactic center remains highly uncertain. Following a
hierarchical Bayesian inference approach, we measure the cumulative mass of the
Milky Way using full 6D phase-space information of stars from the first data
release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We employ 330 blue
horizontal-branch stars (BHBs) and 110 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in DESI covering
Galactocentric distances in the range $\sim$50--100 kpc. Within 100 kpc from
the Galactic center, we report an enclosed mass of $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) =
0.57^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) =
0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ when using BHBs and RRLs,
respectively. Extrapolating our mass profiles beyond the extent of our data, we
find the virial mass of the Galaxy to be
$M_{200}=0.85^{+0.16}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and
$M_{200}=0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.15}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We
validate the effectiveness and limitations of our method using mock BHBs and
RRLs from two AuriDESI halos. These tests show that the code recovers the
enclosed mass of the mock galaxy with high precision and accuracy between 50
and 200 kpc, independent of the stellar tracer used and their spatial
distribution. The tests also suggest an underestimation of the galaxy's
cumulative mass at a level of up to $\sim20$\% if stars close to the Galactic
center are used in the models. Our mass estimates lay the groundwork for future
inference of the Galactic mass with upcoming DESI data releases and
spectroscopic surveys mapping the halo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20011v1" target="_blank"><h2>The AstroSat UV Deep Field South-V: Constraints on the average escape of

star-forming galaxies at redshifts $\sim 1-1.5$, using far-ultraviolet (FUV)
imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The
sample spans a wide range of stellar masses and UV luminosities. LyC emission
is undetected in most galaxies (42/49), and stacking these galaxies yields only
an upper limit on the observed LyC-to-nonionizing UV flux density ratio
($({F}_{\lambda,\rm{LyC}}/{F}_{\lambda,\rm{UV}})_{\rm{obs}}<0.12$). Including
all galaxies (with 7 LyC-leaker candidates) produces a marginal $2.4\sigma$
detection, suggesting that the average LyC signal is driven by a small number
of sources. To identify the conditions favorable for LyC escape, we perform
stacking analyses in bins of stellar mass, UV slope, compactness, inclination,
and star formation rate surface density. A stacked LyC signal is detected at a
significance of $\sim3\sigma$ from a subset of galaxies that are characterized
as being compact, have high star formation rate surface densities, and blue UV
continuum slopes, despite each of these being individually undetected in LyC.
This provides the first systematic evidence at $z\sim 1-1.5$ linking these
properties to LyC escape, consistent with trends observed in the lower redshift
universe. Additionally, LyC leakage appears more efficient in low-mass galaxies
($\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot})<9.5$), with their average absolute escape fraction
ranging from $\langle f_{\text{esc,abs}} \rangle\sim0.1-0.2$ depending on
stellar population assumptions. These results support the scenario that
compact, low-mass starbursts were key contributors to the ionizing photon
budget during cosmic reionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19462v1" target="_blank"><h2>Correcting the fiber-aperture bias affecting galaxy stellar populations

Their inference for statistically representative samples requires deep
multi-object spectroscopy, typically obtained with fiber-fed spectrographs that
integrate only a fraction of galaxy light. The most comprehensive local
Universe dataset is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), whose fibers typically
collected ~30% of total flux. Stellar population gradients, ubiquitously
present in galaxies, systematically bias SDSS toward central properties, by
amounts yet to be quantified. We leverage CALIFA integral-field spectroscopy to
simulate fiber-fed observations at redshifts z=0.005-0.4, accounting for seeing
effects. We analyze systematic aperture correction trends across galaxy
morphologies and derive correction recipes based on: fiber-measured indices,
global g-r color, absolute r-band magnitude Mr, and physical half-light radius
R50. Corrections for absorption indices typically reach >~15% of their
dynamical range at z~0.02, decreasing to ~7% at z~0.1 (median SDSS redshift)
and becoming negligible above z~0.2. Spiral galaxies exhibit the largest
aperture effects due to their strong internal gradients. Our correction
recipes, applied to the SDSS-DR7 dataset, significantly reduce scatter in
stellar population diagnostic planes and enhance bimodality in age-sensitive
diagrams. Corrections reveal systematic overestimates of old galaxy fractions
by up to 10% and an underestimate by >~0.2 mag of the transition luminosity at
which old galaxies become dominant. Aperture corrections significantly impact
observational tracers of stellar populations from fiber spectroscopy.
Absorption indices corrections applied to SDSS-DR7 will provide a robust local
benchmark for galaxy evolution studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19339v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Binding Energies of Atoms on Amorphous Silicate Dust: A

We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust
particles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for
the chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding
energies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S,
Ca, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies,
and Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the
binding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local
minima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found
for each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8
eV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe
(6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding
energies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a
log-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have
large binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust
particles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N,
O, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding
energies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated
with dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM),
suggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We
estimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to
3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on
silicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time,
provide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed
chemical reactions in the interstellar medium.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20065v1" target="_blank"><h2>Joint Analysis of HI Absorption Zeeman Measurements and the Morphology

morphology of filamentary HI emission to investigate the three-dimensional
structure of the magnetic field in the diffuse neutral interstellar medium
(ISM). Our analysis is based on the Arecibo Millennium Survey and new data from
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward radio
sources 3C 75, 3C 207, and 3C 409. Toward 3C 409, we make a 4$\sigma$ Zeeman
detection and infer $B_{LOS}$ = 9.1 +/- 1.9$\mu$G, in agreement with Arecibo
results. We quantify the dispersion of HI filaments at the locations and
velocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-HI narrow-channel emission maps.
Focusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak
but statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.3, $p =
0.01$) between $|B_{LOS}|$ and the circular variance of HI filament orientation
angles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by HI
absorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission.
We find evidence that existing HI absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic
fields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas
($100$-$500$ pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and
exhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of $B_{LOS}$. We attribute the
correlation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary HI morphology to
large-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle
across different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local
Bubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19340v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Impact of Radial Migration on Disk Galaxy SFHs: II. The Role of bar

Comments welcome!</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Reconstructing the star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies is central
to understanding their growth and evolution, yet such estimates can be strongly
biased by stellar radial migration - the redistribution of angular momenta over
cosmic time. Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the
TNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred
from present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to
quantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of
migration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces
artificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably,
about 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that
these populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects
appear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and
in 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths
SFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by
dispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these
distortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history:
strong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and
150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average
outer-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk
biases up to 125%. Merger timing further modulates these patterns. Our results
demonstrate that failing to account for stellar migration can lead to severe
misinterpretations of when and where stars formed, with direct implications for
the chemical and evolutionary histories of the MW and external galaxies.</p></br></body>
