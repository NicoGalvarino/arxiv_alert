most luminous objects in the Universe, serving as important probes of cosmic
history and galaxy evolution. The size of the accretion disc surrounding the
black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their
potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of
accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z<0.2$),
limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here,
we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar
QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\sim2$ Gyrs old.
Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla
Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month
monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features
and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the
disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region
at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\sim 500$ AU). Given
a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these
measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and
pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long
spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00774v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the
  Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Saiyang Zhang, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ALMA (abstract), JWST (abstract), atomic hydrogen (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH)
binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using
high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs
($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse
black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH
formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation,
and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion.
Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling,
shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with
significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim
0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square
streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense,
gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These
clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim
10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH
formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at
redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial
mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH
binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining
high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave
sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe
black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00732v1" target="_blank"><h2>The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andrea Sacchi, Guido Risaliti, Matilde Signorini, Emanuele Nardini, Elisabeta Lusso, Bartolomeo Trefoloni</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, submitted to A&A, comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has
been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to
explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work
focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the
properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS)
and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey
(eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV
band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average
spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources
for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$,
respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no
significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with
previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the
relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological
applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current
samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We
show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00585v1" target="_blank"><h2>A sample of giant radio sources from the NVGRC catalog</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Olga Zhelenkova, Milena Khoruzhenko</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 3 figures, to be published in Proceedings of the conference "Modern observational cosmology", 2025, Nizhny Arkhyz</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC
catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey.
We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling
within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In
the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14%
as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\% as
physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one
radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known
GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time.
Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for
z<0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but
already at z>0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The
predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to
observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys.
Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be
classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source
phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes
74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE
photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When
visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close
neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of
galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39%
of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of
galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this
proportion may be higher.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00667v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dependence of halo properties on central-satellite magnitude gaps

information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves
as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this
work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the
magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated
central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample.
Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in
bins of central luminosity, $L_\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude
gap, $L_\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo
properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of
$10^{10.3}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot]\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller
gaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7}
<L_c[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is
detected. In the range of $10^{9.9}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq
10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We
compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs
built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap
dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations,
but neither matches them in all $L_\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We
also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and
concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both
parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration
if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00694v1" target="_blank"><h2>Forward cascade of large-scale primordial magnetic fields during

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought
to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These
magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of
recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the
conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic
collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and
moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied
this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational
collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the
general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as
seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00672v1" target="_blank"><h2>On type 1 active galactic nuclei with double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}]. II.

AGNs. We analyze long-term optical light curves of 35 type 1 AGNs with such
features from our recent catalog in Zheng et al. (2025). These light curves are
obtained from the Catalina Sky Survey and modeled using a Damped Random Walk
(DRW) process. A control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs matched in redshift,
intrinsic luminosity, and black hole mass is also studied. If the double-peaked
\oiii~are caused by two type 1 AGNs (dual type 1 AGN), then the combined
variability from the two AGNs would be expected to differ from that of a single
type 1 AGN. However, there is no statistically significant difference in the
variability timescale $\tau$ and intrinsic variability amplitude $\sigma$
between these double-peaked AGNs and the control sample of 210 normal type 1
AGNs. Crucially, computer simulations reveal that dual AGN systems
systematically produce lower variability amplitudes than single AGNs, which is
inconsistent with the observed variability properties of our double-peaked
\oiii~sample. Moreover, simulations suggest that the fraction of dual type 1
AGNs is $\sim$ 3\%, indicating that double-peaked \oiii~may not be a reliable
indicator of dual type 1 AGNs in these systems. However, this does not rule out
the possibility that some objects may still host dual AGNs involving other
combinations, such as type 1+type 2 AGNs. Future studies with larger samples
and higher-quality light curves will help clarify the true nature of these
systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00059v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Discovery of 25 um Interstellar Methanol</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sarah L.

10^17 cm-2, comparable to sub-mm measurements. Complementary analysis of
acetylene (C2H2) absorption lines is also included. Both CH3OH and C2H2 reveal
an unresolved second velocity component. These MIR absorption lines likely
probe the molecular material in two edge-on disks, supporting the scenario that
NGC 7538 IRS 1 consists of multiple protostars. We provide an updated line list
for the torsional band of CH3OH, which was generated from lab work and model

integrated radio luminosity. If this radio emission is bright enough, inhabited
galaxies themselves form a cosmic population of artificial radio galaxies. We
can detect these broadcasts individually or set constraints from their
collective emission. Using the formalism in Paper I and II, I set bounds on the
artificial radio galaxy population using both of these methodologies. Measured
radio source counts set limits on radio broadcasts across the radio spectrum,
including the first Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) constraints
at ~250 GHz. I compare these with commensal limits from background galaxies in
the fields of large SETI surveys. The field limits are more powerful, but
generally only over a limited luminosity range and for frequencies with
dedicated SETI surveys. The limits are weaker when broadcasts clump into
discrete hosts that are themselves extremely rare. I find that the abundance of
Kardashev Type III radio broadcast populations is less than one in 10^17 stars,
about one in a million large galaxies. I also examine limits for a power-law
distribution in broadcast luminosity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00690v1" target="_blank"><h2>Analogues of the Milky Way-Sagittarius interaction in the TNG50: effect

Laporte</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 10 figures, submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> kinematics (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is undoubtedly being disrupted in the tidal
field of the Milky Way. The Milky Way disc is also found to be in a state of
disequilibrium. The role of the Sagittarius in driving or contributing to this
disequilibrium has been extensively investigated. Most of these studies,
however, assume an initially near-equilibrium disc. It was also hypothesized
that the passage of Sagittarius could have increased the star-forming activity
in the Solar Neighbourhood. We check whether galaxies that have undergone
cosmological evolution are affected by interactions analogous to those between
the Sagittarius and the Milky Way. We use the high-resolution simulation TNG50
to look for pairs similar to the Milky Way and Sagittarius. We search within
redshift z=1-0 for discs from the MW/M31 sample that interacted with a
satellite more massive than 10 billion Msun, had a pericenter smaller than 50
kpc, and was on an approximately polar orbit. We exclude cases where, within 1
Gyr of the pericenter, a similar interaction occurred. In 90 percent of cases,
a passage of the Sagittarius analogue had no significant effect on either the
vertical velocity field of the disc or the star formation history. A response
in vertical stellar kinematics can be found mostly in cold discs and mildly
correlates with the strength of interactions. For star formation, the studied
interactions had an effect only when little to no star formation was ongoing
prior to the interaction, often due to previously disturbed star-forming discs,
e.g., from AGN activity. Our results indicate that stellar discs in TNG50 are
frequently vertically perturbed preceding pericenter passages of Sagittarius
analogues. Future studies using other simulations and extragalactic surveys
will help establish whether vertical disequilibrium is a common feature of disc
galaxies or an artifact of the specific setup studied.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00073v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Simons Observatory: Assessing the Impact of Dust Complexity on the

tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, in the context of the Simons Observatory, using a
cross-spectrum component separation analysis. Employing a suite of simulations
with realistic Galactic dust emission, we find that spatial variation in the
dust frequency spectrum, parametrized by $\beta_d$, can bias the estimate for
$r$ when modeled using a low-order moment expansion to capture this spatial
variation. While this approach performs well across a broad range of dust
complexity, the bias increases with more extreme spatial variation in dust
frequency spectrum, reaching as high as $r\sim0.03$ for simulations with no
primordial tensors and a spatial dispersion of $\sigma(\beta_d)\simeq0.3$ --
the most extreme case considered, yet still consistent with current
observational constraints. This bias is driven by changes in the
$\ell$-dependence of the dust power spectrum as a function of frequency that
can mimic a primordial $B$-mode tensor signal. Although low-order moment
expansions fail to capture the full effect when the spatial variations of
$\beta_d$ become large and highly non-Gaussian, our results show that extended
parametric methods can still recover unbiased estimates of $r$ under a wide
range of dust complexities. We further find that the bias in $r$, at the
highest degrees of dust complexity, is largely insensitive to the spatial
structure of the dust amplitude and is instead dominated by spatial
correlations between $\beta_d$ and dust amplitude, particularly at higher
orders. If $\beta_d$ does spatially vary at the highest levels investigated
here, we would expect to use more flexible foreground models to achieve an
unbiased constraint on $r$ for the noise levels anticipated from the Simons
Observatory.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00049v1" target="_blank"><h2>Segmenting proto-halos with vision transformers</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Toka Alokda, Cristiano Porciani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 38 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables; comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The formation of dark-matter halos from small cosmological perturbations

design and a U-Net transformer. We find that the transformer-based network
significantly outperforms the CNN across all metrics, achieving sub-percent
error in the total segmented mass per halo class. Both networks deliver much
higher accuracy than the perturbation-theory-based model \textsc{pinocchio},
especially at low halo masses and in the detailed reconstruction of proto-halo
boundaries. We also investigate the impact of different input features by
training models on the density field, the tidal shear, and their combination.
Finally, we use Grad-CAM to generate class-activation heatmaps for the CNN,
providing preliminary yet suggestive insights into how the network exploits the

radio galaxy J1712$-$2435 at 1.3 GHz with 7.\asec5 resolution and an RMS
sensitivity of 8 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Due to the angular proximity to the
Galactic Center (l=359.6$^\circ$, b=+8.5$^\circ$) the immediate environment is
not well understood but there are massive clusters nearby. Emission can be
traced over an extent of 34.\amin6 which at the redshift of 0.024330
corresponds to a projected length of 1.02 Mpc. The inner jets are quite
straight but then bend and completely decollimate into extended plumes nearly
orthogonal to the initial jet directions at a projected distance of
approximately 100 kpc. The nearly unity brightness ratio of the inner jets
suggest that they are orientated within a few degrees of the plane of the sky.
The 1400 MHz power is 3.9$\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, somewhat below the
FRI/FRII divide. The total power emitted is estimated to be 5.6$\times 10^{41}$
erg sec$^{-1}$ over the range 10 MHz to 100 GHz. The source dynamics are
modeled with magneto-hydrodynamics simulations; the result is a rough
reproduction of the source's radio morphology / appearance. This study further
highlights the merit of alternative scenarios, calling for future observational
and numerical efforts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23560v1" target="_blank"><h2>Submillimeter Class II methanol masers near the massive protostar S255IR

present study is based on the observations of this object with ALMA in Band 7
at the largest baselines, which provide the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas.
We estimated physical conditions in the region from which comes the maser
emission, and in the surroundings, using the presumably quasi-thermal methanol
lines in our bands and the CH$_3$CN $19_\mathrm{K} - 18_\mathrm{K}$ line
series. The total flux density in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ line in 2021 is
about two times higher than in 2019. A maser emission of about the same

transition at 336.9 GHz. The physical conditions in the masering and
non-masering regions are similar. The masers are apparently excited by the
radiation of the central source. Unfortunately, the existing models cannot
adequately take into account this radiation. The $18_{-3}-17_{-4}$ E transition
at 345.919 GHz shows characteristics of maser emission, too.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00671v1" target="_blank"><h2>Chemical abundances of seven stars in the GD-1 stream</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jing-Kun Zhao, Guang-Wei Li, Wako Aoki, Gang Zhao, Guo-Chao Yang, Jian-Rong Shi, Hai-Ning Li, Tadafumi Matsuno, Miho Ishigaki, Takuma Suda, Satoshi Honda, Yu-Qin Chen, Qian-Fan Xing, Hong-Liang Yan, Yong Yang, Xian-Hao Ye</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 4 figures.

Ba-Eu correlation (r = 0.83, p=0.04) exists, with [Ba/Fe] = -0.03 $\pm$ 0.05,
indicating a common r-process origin. This extreme chemical homogeneity
strongly supports an origin from a single disrupted globular cluster. The lack
of light-element anti-correlations may stem from our sample size or the

(LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying
them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the
first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been
identified at $z>10$, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers
wavelengths up to $\sim5\,{\rm \mu m}$ and is insufficient to capture the
characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this
study, we present the first search for $z\gtrsim10$ LRD candidates using both
NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint
NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date ($0.20\,{\rm deg^2}$). Taking advantage of
MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10
at $z_{\rm phot}=10.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ with $M_{\rm UV}=-19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\,{\rm
mag}$. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a
non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at $z\sim10$. Based on
this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at
$z\sim10$ with $M_{\rm UV}\sim-20$ of $1.2^{+2.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-6}\,{\rm
Mpc^{-3}\,mag^{-1}}$, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall
galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching $\sim3\%$ at $z\sim10$.
Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature
of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at
$z>10$, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23355v1" target="_blank"><h2>SPT-3G D1: Axion Early Dark Energy with CMB experiments and DESI</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB
experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also
highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find
statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only
moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we
find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is
$f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.12$ at $95\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension
between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\,\sigma$ level. When
combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\rm
EDE}\,<\,0.091$ at $95\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\, \sigma$
level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild
preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble
tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at
$68\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\,\sigma$. From the
combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,
0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over
$\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to
$2.3\, \sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI
dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI
and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\Lambda$CDM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00094v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic Trajectories calculation with state of the art lattice QCD

phase diagram as the plasma cools from $T\simeq500\,$MeV to $30\,$MeV, assuming
$\beta$-equilibrated matter. The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously
solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation,
closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order
Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest
$(2\!+\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus
delivering a consistent $(2\!+\!1\!+\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are
compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to
highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are
analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\ell_e=\ell_\mu=\ell_\tau=\ell/3)$ and an
asymmetric one $(\ell_e=0,\;\ell_\mu=-\ell_\tau)$. Increasing $|\ell|$
systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\mu_B$ and more
negative $\mu_Q$. In the asymmetric case, a non-monotonic bounce develops when
the $\tau$ chemical potential reaches $m_\tau$, generating a maximum in
$\mu_B(T)$, the position of which depends on $\ell_\tau$. Assuming a modest
$\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained
at $\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored
($|\ell|\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard
cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth
crossover. Nevertheless, we estimate the magnitude of baryon and lepton
asymmetries needed to obtain a cosmic trajectory closer to the QCD critical
point, providing inputs for future studies of the strong-interaction epoch.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00090v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring IceCube Neutrino Alerts with the HAWC Observatory</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ian Herzog</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> While much work has gone into associating neutrino emission with various

As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with
the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia
supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher
level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes
at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3

baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of
dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density
around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the
supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak
does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the
measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard
and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy
density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to
0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative
quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in
front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the
aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over
$\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of
exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our
analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic
fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant
role in cosmic dynamics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00315v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the gravitational waves from super massive RHNs produced at

implications for the thermal history of the universe and may leave observable
imprints in the gravitational wave (GW) background. In scenarios where the
inflaton couples predominantly to heavy fields, say right-handed neutrino
(RHN), non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance can lead to
their efficient production, even when their masses exceed the inflaton mass.
Once produced, the RHNs emit gravitons through bremsstrahlung as they decay
into the Standard Model (SM) particles via $N\rightarrow \ell + H$, enabled by
the unavoidable minimal coupling to gravity, sourcing a stochastic GW
background. We study this mechanism within the framework of $\alpha-$attractor
inflationary models, highlighting how the resulting GW spectrum carries
indirect imprints of the heavy sector and the post-inflationary dynamics. This
offers an observational window into otherwise inaccessible supermassive
particles and provides a powerful probe of high-scale physics beyond the SM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23354v1" target="_blank"><h2>Consistent $N_{\rm eff}$ fitting in big bang nucleosynthesis analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sougata Ganguly, Tae Hyun Jung, Seokhoon Yun</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 2 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, serves as a key
fitting parameter extensively employed in cosmological studies. In this work,
we point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of
$N_{\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its
applicability to new physics scenarios where $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, the
deviation of $N_{\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To
ensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the
allowed range of $N_{\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced
reaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete
example, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$
arises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay
of long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the
neutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton
conversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN
constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the
conventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into
the $\Delta N_{\rm eff} < 0$ regime.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00798v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion

phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation
notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which
nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the
model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the
gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that
captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion
gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector,
i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive
parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of
strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the
reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions
that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper
limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark
radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies
of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF
benchmark.</p></br></body>
