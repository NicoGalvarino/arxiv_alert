large-scale outflows that redistribute energy, momentum, and baryons between
the interstellar medium and the halo, making them a key feedback channel
regulating galaxy evolution. Despite their importance, the driving physics
behind galactic outflows and their interaction with the surrounding halo is yet
to be fully understood. In particular, the influence of a pre-existing
reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxy halos has not been clearly
established. We determine the conditions required to launch outflows in the
presence of halo CRs and investigate how CR pressure gradients modify outflow
speeds. We find that CR halos suppress the development of large-scale,
CR-driven winds and redirect CR feedback toward local recycling flows. Slow
outflows are therefore more likely in young galaxies lacking extended CR halos,
while fast winds in intense starbursts are dominated by momentum injection and
largely unaffected by halo CRs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16608v1" target="_blank"><h2>Reverberation lags viewed in hard X-rays from an accreting stellar-mass

a hot cloud of plasma that glows brightly in X-rays, known as the corona. The
X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid
variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring
time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal
X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation
lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron
emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\sim 30$
keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few
supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much
more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes
because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag
measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus
been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of
the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by
measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying
detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation
and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray
binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are
prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower
variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate
perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal
that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of
days.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17696v1" target="_blank"><h2>Tracing the high-z cosmic web with Quaia: catalogues of voids and

fundamental goal of cosmology, using various tracers of the cosmic large-scale
structure at an ever wider range of redshifts. Our principal aim is to advance
the mapping of the cosmic web at high redshifts using observational and
synthetic catalogues of quasars (QSOs), which offer a powerful probe of
structure formation and the validity of the concordance cosmological model. In
this analysis, we selected 708,483 QSOs at $0.8<z<2.2$ from the Quaia data set,
allowing a reconstruction of the matter density field using 24,372 deg$^2$ sky
area with a well-understood selection function, and thus going beyond previous
studies. Using the REVOLVER method, we created catalogues of voids and clusters
based on the estimation of the local density at QSO positions with Voronoi
tessellation. We tested the consistency of Quaia data and 50 mock catalogues,
including various parameters of the voids and clusters in data subsets, and
also measurements of the density profiles of these cosmic super-structures at
$100 h^{-1}$Mpc scales. We identified 12,842 voids and 41,111 clusters in the
distribution of Quaia QSOs. The agreement between data and mocks is at a level
of 5-10%, considering void and cluster radii, average inner density, and
density profiles. In particular, we tested the role of survey mask proximity
effects in the void and cluster detection, which albeit present, are consistent
in simulations and observations. The largest voids and clusters reach $R_{eff}
\approx 250 h^{-1}$Mpc and $150 h^{-1}$Mpc, respectively, but without evidence
for ultra-large cosmic structures exceeding the dimensions of the largest
structures in the mocks. As an important deliverable, we share our density
field estimation, void catalogues, and cluster catalogues with the public,
allowing various additional cross-correlation probes at high-z.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18077v1" target="_blank"><h2>Star-forming galaxies in the cosmic web in the last 11 Gyr</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  B.

Comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> atomic gas (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their
position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from
redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to
filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether
these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy
population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies,
robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas
depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the
cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton
using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament.
After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate
(SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions
as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent
modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z
\gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion,
reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend
in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances
($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores,
suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are
not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at
low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity
modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas
supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms
dominating across cosmic time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18055v1" target="_blank"><h2>JADES: the chemical enrichment pattern of distant galaxies - silicon

the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564
sources at $z=4$--7 have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.46$
and a median star-formation rate of
$\log(\mathrm{SFR}/M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}})=0.30$, placing them close to
the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our
564 sources has relatively low [C/O]$=-0.70$, moderate [Ne/O]$=-0.09$, and low
[Ar/O]$=-0.28$ values at a low gas-phase metallicity of
$12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.71$ ($Z\sim 0.1~Z_\odot$), suggesting dominant yields
of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak
SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen
abundance ratio of [Si/O]$=-0.63$, which is lower than that of stars in the
Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting
silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than
that we newly derive for two individual $z>6$ galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248)
with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of
$M_{*}$, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope
$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin
and the blue-$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$ bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O
ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the
all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with
rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-$z$ star-forming
galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O

mass of supermassive black hole in the center of active galaxy nuclei (AGNs).
However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for
blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the
contributions of the accretion disk and relativistic jet in blazars by
analyzing the optical spectroscopic data. Applying this method to two
flat-spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017, we find that the
H$\gamma$ variability in PKS 1510-089 lags behind the disk by approximately 116
days, while the H$\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 52 days relative to the
disk in PKS 0736+017. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate that the
black hole masses are about $1.8 \times 10^8\ M_\odot$ for PKS 1510-089 and
about $7.0 \times 10^7\ M_\odot$ for PKS 0736+017, respectively. This method
paves the way to apply the RM method for blazars, and improves the
understanding of disk and jet activities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17211v1" target="_blank"><h2>The changing look of the neutrino-emitter blazar candidate 5BZQ

traditional BL Lacs-flat spectrum radio quasars empirical classification of
blazars based on the intensity of optical spectral lines, as they appear to
transition between the two classes over time. Aims. We focus on the blazar 5BZQ
J1243+4043, recently proposed as a promising candidate for the emission of
high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and reported
as a changing look in the literature. We study the spectral properties of this
blazar, inferring its radiation field and accretion regime properties among
different epochs. Methods. This study presents new optical spectroscopy
observations of 5BZQ J1243+4043 taken with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We use
this new dataset and two optical spectra available from the literature to
investigate the continuum and line emissions and pinpoint the physical
properties of the source. Results. The newly collected data for 5BZQ J1243+4043
shows broad emission lines, consistent with the spectrum of the first epoch and
the redshift $z = 1.5181\pm0.0002$ known from the literature. For the second
epoch, the spectrum appears featureless, and we place limits on the emission
lines and related physical properties. We observe spectral variability for both
the continuum and line emissions among the three spectra. Despite this, the
accretion properties of the blazar remain, overall, unvaried, indicating that
the intrinsic physics remains the same across the three epochs. In the broader
multi-messenger context, this suggests that, despite the changing look in the
optical band, the candidate neutrino-emitter blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043 remains
characterized by the presence of intense external radiation fields and
radiatively efficient accretion, typical of high-excitation radio galaxies,
that may foster neutrino production.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17720v1" target="_blank"><h2>BASS LIV. Physical Properties of AGN-Hosting Galaxy Mergers from

supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. As merging nuclei approach each other,
the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH
growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and
characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We
constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard
X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems,
including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations
$\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features.
We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to
account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to
perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties.
Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from
the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates
(SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by
the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios
$<$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a
good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification
accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological
analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\times$), AGN
luminosities (2.4$\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\times$) compared to
earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between
merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16796v1" target="_blank"><h2>Binary black holes in magnetized AGN disks</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Raj Kishor Joshi, Aryan Bhake, Biswajit Banerjee, Bhargav Vaidya, Milton Ruiz, Antonios Tsokaros, Andrea Mignone, Marica Branchesi, Amit Shukla, Miljenko Čemeljić</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers occurring within the disks of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational waves
detectable by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) interferometers. Some of these
events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic
flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising
sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for
electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion
flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although
recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk
models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong
magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems.
In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local
shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a
magnetized disk of an AGN.
  We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the
formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical
extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and
strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive
black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the
central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of
stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system
via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk
properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the
amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial
role in governing the outflow strength.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17536v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the influence of radio-faint AGN activity on the

Re-submitted to A&A after (minor) revision</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> It is well-known that star-forming galaxies (SFGs) exhibit a tight
correlation between their radio and infrared emissions, commonly referred to as
the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). Recent empirical studies have reported a
dependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive
galaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less
massive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual
contamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not
captured through "radio-excess" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we
aim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio
luminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program
"AGN-sCAN" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the
IRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on
low-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations
reach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio
brightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K. This classification serves as a robust
AGN diagnostic, regardless of the host galaxy's star formation rate. We detect
four VLBA sources in the deepest regions, which are also the faintest
VLBI-detected AGN in SFGs to date. The effective AGN detection rate is 9%, when
considering a control sample matched in mass and sensitivity, which is in good
agreement with the extrapolation of previous radio AGN number counts. Despite
the non-negligible AGN flux contamination (~ 30%) in our individual VLBA
detections, we find that the peak of the qIR distribution is completely
unaffected by this correction. We conclude that residual AGN contamination from
non-radio-excess AGN is unlikely to be the primary driver of the M* - dependent
IRRC.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17954v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmic inventory of the background fields of relativistic particles in

astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse
components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our
understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with
stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled
by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the
extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using
observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth
orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate
data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that
contribute to the extragalactic background.
  In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most
comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background
spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27
frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most
extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We
explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of
relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star
formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating
these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions
of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the
extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV
to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in
the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the
origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and
ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17831v1" target="_blank"><h2>The origin of the intra-cluster light in The Three Hundred simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A.

(ICL) in The Three Hundred simulations, a set of 324 hydrodynamically
resimulated massive galaxy clusters. The ICL, a diffuse component of stars not
bound to individual galaxies, serves as a key tracer of cluster formation and
evolution. Using two hydrodynamics implementations, Gadget-X and Gizmo-Simba,
we identify the stellar particles comprising the ICL at z=0 and trace them back
in time to the moments when they were formed and accreted into the ICL. Across
our 324 clusters, half of the present-day ICL mass is typically in place
between $z \sim $ 0.2 and 0.5. The main ICL formation channel is the stripping
of stars from subhalos after their infall into the host cluster. Within this
channel, 65-80 per cent of the ICL comes from objects with stellar (infall)
masses above $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, i.e., massive galaxies, groups and clusters.
Considering the ratio of the infalling halo to the total cluster mass, a median
of 35 per cent of the mass is brought in major merger events, though this
percentage varies significantly across clusters (15-55 per cent). Additional
contributions come from minor mergers (25-35 per cent) and smooth accretion
(20-50 per cent). The primary contributors typically infall at $z \leq 1$, with
smaller fractions arriving at redshifts between 1 and 2. Regarding other
formation channels, we find minor contributions from stars formed in subhalos
after their infall and stars stripped while their contributing halo remains
outside the host cluster (and can eventually fall inside or stay outside).
Finally, for our two sets of simulations, we find medians of 12 (Gadget-X) and
2 (Gizmo-Simba) per cent of the ICL mass formed in-situ, that is, directly as
part of the diffuse component. However, this component can be attributed to
stripping of gas in high-velocity infalling satellite galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18078v1" target="_blank"><h2>DESI Strong Lens Foundry IV: Spectroscopic Confirmation of DESI Lens

the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations
from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both
ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\sim$8 kpc
from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in
both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density,
using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic
winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\sim2$ kpc,
then rises again, remaining high ($\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\sim$5 kpc.
We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate
(above $z~>2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for
uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass
outflow rate (traced by H$\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ and
$5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA
observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which
correlates to $\lesssim2.9~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire
outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge
generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations.
The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a
galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the
slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling
around the galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18086v1" target="_blank"><h2>DESI Strong Lens Foundry III: Keck Spectroscopy for Strong Lenses

under debate. This study analyzes new NICER observations of QPEs in Ansky (a
transient event in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J1335+0728), taken between
January and June 2025. By examining flare durations, peak-to-peak recurrence
times, and profiles, we compare the 2025 data with those from 2024 to

found to be four times more energetic, with recurrence times of approximately
10 days and flare durations ranging from 2.5 to 4 days, making them both about
twice as long as in 2024. Additionally, the flare profiles have become more
asymmetric, showing longer decays. We explore different theoretical scenarios
to explain the observed properties of the QPEs in Ansky, including evolving
stream-disk interactions in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system as a
potential mechanism behind the observed changes in recurrence time and
energetics, while also considering alternative models based on mass transfer
and accretion disk instabilities. Continued observational efforts will be
crucial for unveiling the nature of Ansky.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17697v1" target="_blank"><h2>Environmental history of filament galaxies: stellar mass assembly and

Xie</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A, comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxy properties correlate with their position within the cosmic web. While
galaxies are observed in an environment today, they may have experienced
different environments in the past. The environmental history, linked to
pre-processing, leaves an imprint on the properties of galaxies. We use the
GAEA semi-analytic model and IllustrisTNG to reconstruct the environmental
histories of galaxies between $z=0$ and $z=4$ that today reside in filaments.
Our goal is to understand how galaxy properties are related to their past
environments, and the role of the cosmic web in shaping their properties. We
find that filament galaxies at $z=0$ are a heterogeneous mix of populations
with distinct environmental histories. The vast majority of them have
experienced group processing, with only $\sim$20\% remaining centrals
throughout their life. For $\rm 9 < \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) < 10$ galaxies,
models confirm that the environmental effects are primarily driven by group
processing: satellites stop growing stellar mass and exhibit elevated quenched
fractions, whereas filament galaxies remain centrals have properties that are
similar to field galaxies. Massive galaxies ($\rm \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) >
10$) that have never been satellites and entered filaments more than 9 Gyr ago
show accelerated stellar mass assembly and higher quenched fractions relative
to the field, due to a higher frequency of merger events inside filaments, even
at fixed mass. The most massive $\rm \log ((M_{star} / M_{sun}) > 11$) galaxies
accreted onto filaments over 9 Gyr ago, highlighting the role of filaments in
building up the high-mass end of the galaxy population. Filaments regulate
galaxy evolution in a mass-dependent way: group environments regulate low-mass
galaxies, while filaments favour the growth of massive galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16964v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mid-Infrared diagnostics for identifying main sequence galaxies in the

star formation, and dust properties. Characterizing this spectrum therefore
offers strong constraints on a galaxy's activity. This project describes a
diagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs)
in the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic
of galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has
been generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we
developed a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning
methods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission
features, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust
continuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\mu}m, 7.7
{\mu}m, 8.6 {\mu}m, and 11.3 {\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the
radiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was
subsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in
real-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an
accuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows
low contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF.
Combining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables
the creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral
properties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting
key dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the
need to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star
formation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is
insufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a
physically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR
wavelengths.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17071v1" target="_blank"><h2>Lensed quasars in CatNorth I.

quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of
dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ
systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the
sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and
applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed
from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90%
purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has
three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72
arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends
search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing
the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable
WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of
likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We
identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using
available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate
systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled
as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual
quasars as a by-product. When feasible, we plan follow-up spectroscopy and
deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related
science.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17369v1" target="_blank"><h2>Volume Density Mapper: 3D Density Reconstruction Algorithm for Molecular

distributions of molecular clouds from 2D observations. This method decomposes
the column density into multi-scale components, reconstructing a 3D density
field that preserves key physical properties such as mean density, maximum
density, and standard deviation along the line of sight. Validated against
numerical simulations (FLASH and ENZO), the algorithm achieves high accuracy,
with mean density estimates within 0.1 dex and dispersions of 0.2 to 0.3 dex
across varied cloud structures. The reconstructed 3D density fields enable the
derivation of critical parameters, including volume density, cloud thickness,

prescriptions, is widely used to interpret cosmic infrared background (CIB)
anisotropies and connect star-forming galaxies to large-scale structure. Recent
implementations adopt more physical parameterizations, but it remains unclear
whether these models reliably recover astrophysical quantities. We test whether
current CIB halo models can constrain the star formation efficiency,
$\eta(M_h,z)$, and the halo mass where it peaks, $M_{\rm max}$, when fitted to
mock data. We examine whether discrepancies arise from emission assumptions
(the HOD ingredients) or from more fundamental components, such as bias and
matter clustering. Using the M21 CIB HOD model within the halo framework, we
fit mock CIB power spectra and star formation rate density (SFRD) data from the
SIDES-Uchuu simulation, then repeat the analysis with a simplified simulation
(SSU) matched to the HOD assumptions. Comparing best-fit parameters to known
inputs, we find that although the M21 model fits the mock data well, it fails
to recover intrinsic parameters, especially $M_{\rm max}$, even when applied to
data generated with consistent assumptions. Emission-related quantities (SFRD,
emissivity) agree within 5%, but the two-halo term shows a redshift- and
scale-dependent offset exceeding 20%, likely due to the linear treatment of
halo bias and matter clustering. Scatter in the SFR-halo mass relation and
spectral energy distributions significantly impacts shot noise ($\sim 50\%$)
but only modestly ($<10\%$) the clustered signal. We conclude that robust
recovery of physical parameters from CIB clustering requires improved
cosmological ingredients in halo models, including scale-dependent halo bias
and nonlinear matter power spectra, alongside refined emission modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17751v1" target="_blank"><h2>Monte Carlo parameter study for Seyfert AGN-starburst composite galaxies

non-thermal high-energy radiation. In this regard the IceCube observation of
high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Seyfert-starburst composite
galaxy NGC 1068 is not surprising. More recently, another Seyfert-starburst
composite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even
higher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called
AGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of
being partially $\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated
version of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a
proper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and
the secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes.
Moreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the
parameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under
consideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can
successfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN
corona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high-
energies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be
explained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external
$\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong
influence of the $\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need
for an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial
extent of the $\gamma$-ray production site.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16307v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Three Isolated Faint Dwarf Galaxies

unique opportunities to study galaxy evolution at the smallest scales, free
from environmental effects of more massive galaxies. Our HST data reach
$\sim$2-4 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch for each dwarf,
allowing us to measure their distances, structural properties, and recent star

(GC), with unmatched chemical complexity. We combine photometric and
spectroscopic catalogs to identify its distinct stellar populations and to
investigate their spatial distribution and chemical properties, uncovering new
insights into the cluster's formation history. We identify the iron-poor stars
commonly found in GCs: the first population (1P), with halo-like chemical
composition, and the second population (2P), enriched in elements produced by
p-capture processes. Similarly, we divided the iron-rich stars (the anomalous
stars) into two groups: the AI and the AII, exhibiting light-element abundance
distributions similar to 1P and 2P stars, respectively. The wide extension of
our dataset (five times the half-light radius) allowed us to directly and
unambiguously compare the fraction of these populations at different radii. We
find that 2P and AII stars are more centrally concentrated than the 1P and AI.
The remarkable similarities between the 1P-2P and AI-AII radial distributions
strongly suggest that these two groups of stars originated from similar
mechanisms. Our chemical analysis indicates that the 1P and AI stars (the lower
stream) developed their inhomogeneities through core-collapse supernova (and
possibly other massive stars') self-enrichment, and that these populations
contributed p-capture-processed material to the intracluster medium, from which
the chemically extreme 2P and AII stars (the upper stream) formed. Additional
polluters, such as intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia
supernovae, likely played a role in shaping the AII. Finally, we propose that
2P and AII stars with intermediate light-element abundances (the middle stream)
formed via dilution between the pure ejecta that created the upper stream and
lower-stream material.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17454v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Hubble Tension resolved by the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations

Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$
model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend
as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant
tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM
model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17848v1" target="_blank"><h2>WALLABY Pilot Survey: the extensive interaction of NGC 4532 and DDO 137

Survey (WALLABY), high-resolution neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of
the dwarf galaxy pair NGC 4532/DDO 137 (WALLABY J123424+062511) have revealed a
huge (48 kpc) bridge of gas between the two galaxies, as well as numerous arms
and clouds which connect with the even longer (0.5 Mpc) tail of gas previously
discovered with the Arecibo telescope. Our modelling suggests that a
combination of ram pressure and tidal forces are responsible for the nature of
the system. Although the pair lies well outside of the virial radius of the
Virgo cluster, ram pressure due to infall through an extensive envelope of hot
gas around the cluster is most likely responsible for the HI tail. Over a
timescale of 1 Gyr, the predicted electron density ($1.2\times 10^{-5}$
cm$^{-3}$) and infall velocity (880 km s$^{-1}$) are probably sufficient to
explain the extensive stripping from the common gaseous envelope of NGC
4532/DDO 137. The ongoing tidal interaction with the Virgo cluster appears to
have prevented a rapid merger of the binary pair, with the mutual tidal
interaction between the galaxy pair being responsible for raising gas from the
outer parts of the galaxy potential wells into the HI bridge and common
envelope. The NGC 4532/DDO 137 system mirrors many of the physical features of
the Magellanic System, and may lead to a better understanding of that system,
as well as casting more light on the relative importance of interaction
mechanisms in the outskirts of dynamically young galaxy clusters such as Virgo.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15792v1" target="_blank"><h2>Absence of Radio Emission Reveals an Exceptionally Weak Explosion of the

hosting a unique optical source driven by an ultrafast outflow with a velocity
of 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. The nebula was proposed to be the remnant of a white
dwarf merger that occurred in 1181CE. We report no detection of the radio
diffuse emission from Pa 30 or radio emission from the central source, setting
$3\sigma$ upper limit flux densities of $0.84\,\rm mJy$ and $0.29\,\rm mJy$ at
1.5 GHz and 6 GHz, respectively, for Pa 30. The radio surface brightness of Pa
30 is $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude smaller than that of typical supernova
remnants (SNRs) with comparable angular size. If Pa 30 is an SNR, our
observations show it to be the faintest known in the radio band. Considering
that 10\% of the supernova (SN) kinetic energy is transferred to cosmic rays
(CRs), the absence of radio synchrotron emission suggests that the SN kinetic
energy $\lesssim3\times 10^{47}(B/10 \mu\rm G)^{-1.65}$ erg, which is 3 to 4
orders of magnitude lower than that of typical SNRs and the lowest measured
among Galactic SNRs. There is also an indication of inefficient CR acceleration
for this source. The low SN kinetic energy either implies the potential
existence of many more radio-faint, sub-energetic SNRs in our Galaxy or
challenges the SNR interpretation of Pa 30.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15672v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spatially non-parametric recovery of intrinsic kinematic maps in pre- to

"Spatially Non-parametric Approach to PSF Deconvolution using ROHSA".
ROHSA-SNAPD utilises kinematic regularisation to forward model the intrinsic
emission-line flux and kinematics (velocity and linewidth) of 3D data cubes.
Kinematic regularisation removes the need to assume an underlying rotation
model (eg. exponential disc, tilted-ring) to deconvolve kinematic data. We
evaluate the code on mock observations of simulated galaxies: one idealised
disc model and three more complex galaxies from a cosmological simulation with
varying levels of kinematic disturbance, from pre-merger to post-merger state.
The mock observations are designed to approximate published results at $z\sim
1-2$ from 8-metre class near-infrared spectroscopic facilities, using realistic
observational parameters including spatial and spectral resolution, noise and
point spread function. We demonstrate that ROHSA-SNAPD can effectively recover
the intrinsic kinematics of complex systems whilst accounting for observational
effects. ROHSA-SNAPD is publicly released on Github.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17003v1" target="_blank"><h2>On Atomic Line Opacities for Modeling Astrophysical Radiative Transfer</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jonathan Morag</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 3 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In astrophysics, line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in
theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is
dominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of
sharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate
frequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated
shock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a
mult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the
similar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important
differences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different
choices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a
frequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the
often-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short
letter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free
(photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the
importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the
equation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating
photon mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can
underestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders
of magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution
currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new
features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent
opacity table.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16996v1" target="_blank"><h2>Radiation Mediated Shock and Planar Shock Breakout in the Presence of
  Atomic Transition Lines</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jonathan Morag</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 10 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We numerically study fast Newtonian radiation mediated shocks (RMS - v/c~0.2)
in two simplified problems in the context of supernova shock breakout; (1) An
RMS traveling in a uniform medium, and (2) an RMS escaping a powerlaw density
profile in planar geometry (\rho~x^n). Both problems were previously solved in
the literature assuming a fully ionized plasma medium emitting Bremstrahllung.
It was shown that at high shock velocities photons can deviate from local
thermal equilibrium (LTE) and reach distributions peaked at many keV.
  In this study we incorporate, for the first time, opacity from bound species
of heavy elements (solar-like composition) into these two problems, at times
drastically augmenting the photon production due to bound-free and bound-bound
radiative processes. We use a previously developed hydrodynamically coupled
multi-group radiative diffusion code, including inelastic Compton scattering
and frequency-dependent opacity from the publicly available TOPS table. Adding
a more realistic opacity leads the radiation to maintain LTE at higher
velocities in comparison to the fully ionized problem.
  In the planar SBO problem this opacity can reduce the emission temperature by
half and even an order of magnitude. This result is important for the
observation of supernova shock breakout emission. The SED of SN envelope
breakout will very likely remain in LTE for explosions in red super giant stars
without stellar wind (and part of blue super giant star explosions), making
X-Ray observations less likely in these cases by orders of magnitude relative
to previous predictions. We provide a semi-analytic description for the SED in
the case where LTE is maintained. A correct shock-breakout calculation requires
opacity tables that include bound yet highly ionized species, ruling out the
use of certain line tables (such as the commonly used Kurucz table).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16202v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sound-Horizon-Agnostic Inference of the Hubble Constant and Neutrino

$H_0$, by combining DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data with the
latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from Planck, ACT,
and SPT-3G, the angular size of the CMB acoustic scale, Dark Energy Survey
Year-3 ($3\times2$-pt) galaxy weak lensing and clustering correlations, and the
Pantheon+ supernova sample. In this analysis, the sound horizon at the drag
epoch, $r_d$, is treated as a free parameter, avoiding assumptions about
early-Universe physics. By combining uncalibrated comoving distances from BAO
and supernovae with constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ from CMB
and galaxy lensing/clustering, we break the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy and obtain
$H_0 = 70.0 \pm 1.7$ km/s/Mpc when the sum of the neutrino masses is fixed at
$\Sigma m_\nu = 0.06$ eV. With a conservative prior on the amplitude of
primordial fluctuations, $A_s$, we find $H_0 = 70.03 \pm 0.97$ km/s/Mpc and
$r_d = 144.8 \pm 1.6$ Mpc. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$ to vary yields $H_0 =
75.3^{+3.3}_{-4.0}$ km/s/Mpc and $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.55^{+0.23}_{-0.37}$ ($<1.11$
eV) at 68% (95%) CL, and $H_0 = 73.9 \pm 2.2$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu =
0.46^{+0.21}_{-0.25}$ ($=0.46^{+0.40}_{-0.45}$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL when a prior
on $A_s$ is applied. Forecasts for the completed DESI BAO program, combined
with Simons-Observatory-like CMB lensing, next-generation $3\times2$-pt data,
and expanded supernova samples predict $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 0.67$ km/s/Mpc with
fixed $\Sigma m_\nu$, and $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 1.1$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu
< 0.133$ ($<0.263$) eV at 68% (95%) CL when the neutrino mass is varied. As the
precision of BAO, CMB lensing, and galaxy lensing/clustering improve, this
$r_d$-agnostic framework will provide an independent test of the need for new
physics at recombination.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17525v1" target="_blank"><h2>The 6 year radio lightcurve of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Matthew Burn, Adelle J.

disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this
work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption
event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically
motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the
decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into
the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling
we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear
medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to
$r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption
events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years
post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit
to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a
single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From
forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that
the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its
current rate of evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16978v1" target="_blank"><h2>Formation of unsaturated carbon chains through carbon chemisorption on

environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report
high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and
\'ECLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including
$10$ bursts with high fluence ($>25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track
burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM),
from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's
local environment: $0.32\pm0.19$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts
in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or
variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens
along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely
located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these
(time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a
dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more
dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less
extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact,
persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution
shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous
studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of
hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we
estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's

EAS measurements above the knee, for instance, have helped to understand some

located in the galaxy cluster WHL J105147.4+552309. This wide-angle tail (WAT)
galaxy exhibits a complex radio morphology, characterised by a right-angled
bend in the northern jet, which resembles an axe, and multiple kinks in the
southern jet, as observed in the deep uGMRT radio observations. The radio power
of J1051+5523 at 150 MHz is estimated to be $2.91 \times
10^{25}\,\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$, placing it in the transition zone between FRI
and FRII radio galaxies. The spectral index map reveals a flat core and
relatively flat lobes, which may indicate ongoing particle acceleration or a
relatively young population of relativistic electrons in the lobes. Further, we
estimate the equipartition magnetic fields, and spectral ages of the northern
and southern lobes to be approximately 150 Myr and 153 Myr, respectively,
suggesting a long-lived radio source with sustained AGN activity. A relative
velocity of 278 $\pm$ 2643 $\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is obtained for the host
galaxy. Due to the large uncertainty associated with the relative velocity
estimates, the contribution of ram pressure to the jet bending remains
inconclusive. The low mass of the host cluster ($\sim 2 \times
10^{14}\,M_\odot$) and the lack of diffuse X-ray emission indicate a reduced
likelihood of major mergers, but minor mergers or interactions remain possible.
We propose that the observed WAT morphology of J1051+5523 is likely shaped by a
