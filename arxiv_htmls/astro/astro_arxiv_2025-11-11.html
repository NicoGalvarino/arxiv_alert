surrounding medium and are thought to potentially prevent gas cooling and
maintain the quiescence of massive galaxies. The short-lived, sporadic, and
anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant
cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the
efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative
method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio
feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those
in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical
images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent
RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given
stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten
times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time,
that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity.
In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of
condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE
galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN
has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent
gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary
to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive
galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy
formation models need serious revision.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06085v1" target="_blank"><h2>A JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit Survey of Luminous Quasars at z ~ 5-6

form and evolve within the first billion years. We report results from a James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) survey of 27
luminous quasars at $z \sim 5$-$6$, enabling a systematic investigation of
their key physical properties and the associated, extended line emission. Our
sample hosts SMBHs with $\log(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\odot) \sim 8.6$-$9.7$ and
Eddington ratios of $\sim 0.1$-$2.6$ based on H$\beta$, and the H$\beta$-based
and H$\alpha$-based BH mass are broadly consistent with each other. Our sample
may have a slightly smaller median BH mass and larger median Eddington ratio
than lower-redshift quasars within the same luminosity range, although the
difference could still be explained by statistical uncertainties. They
generally follow the empirical correlations between [O III] $\lambda$5007
equivalent width and bolometric luminosities or Eddington ratios formed by
lower-redshift quasars. The majority of them fall within the Eigenvector~1
planes formed by lower-redshift quasars. Nevertheless, a subset of the sample
shows enhanced, blueshifted [O III] emission associated with fast outflows.
Spatially extended [O III] line emission is detected in 6 objects and shows
morphologies and kinematics consistent with merging activities and/or turbulent
and clumpy interstellar media (ISM). Tentative evidence of quasar radiative
feedback shaping the ISM of a merging companion galaxy is seen in the object
with the most extended [O III] emission. Our results provide crucial insight
into the rapid growth of SMBHs and the gaseous environments they reside in at
z$\sim$5-6.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05644v1" target="_blank"><h2>Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE). XIV. The Observability of

enables direct mapping of its spatial and kinematic structure, offering new
insight into the gas flows that regulate galaxy evolution. Using the
high-resolution Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) simulations, we
generate mock emission-line maps for six Milky Way-mass halos. Different ions
(e.g., HI, OVI) trace distinct CGM phases and structures, highlighting the
importance of observations in multiple species. We quantify the observable CGM
mass fraction as a function of instrument spatial resolution and surface
brightness sensitivity, finding that sensitivity is the dominant factor
limiting detectability across all ions. At fixed sensitivity, higher spatial
resolution reveals more structures; at fixed spatial resolution, higher
sensitivity recovers a higher percentage of the total mass. We explore CGM
kinematics by constructing emissivity-weighted projected velocity maps and
comparing line-of-sight velocities between ions. OVI shows the largest
kinematic deviation from HI, while MgII and SiII most closely follow HI
velocities. Distinguishing these phases out to 50kpc from the galaxy center
requires spectral resolution better than 30km/s for most ion pairs.
Additionally, separating inflowing from outflowing gas based on projected
kinematics also requires high spectral resolution: at 30km/s, more than 80% of
gas above the emission detection threshold can be distinguished kinematically,
but this fraction drops to <40% with a resolution of 200km/s. Our results
provide predictions for future UV and optical instruments, showing that
recovering the multiphase structure and kinematics of circumgalactic emission
will require both high sensitivity and fine kinematic resolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05669v1" target="_blank"><h2>Continuum Reverberation Mapping of 18 AGN Over Four Years</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Jake A.

both the observed flux and continuum interband delays. We monitored 18 AGN over
four years of observations to acquire high quality optical continuum light
curves, measuring time lags between different photometric bands and determining
continuum emission sizes for each AGN. We add this sample to existing lag
measurements to test the correlation between continuum lags at $5100\r{A}$
($\tau_{5100}$) and $5100\r{A}$ luminosity ($L_{5100}$). We observe that
$\tau_{5100} \propto L_{5100}^{0.4}$, broadly consistent with the theoretical

luminosity functions (XLFs) of 4506 X-ray sources projected within a radius of
2.5 deg centering on M31. We construct XLFs for different regions in the disk
and halo of M31, accounting for the incompleteness with an effective
sensitivity map. Assuming that the halo regions contain (mostly) foreground
stars and background active galactic nuclei, they are taken as "background" for
deriving the XLFs of the sources in the disk. Through modeling XLFs, we
decompose the X-ray sources into distinct populations for each region. We find
that low-mass X-ray binaries are the dominant X-ray population throughout the
disk of M31. The XLFs of M31 reveal a consistently lower integrated LMXB
luminosity per stellar mass ($\alpha_\mathrm{LMXB}$) compared to other
galaxies, likely due to M31's prolonged period of quiescent star formation.
Variations in the XLF shape and $\alpha_\mathrm{LMXB}$ across different regions
of M31 suggest that the relationship between integrated luminosity and stellar
mass may vary within the galaxy. Additionally, the relatively low integrated
luminosity observed in the inner-arm region provides crucial evidence for a
rapid fading of M31's LMXBs around 1 Gyr, a finding consistent with recent
observations of other nearby galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05647v1" target="_blank"><h2>Not all protoclusters host evolved galaxies: Evidence for reduced

galaxies and large-scale structure co-evolve in the early Universe. We present
JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the photometrically identified $z=7.66$
protocluster core in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 lensing field, SMACS-PC-z7p7. Six
[O III]-emitters and five additional photometric candidates are found within a
0.3 arcmin$^2$ ($1.5\ {\rm cMpc}^2$) region, corresponding to an overdensity of
$\delta \sim 200$. Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies
exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column
densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar
redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral
hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of
galaxies within a $z=7.88$ protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison
with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of ${\rm
log_{10}}(M_{200{\rm c}}[{\rm M_{\odot}}]) = 11.4\pm0.2$, and implies that, on
average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster
(${\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\rm c},\ z=0}[{\rm M_{\odot}}]) = 13.7\pm0.6$). The
uniformly young, highly star-forming nature of the galaxy population of
SMACS-PC-z7p7 suggests that environmental effects only become significant above
halo masses of ${\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\rm c}}[{\rm M_{\odot}}]) \gtrsim 11.5$.
Comparison to other $z\gtrsim7$ protoclusters reveals that vigorous star
formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution
and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes. SMACS-PC-z7p7
therefore represents an early stage of protocluster assembly, where residence
within an overdense environment still enhances star formation, and feedback
processes have yet to exert a significant influence.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05930v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGN-Driven Biconical Outflows as the Origin of the Double-Peaked [O~{\sc

J134733.36+121724.27 (4C+12.50), confirming the presence of the double-peaked
[O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$\AA\ doublet and a broad H$\alpha$. The
former likely results from AGN-driven biconical outflows, while the absence of
a broad H$\beta$ supports a classification of the source as a Type-1.9 AGN. We
analyze its high-quality Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical spectrum after
robustly subtracting host galaxy and AGN continuum contributions through a
simple stellar population fitting method employing 39 templates and a power-law
continuum. Each narrow line of the [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$\AA\
doublet is better described by two Gaussian components (blue-shifted and
red-shifted) than by a single Gaussian, as confirmed by the F-test. Broad
components are included for both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, but only H$\alpha$
reveals a significant detection, further supported by a comparison between the
SDSS spectrum and that previously reported. These results support that the
object is highly consistent with a Type-1.9 AGN classification, and the
double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}] profiles are most likely produced by AGN-driven
biconical outflows rather than by a rotating narrow-line region or a dual AGN
merger system. Additional observations are still needed to strengthen these
conclusions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05851v1" target="_blank"><h2>Supermassive Black Hole and Broad-line Region in NGC 5548: 2023

campaign for active galactic nuclei (AGN) of NGC 5548, continuing our long-term
monitoring program. Using the Lijiang 2.4-meter telescope, we obtained 74
spectra with a median cadence of 1.9 days. Through detailed spectral
decomposition, we measured the light curves of the optical continuum at
5100~\AA\ and the broad He~{\sc ii}, He~{\sc i}, H$\gamma$, and H$\beta$
emission lines. The time lags of these lines relative to the continuum are
measured as $1.3^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$, $2.3^{+1.5}_{-2.1}$, $10.0^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$, and
$15.6^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$ days (rest-frame), respectively. Velocity-resolved lag
profiles for H$\gamma$ and H$\beta$ were constructed. Combined with data from
previous seasons (2015$-$2021), we find that the radial ionization
stratification of the broad-line region (BLR) is stable; the average virial
mass of the supermassive black hole in NGC~5548 is $(2.6\pm1.1)\times
10^{8}M_{\odot}$, consistent with the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation; the broad
He~{\sc ii} line exhibits the largest responsivity, followed by broad He~{\sc
i} (or H$\gamma$) and H$\beta$ lines; the BLR kinematics show significant
temporal evolution, transitioning from virialized motions to signatures of
inflow and outflow. Furthermore, an analysis of 35 years of historical data
confirms a 3.5-year time lag between variations in the optical luminosity and
the BLR radius, potentially implicating the role of radiation pressure or
dynamical structure changes in the inner accretion disk. Long-term campaign
demonstrates that the BLR in NGC 5548 is a robust yet dynamically evolving
entity, providing crucial insights into AGN structure and accretion physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06038v1" target="_blank"><h2>A New Phase of Optical Activity of BL Lacertae in the Fall of 2024:

active galactic nuclei, blazars, but also one of the most active and rapidly
changing objects in this class. In the fall of 2024 (September--November), BL
Lacertae underwent another episode of strong optical activity, reaching an
R-band magnitude of about 12 and showing extremely rapid and large-amplitude
inter- and intra-night flux and polarization variations. During this period,
the object was monitored over 40 nights using telescopes with an aperture of up
to 2 m at three observatories: Rozhen and Belogradchik in Bulgaria and Skinakas
in Greece. The results from this study include some of the most spectacular
intra-night variability episodes detected in a blazar. These rapid variations,
combined with high photometric accuracy and high time resolution, allowed for
confirmation of consistency between different optical bands with zero time
delays, down to a minute scale. Unlike previous activity reports, polarization
was relatively stable on these short time-scales. Possible connections between
polarization, flux, and intra-night variability were explored in order to
better model or constrain the physical processes and emission mechanisms in the
relativistic jets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06537v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resolved Schmidt-Kennicutt relation in a binary hyperluminous infrared

J084933.4+021443, a z = 2.41 binary HyLIRG (galaxies W and T) with two
additional luminous companions (C and M), offers an ideal laboratory for
studying star formation during "cosmic noon". We use ALMA to obtain resolved
imaging and kinematics of CO J:7-6, [C I] 2-1, H2O, and rest-frame 340-1160 GHz
continuum emission in all four galaxies. Each system is spatially resolved
within ~0.3 arcsec (2.5 kpc) apertures. Gas kinematics in W and T are
rotation-dominated, with galaxy T showing emission extended along its kinematic
minor axis due to lensing magnification. Spatially resolved SEDs indicate that
W is well fitted by single-temperature greybody dust despite hosting a luminous
AGN, while T requires an additional hot-dust component and extra millimetre
emission. We confirm [C I] J:2-1 as a tracer of warm/dense molecular gas in
these extreme systems, though its luminosity ratio with CO J:7-6 rises
sub-linearly. We derive resolved (2.5 kpc-scale) Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK)
relations for W and T using both cold and warm/dense gas, finding depletion
times of about 50-100 Myr (W) and about 100-500 Myr (T). Both galaxies follow a

AGNs at $z<0.05$ with high-cadence ($<3$ days) and multiband photometric
observations. Time series analysis of these light curves shows two main
results: (1) The interband lags are broadly consistent with $\tau \propto
\lambda^{4/3}$, while the average interband lags are larger than those
predicted by the standard thin accretion disk model. (2) For most targets,
there exists a $U$ band lag excess, which is probably due to the diffuse
continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR). We employ the ICCF-Cut
method to extract the possible diffuse continuum component from the $U$ band
light curves and calculate the diffuse continuum lags ($\tau_{\rm cut}$), which
are generally consistent with the lags ($\tau_{\rm jav}$) derived by the
JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model. Further analysis with our
sample indicates a positive correlation between the diffuse continuum region
size and the BLR size ($R_{\rm DCR}-R_{\rm BLR}$ relation), as well as another
correlation with the luminosity ($R_{\rm DCR}-L$ relation). These findings
provide further evidence for a significant contribution of diffuse continuum

star-formation rate, and molecular gas reservoir on global and resolved scales.
On the path to quiescence, the exchange between gas and stars must inevitably
be broken. Understanding the mechanisms governing star formation and quenching
therefore requires observations of both the stellar and molecular gas
components. To this end, we have assembled a sample of 277 galaxies ($0.02
\lesssim z \lesssim 0.25$) with semi-resolved optical and millimetre
$^{12}$CO(1-0) data, wherein the properties of the inner $\thicksim$2 kpc can
be distinguished from the outer regions. This effort was made possible by the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogues and the maturing archive of the
Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA). We call this dataset the SDSS-ALMA
Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE). In this work, we leverage
SALVAGE to provide a semi-resolved perspective on global scaling relations and
why some galaxies deviate from them. In agreement with previous work, we find
that the offset of a galaxy from the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS)
is driven by its inner star formation rate. With the relative inner and outer
distributions of molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency, we
investigate whether the central star formation driving global changes is due to
fuel availability or efficiency. We find that the position of a galaxy within
the SFMS is largely due to the inner star-formation efficiency, while departure
from the SFMS is driven by availability of central gas. The central few kpc are
thus the most consequential region for galaxy evolution at low redshift.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06707v1" target="_blank"><h2>Seyfert Galaxies as Neutrino Sources: An Outflow$-$Cloud Interaction

source, Seyfert galaxies have emerged as the most prominent class of
high-energy neutrino emitters. In this work, we perform a detailed
investigation of the outflow--cloud interaction scenario for neutrino
production in Seyfert nuclei. In this framework, fast AGN-driven winds collide
with clumpy gas clouds in the nuclear region, forming bow shocks that
efficiently accelerate cosmic-ray protons. The accelerated protons subsequently
interact with cold protons from the outflows via inelastic proton--proton
($pp$) collisions, producing high-energy neutrinos, while the photomeson
($p\gamma$) process with disk photons may provide a subdominant contribution at
the highest energies. Applying this model to five neutrino-associated Seyfert
galaxies, we successfully reproduce the observed TeV neutrino fluxes without
violating existing gamma-ray constraints. By integrating over the Seyfert
population using X-ray luminosity functions, we further demonstrate that
Seyfert galaxies can account for a substantial fraction of the diffuse
astrophysical neutrino background in the $10^4-10^5~{\rm GeV}$ energy range.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05695v1" target="_blank"><h2>EDGE-INFERNO: How chemical enrichment assumptions impact the individual

massive stars, the timing and yields of SNeIa, and the intrinsic stochasticity
that arises from sampling individual stars and galaxy formation chaoticity. All
simulations are high-resolution (3.6 pc), cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical
simulations that track the stellar evolution of all individual stars with
masses $>0.5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We find that variations in SNIa assumptions
make the largest difference in mean abundance ratios and [Fe/H], highlighting
the importance of detailed SNIa modeling even in such low-mass
reionization-limited galaxies. In contrast, different massive star yields,
accounting (or not) for stellar rotation, result in mean abundances comparable
to those arising from stochasticity. Nonetheless, they significantly affect the
shape of abundance trends with [Fe/H], for example, through the existence (or
not) of a bimodality in the [X/Fe] - [Fe/H] planes, particularly in [Al/Fe].
Finally, we find that the variance arising from random sampling severely limits
the interpretation of single galaxies. Our analysis showcases the power of
star-by-star cosmological models to unpick how both systematic uncertainties
(e.g., assumptions in low-metallicity chemical enrichment) and statistical
uncertainties (e.g., averaging over enough galaxies and stars within a galaxy)
affect the interpretation of chemical observables in ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07221v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar Populations in Satellite Galaxies in Close Pairs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anne E.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> SDSS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Satellite galaxies that are near to massive primary galaxies in close pairs
can have stellar population ages that are more similar to their primaries than
expected. This is one way in which close pairs of galaxies show galactic
conformity, which is thought to be driven by assembly bias. Such conformity is
seen in ages, morphologies and star formation rates in different samples. This
paper revisits a high signal-to-noise SDSS spectroscopic sample, by spectral
fitting of new stellar population models, to investigate satellite galaxy
properties of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance. We find the clear
signature of age conformity, as previously seen, but no clear evidence for
conformity in metallicity or abundance ratios. The offsets showing age
conformity are not caused by age-metallicity degeneracies. There is a
suggestion in these data that lower velocity dispersion satellites have
increased [alpha/Fe] compared to a control sample of passive galaxies, however
this needs further observations to be verified. Our results also suggest an
intriguing turnover in the age trends of the satellites at the highest velocity
dispersion, perhaps reflecting the onset of environment-related processes in
the most massive groups.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05925v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dissecting the Perseus-Pisces supercluster observed with CFHT-MegaCam:

formation and evolution. Filaments of the cosmic web provide key environments
that channel the growth of structures. Guided by predictions from cosmological
simulations, we study the morphological distribution of galaxies in the
Perseus-Pisces Supercluster, a prominent filamentary complex at 70 Mpc. We
focus on how galaxy morphology and structural disturbances relate to position
within the filament network and to proximity to dense nodes. Our sample is
built from a spectroscopic catalogue cross-matched with deep r-band
CFHT/MegaCam imaging from UNIONS and additional time, enabling the detection of
low-surface-brightness features and extended outer structures. Morphologies are
determined both visually and through structural parameters extracted from
surface-brightness profiles using AutoProf and AstroPhot. The 3D filamentary
skeleton of Perseus-Pisces is reconstructed with the DisPerSE algorithm,
providing distances from each galaxy to the nearest filament and to group or
cluster centres. The 3D mapping reveals a network of interconnected
sub-filaments converging around the Pisces cluster, forming a complex,
multi-branched structure that likely shapes environmental effects on galaxy
evolution. We observe clear morphological and stellar-mass segregation: massive
early-type galaxies (E/S0) concentrate along filament spines and near dense
nodes, while late-type and irregular systems are more broadly dispersed. About
10-13% of galaxies show strong signs of gravitational interaction, with
stellar-halo asymmetries particularly common in filaments and groups. These
findings underline the dual influence of filamentary environments, which both
host evolved early-type systems and foster local tidal interactions and
pre-processing that modify galaxy morphology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06596v1" target="_blank"><h2>PHANGS-JWST: the largest extragalactic molecular cloud catalog traced by

aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission structures that trace molecular gas,
including CO-dark regions. We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7
$\mu$m PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution,
extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were
inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for
clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these
and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond
to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA,
or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection
limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart.
Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH
clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little
across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in
spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to $2\times10^{3}
M_{\odot}$ shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with
enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface
densities decline by a factor of $\sim 1.5-2$ toward $2 - 3 R_{e}$. However,
the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and
even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale
processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two
catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the
native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds,
molecular clouds, and star formation studies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06481v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Calibration of Short Wavelength Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon

Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission (3.3 and 7.7 $\mu$m) across a sample of four nearby
galaxies (NGC 5194, 5236, 628, and 4449). These maps are utilized to calibrate
the PAH features as star formation rate (SFR) indicators in 40 pc size regions
around massive emerging young star clusters (eYSCs). We find a tight,
sub-linear (power-law exponent, $\alpha{\,}{\sim}{\,}0.8$) relation between the
PAH luminosities (3.3 and 7.7 $\mu$m) and SFR (extinction corrected Pa$\alpha$)
in near solar metallicity environments. PAH destruction in more intense
ionizing environments and/or variations in the age of our sources may drive the
deviation from a linear relation. In the metal-poor environment of NGC 4449
(${\sim}$1/3 Z$_{\odot}$), we see substantial deficits in the PAH feature
strengths at fixed SFR and significantly higher scatter in the PAH-SFR
relations. We determine that the 3.3/7.7 $\mu$m PAH luminosity ratio increases
towards lower metallicity environments. This is interpreted as a result of a
shift in the size distribution towards smaller PAHs at lower metallicities,
possibly due to inhibited grain growth. Focusing on the regions in NGC 4449, we
observe a decreasing 3.3/7.7 $\mu$m ratio towards higher SFR, which could
indicate that small PAHs are preferentially destroyed relative to larger PAHs
in significantly sub-solar metallicity conditions. We estimate that ${\sim}$2/3
of the PAH emission in typical local star-forming galaxies is excited by older
stars and unrelated to recent ($<$10 Myr) star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06317v1" target="_blank"><h2>MeerKAT observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 2997 in the S band.

telescope with the new S-band receivers (2.0-2.8 GHz). To showcase its enhanced
capabilities, we conducted new S-band observations of the galaxy NGC 2997 in
full polarization. The S band is ideal for studying magnetic fields in spiral
galaxies due to the weak Faraday depolarization. Performing a rotation measure
(RM) synthesis allowed us to measure Faraday RMs in the galaxy, a signature of
regular magnetic fields. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to
study the various azimuthal modes found in the RM data of the galaxy. The RM
synthesis analysis indicates the direction of the magnetic field along the line
of sight throughout the entire disk. Leveraging the sensitivity and high
resolution provided by MeerKAT's S-band capability, this study achieves an
unprecedented level of detail of the magnetic field structure. Our sector-based
analysis of the RMs across azimuthal regions reveals the existence of modes of
the large-scale magnetic field in NGC 2997. The variations in the RM values
along the azimuthal angle reveal smoothly changing phase shifts between the
rings, without the previously reported field reversal at about 3 kpc radius
between the central region and disk. In this work, for the first time, a
Fourier analysis has been applied to RM data averaged in sectors of rings in
the disk plane of a spiral galaxy. Our Fourier analysis of the RM map shows
three different large-scale field modes detected in the disk of NGC 2997. After
applying a geometric modification, even multiples of the first mode were

The telescope offered an ideal vantage view of the Southern Sky and benefited
from optimal water properties for enhanced angular resolution. This study makes
use of data collected over the entire operational period of ANTARES to search
for sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, considering both steady and
flaring emission scenarios. First, a time-integrated search for high-energy
neutrino clustering across the celestial sphere is conducted. The most
significant accumulation is found at coordinates $(\alpha, \delta)
=(200.5^\circ\, 17.7^\circ)$ with a post-trial p-value equal to 0.38. A
dedicated search in the Galactic Plane is also performed for extended sources,
yielding no significant excess. Additionally, a list of potential neutrino
sources are investigated. The blazar MG3 J225517+2409 is identified as the most
significant object, yet the excess remains compatible with background
fluctuations. A mild local excess of 2.4$\sigma$ is found for the blazar TXS
0506+056. The full sky is also examined for the presence of flaring neutrino
emissions. The most significant excess in this case corresponds to a
$\sim$4-day flare from the direction $(\alpha, \delta) = (141.3^\circ\,
9.8^\circ)$, with a post-trial p-value of 0.30. Finally, the directions of
sources highlighted in IceCube's time-dependent searches are investigated.
Temporal overlaps between ANTARES and IceCube flares are identified for PKS

investigated the inner envelope structures of three extremely young protostars,
selected for having the shortest dynamical timescales in their outflows and
jets. Our analysis is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) observations of the N2D+, DCO+, DCN, C18O, CH3OH, and H2CO lines, along
with 1.3 mm continuum data, obtained at two spatial resolutions of ~500 AU and
150 AU. By examining molecular depletion and sublimation patterns, emission
extents at core-scale and outflow rotational temperatures, we assessed the
relative evolutionary stages of the three sources. In G208.68-19.20N1, the
absence of N2D+ toward the core-despite a semi-ring-like distribution-and the
presence of bright DCN and DCO+ emission cospatial with C18O indicate a warmer
envelope, possibly suggesting a more advanced evolutionary state. In contrast,
G208.68-19.20N3 shows no dense central structures in C18O, DCN, DCO+, or N2D+,
with emission instead appearing scattered around the continuum and along
large-scale filaments, consistent with a likely younger stage than
G208.68-19.20N1. The third source, G215.87-17.62M, exhibits compact C18O
emission at the continuum peak, but spatially extended N2D+, DCN, and DCO+
along the continuum, pointing to a cooler envelope and likely the youngest
stage among the three. This comparative analysis across three protostars
demonstrates the effectiveness of molecular tracers for evolutionary staging,
though variations in luminosity or accretion may also shape chemical
morphologies. These results highlight the promise of broader surveys for
advancing our understanding of early protostellar evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06116v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing a cosmogenic origin of astrophysical neutrinos and cosmic rays

Neutrino Observatory (IceCube-170922A) was associated, at the $3\sigma$ level,
with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Cosmic rays that are
accelerated in astrophysical sources can escape from their jets and interact
with background radiation fields. Interactions with the extragalactic

constant evolution with new substructures identified continuously. To properly
validate and characterise the family of galactic progenitors, it is important
to take into account all the effects that can shape the distribution of tracers
in the Galaxy. First among the often overlooked actors of galactic dynamics is
the rotating bar of the Milky Way that can affect orbital tracers in multiple
ways. We want to fully characterise the effect of the rotating bar of the Milky
Way on the distribution of galactic tracers, provide diagnostics helpful in
identifying its effect and explore the implications for the search and
identification of substructures. We use the in-house Orbital Integration Tool
(OrbIT), built to include the full effect of the bar and exploit its
multidimensional output to perform a complete dynamical characterisation of a
large sample of carefully selected Milky Way stars with very precise
astrometry. We identify conspicuous overdensities in several orbital parameter
spaces and verify that they are caused by the bar-induced resonances. We also
show how contamination by trapped tracers provides local density enhancements
that mimic the clumping usually attributed to genuine substructures. We provide
a new and expedite way of identifying resonant loci and, consequently, to
estimate the contribution of stars trapped into orbital resonances to
phase-space overdensities previously identified as candidate relics of past
merging events. Among those analysed here, we found that the detections of
Cluster 3 and Shakti seem to have gained a non-negligible boost from
resonance-trapped stars. Nyx is the most extreme case, with 70% of assigned
member stars lying on resonant orbit, strongly suggesting that it is not the
genuine relic of a merger event but an overdensity caused by bar-induced
resonances</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06927v1" target="_blank"><h2>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Integral Field

Accepted by published by Universe</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Determining whether black hole jets are dominated by leptonic or baryonic
matter remains an open question in high-energy astrophysics. We propose that
extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) black holes, where an intermediate mass
secondary black hole (a "miniquasar") periodically interacts with the accretion
flow of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), offer a natural laboratory to probe
jet composition. In an EMRB, the miniquasar jet is launched episodically after
each disk-crossing event, triggered by the onset of super-Eddington accretion.
The resulting emissions exhibit temporal evolution as the jet interacts with
the SMBH accretion disk. Depending on whether the jet is leptonic or hadronic
in composition, the radiative signatures differ substantially. Notably, a
baryonic jet produces a more pronounced gamma-ray output than a purely leptonic
jet. By modeling the evolution of the multifrequency characteristic features,
it is suggested that the gamma-ray-to-UV emissions may serve as a diagnostic
tool capable of distinguishing between leptonic and baryonic scenarios. The
resulting electromagnetic signals, when combined with multi-messenger
observations, offer a powerful means to constrain the physical nature of
relativistic jets from black holes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05686v1" target="_blank"><h2>Towards the Composition of sub-PeV Cosmic Rays at IceCube</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Julian Saffer</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Presented at the XVIII International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP 2023)</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract), AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> With the implementation of a low-energy trigger, the surface array of the
