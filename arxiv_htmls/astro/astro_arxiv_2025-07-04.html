  Population III.1 stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mahsa Sanati, Julien Devriendt, SergioMartin-Alvarez, Adrianne Slyz, Jonathan C.

increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive
galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their
role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid
growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains
poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological
simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds with
their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from
no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups
including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across
all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of
$\sim10^7 M_\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth
histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The
simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with
super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding
2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression
in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate
luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black
holes, dynamical masses of $\sim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, and high, though
short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a
scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the
reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic
medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02476v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the width and profiles of cosmic filaments</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Qi-Rui Yang, Weishan Zhu, GuangYao Yu, Jian-Feng Mo, Yi Zheng, Long-Long Feng</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigated the widths and profiles of cosmic filaments using the
IllustrisTNG simulations. Filaments were identified with DisPerSE, using galaxy
samples in simulations as input. Since the width of an individual filament can
vary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with
lengths between $1.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and
measure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments
increases gradually from approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z =
2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment
width correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent
with previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the
segment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential
estimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments
with different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified
formula akin to the isothermal $\beta$-model. For segments with a given width,
the rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z =
0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the
center to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas
than thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal
profiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300
simulations, and align well with results from earlier studies. We briefly
discuss the potential implications and applications of our findings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02515v1" target="_blank"><h2>Angular correlation functions of bright Lyman-break galaxies at

$\lesssim z \lesssim$ 5 within the COSMOS field by measuring the angular
two-point correlation function. Our robust sample of $\sim$60,000 bright
($m_{\rm UV}\lesssim 27$) Lyman-break galaxies was selected based on spectral
energy distribution fitting across 14 photometric bands spanning optical and
near-infrared wavelengths. We constrained both the 1- and 2-halo terms at
separations up to 300 arcsec, finding an excess in the correlation function at
scales corresponding to $<20$ kpc, consistent with enhancement due to clumps in
the same galaxy or interactions on this scale. We then performed Bayesian model
fits on the correlation functions to infer the Halo Occupation Distribution
parameters, star formation duty cycle, and galaxy bias in three redshift bins.
We examined several cases where different combinations of parameters were
varied, showing that our data can constrain the slope of the satellite
occupation function, which previous studies have fixed. For an
$M_{\rm{UV}}$-limited sub-sample, we found galaxy bias values of
$b_g=3.18^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ at $z\simeq3$, $b_g=3.58^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ at
$z\simeq4$, $b_g=4.27^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ at $z\simeq5$. The duty cycle values are
$0.62^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$, $0.40^{+0.34}_{-0.22}$, and $0.39^{+0.31}_{-0.20}$,
respectively. These results suggest that, as the redshift increases, there is a
slight decrease in the host halo masses and a shorter timescale for star
formation in bright galaxies, at a fixed rest-frame UV luminosity threshold.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02054v1" target="_blank"><h2>RIOJA. JWST and ALMA unveil the inhomogeneous and complex ISM structure

star-forming galaxy COS-2987 at $z = 6.81$, revealed by the unprecedented
synergy between JWST/NIRSpec IFS and ALMA observations. These observations
detect key emission lines, including [OII]$\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 3730, [OIII]
4364, [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$ 4960, 5008, [OIII] 88 $\mu$m, as well as
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. JWST spectroscopy alone indicates interstellar medium
(ISM) properties that are typical for galaxies at $z\sim7$. These include low
dust extinction ($A_{\rm V} \approx 0.14$ mag), moderate electron density
($n_{\rm e} \approx 500$ cm$^{-3}$), and low gas-phase metallicity
($\sim10\%$). However, the strong far-infrared [OIII] 88 $\mu$m emission
detected by ALMA cannot be explained by a single-phase ionized medium with
uniform electron density and temperature. Instead, a two-phase ISM model,
comprising compact, high-temperature, high-density gas components ($T_e \approx
26,000$ K; $n_e \approx 600 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) and an extended, cooler,
lower-density component ($T_e \approx 8,000$ K; $n_e \approx 50
\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), successfully reproduces the observed line ratios of [OIII]
88 $\mu$m/[OIII] 5008 \r{A} and [OIII] 4364 \r{A}/[OIII] 5008 \r{A}, with a
volume ratio of 1 : 300 between the two phases. Our results demonstrate that
JWST alone probes only a fraction of the ISM and highlight the critical
importance of combining JWST and ALMA to reveal the density-stratified ISM of
early galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02053v1" target="_blank"><h2>RIOJA. Merger-induced Clumps in a Galaxy at Redshift 6.81 Revealed by

formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at $z = 6.81$ is one
of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec
Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks
to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from
the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The [OIII] 5008\AA\ line emission
and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure
where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent.
The system is not a simple rotating disk, but instead consists of
merger-induced star-forming clumps, as expected from recent cosmological
simulations. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust
attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially
enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main
clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase ($A_{\rm V} =
0.2$--$0.3$ and SFR(H$\alpha$) $\sim 10$\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$) with almost
zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are
dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies.
These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in
the surrounding gas through the merger event.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02284v1" target="_blank"><h2>The dark matter content of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Draco,

so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco,
Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and
metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans
Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their
inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional
single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model
are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph
into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more
centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity
dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the
inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints
by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The
inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and
$0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also
present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our
results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through
stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the
methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous

Raimundo</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in
$\sim11\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models,
misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic
plane on timescales of $\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of
the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of
active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to
explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central
black hole (BH) activity between $0<z<1$. We use a sample of $\sim5600$
galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$
that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable
misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that
galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH
growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little
difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this
enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned
gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At
$z\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that
have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic
misalignments over the preceding $\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of
aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity
is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of
overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01962v1" target="_blank"><h2>Sub-keV dark matter can strongly ionize molecular clouds</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pedro De la Torre Luque, Pierluca Carenza, Thong T.

strong constraints on dark matter models producing UV/X-ray photons in their

dark matter models, such as axion-like particles, scalars and sterile
neutrinos, for masses between $\sim30$~eV and $10$~keV, and project forecasts
to illustrate the potential of this target. We discuss how these constraints
can be significantly improved by considering a more refined sample of molecular
clouds near the Galactic Center and above the Galactic plane, a detailed
modeling of the cosmic-ray ionization contribution and, potentially, a more
refined analysis of the gas density in clouds through dust extinction maps.
Thus, ionization of molecular clouds emerges as one of the most powerful tools
for probing sub-keV dark matter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02835v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revealing a transitional epoch of large-scale cosmic anisotropy in the

largest scales. While widely supported, this foundational assumption remains
testable. We analyse the angular distribution of over one million quasars from
the Gaia-unWISE catalogue using Renyi entropy, a multiscale statistical measure
sensitive to higher-order clustering. Dividing the sample into three redshift
bins, we find that both the low- and high-redshift distributions are
statistically consistent with isotropy. However, at intermediate redshift ($1
\leq z < 2.2$), we detect a statistically significant and scale-dependent
anisotropy that persists under stringent masking, suggesting a physical origin.
We interpret this as evidence for a transitional epoch in cosmic history,
during which large-scale structures such as superclusters became prominent
before their growth was gradually damped by the onset of accelerated expansion.
These findings position Renyi entropy as a powerful probe of cosmic evolution
and highlight the potential thermodynamic links between structure formation,
entropy dissipation, and the emergence of large-scale isotropy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02041v1" target="_blank"><h2>Turbulence in Simulated Local Cluster Analogs: one-to-one comparisons

motions of the intra cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Current
simulation studies focus mainly on statistical comparisons, making the
comparison to the currently still small number of clusters difficult due to
unknown selection effects. This study aims to bridge this gap, using simulated
counterparts of Coma, Virgo, and Perseus from the SLOW constrained simulations.
These clusters show excellent agreement in their properties and dynamical state
with observations, thus providing an ideal testbed to understand the processes
shaping the properties of the ICM. We find that the simulations match the order
of the amount of turbulence for the three considered clusters, Coma being the
most active, followed by Perseus, while Virgo is very relaxed. Typical
turbulent velocities are a few $\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, very close to observed
values. The resulting turbulent pressure support is $\approx1\%$ for Virgo and
$\approx 3-4\%$ for Perseus and Coma within the central $1-2\%$ of $R_{200}$.
Compared to previous simulations and observations, measured velocities and
turbulent pressure support are consistently lower, in line with XRISM findings,
thus indicating the importance of selection effects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01355v1" target="_blank"><h2>The birth of young radio jets in changing-look AGN: a population study</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Sufia Birmingham, Charlotte Ward, Kristina Nyland, Dougal Dobie, Matthew J.

show significant changes to the flux of broad Balmer emission lines. Recent
studies of CLAGN, such as 1ES 1927+654 and Mrk 590, have revealed that changes
in the optically observed accretion rate are accompanied by changes in radio
activity. We present a time-domain population study of 474 spectroscopically
confirmed CLAGN at radio wavelengths using the Australia SKA Pathfinder
Variable and Slow Transients Survey and the Very Large Array Sky Survey. We
compare the radio properties of this CLAGN sample to a control sample of AGN
that have not had recent changing-look events, and to AGN that were found to
have transitioned from radio-quiet to radio-loud over 10-year timescales in
VLASS. For 20 newly studied CLAGN detected in ASKAP VAST, we do not detect Mrk
590 or 1ES 1927+654-like fading of the radio flux in the 10 years following
changing-look events. For 6 CLAGN with a sufficiently low redshift and high
enough mass, we rule out a Mrk 590-like flare. We find that at the population
level, CLAGN have higher VAST/VLASS detection rates, lower fractions of radio
loudness, and higher variability rates in the 1 GHz frequency compared to the
control AGN. Through VLA observations of radio SEDs and Magellan spectroscopic
observations, we do not find evidence of a link between CLAGN and AGN that
transitioned from radio-loud to radio-quiet in VLASS. We discuss the

of a low-luminosity AGN. The two off-centre sources are consistent with a star

explore a scenario where super-Eddington accretion onto the black hole drives a
dense wind that falls back onto the disk, triggering star formation in a
circumnuclear ring.</p></br></body>
