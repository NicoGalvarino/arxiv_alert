distribution (SED) that ionizes the gas-rich broad emission line region is key
to understanding the various radiative processes at play and their importance
that eventually leads to the emission line formation. We modeled a spectral
energy distribution for highly accreting quasars, also known as extreme
population A sources, based mainly on observational data available in
astronomical databases, and on accretion disk models for the unobservable
far-UV domain. Our selection criterion is the RFeII parameter - the ratio of
the optical FeII emission between 4434 A and 4684 A to the H-beta 4861 A
intensity, RFeII > 1. This criterion is satisfied by highly-accreting, possibly
super-Eddington, black holes. We analyzed 155 sources up to a redshift of
approximately 1, previously reported in the literature, to construct a median
radio-quiet SED spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We find that the SED
of quasars exhibits distinct features compared to lower accreting AGN,
including a pronounced big blue bump and strong optical/UV emission along with
a steep X-ray continuum. We classify the sources into radio-quiet,
radio-intermediate, and radio-loud categories, observing that
radio-intermediate and a subsample of radio-quiet AGN show a significant far-IR
excess over the radio-quiet SED and the far-IR excess appears to be related to
the prominence of Feii emission. There is an overall consistency between the
new SED and the one obtained for high Eddington ratio quasars in previous work.
We provide the SEDs in digital format for eventual applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23768v1" target="_blank"><h2>Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First
  Star Formation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Meng-Yuan Ho, Ke-Jung Chen, Pei-Cheng Tung</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to the AAS Journals</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15
minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at
redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations
incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from
the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required
resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the
resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas
and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\
\text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion
during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong
turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark
matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach
numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic
turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense
clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse
into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a
common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy
star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function
of the first stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23551v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Intracluster Light of Abell 3667: Unveiling an Optical Bridge in
  LSST Precursor Data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Anthony Englert, Ian Dell'Antonio, Mireia Montes</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Intracluster light, the diffuse glow of stars stripped from galaxies during a
cluster's formation, is an established tracer of a cluster's dynamical history.
The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
is set to revolutionize studies of intracluster light by imaging the entire
southern sky down to a limiting surface brightness $\mu \gtrsim
30\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2$ by year ten. In this letter, we create a
precursor LSST dataset (reaching the equivalent of year eight depth) using
DECam observations of Abell 3667 and study its intracluster light. We have
discovered a low surface brightness ($ \mu \gtrsim 26\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2
$) optical bridge extending over $\sim 400\text{ kpc}$ which connects the two
brightest galaxies (BCG1 and BCG2) in the cluster; the color and surface
brightness of the bridge is consistent with formation via a major merger. The
inner regions of BCG1 ($r < 200\text{ kpc}$) and BCG2 ($r < 50\text{ kpc}$) are
consistent with formation via gradual stripping of satellite galaxies, but
BCG2's outer profile appears disrupted by a recent merger. We hypothesize that
the bridge is a relic of a recent first-pass between the two brightest galaxies
and is composed of stars being stripped from BCG2. Future studies of
intracluster light with LSST will discover new features such as the bridge in
local clusters while enabling detailed studies of the stellar populations of
these features with its six photometric bands.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23221v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Chemical Clock of High-mass Star-forming Regions: N2H+/CCS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

JN = 87-76 and 77-66 lines toward a large sample of ultracompact HII regions
(UC HIIs). Among our 88 UC HIIs, 87 and 33 sources were detected in the N2H+ J
= 1-0 and CCS JN = 87-76 lines, respectively. For the CCS 77-66 transition, we
detected emission in 10 out of 82 targeted sources, all of which also exhibited
emission in the CCS JN = 87-76 line. Physical parameters are derived for our
detections, including the optical depth and excitation temperature of N2H+, the
rotational temperature of CCS and the column density. Combining our results and
previous observation results in different stages of high-mass star-forming
regions (HMSFRs), we found that the column density ratio N(N2H+)/N(CCS)
increases from high-mass starless cores (HMSCs) through high-mass protostellar
cores (HMPOs) to UC HIIs. This implies that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) can trace the
evolution process of HMSFRs. It was supported by our gas-grain chemical model,
which shows that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) increases with the evolution age of HMSFRs. The
temperature, density and chemical age were also constrained from our best-fit
model at each stage. Thus, we propose N(N2H+)/N(CCS) as a reliable chemical
clock of HMSFRs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23526v1" target="_blank"><h2>Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nathan Secrest, Sebastian von Hausegger, Mohamed Rameez, Roya Mohayaee, Subir Sarkar</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 5 figures; Submitted to Reviews of Modern Physics</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and
isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current
standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification
yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and
time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological
observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The
validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can
now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of
radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the
large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the
expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a
perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed
dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole
agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger,
demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear
isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy
in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in
significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases,
systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to
help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a
serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in
particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23306v1" target="_blank"><h2>Compartmentalization in the Dark Sector of the Universe after DESI DR2

components of the universe. In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark
matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a
constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the
two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark
energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic
expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model
fits the data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model, with
$\chi_{\text{model}}^{2}-\chi_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike
Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive
$\text{AIC}_{\operatorname{model}}-\text{AIC}_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}=-1$, from
which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by
the data than the $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically
significant.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23005v1" target="_blank"><h2>CHEX-MATE: The Impact of Triaxiality and Orientation on Planck SZ

Sereno</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxy cluster abundance measurements are a valuable tool for constraining
cosmological parameters like the mass density ($\Omega_m$) and density
fluctuation amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Wide area surveys detect clusters based on
observables, such as the total integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signal
($Y_{SZ}$) in the case of Planck. Quantifying the survey selection function is
necessary for a cosmological analysis, with completeness representing the
probability of detecting a cluster as a function of its intrinsic properties.
Employing a Monte-Carlo method, we inject triaxial cluster profiles into random
positions within the Planck all-sky maps, and subsequently determine the
completeness of the Planck-selected CHEXMATE sample as a function of both
geometry and SZ brightness. This is then used to generate 1000 mock CHEX-MATE
cluster catalogs, and the distribution of shapes and orientations of the
detected clusters, along with any associated bias in weak lensing-derived mass
($M_{WL}$) due to this orientation-dependent selection, denoted as $1 -
b_{\chi}$, is obtained. We show that cluster orientation impacts completeness,
with a higher probability of detecting clusters elongated along the line of
sight (LOS). This leads to $1 - b_{\chi}$ values of $0-4\%$ for CHEXMATE
clusters relative to a random population. The largest increase in $M_{WL}$ is
observed in the lowest mass objects, which are most impacted by
orientation-related selection bias. This bias is relevant for upcoming SZ
surveys like CMB-S4, and should be considered for surveys utilizing other
probes for cluster detection, such as Euclid.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23402v1" target="_blank"><h2>A view of the CIZA J2242.8+5301 galaxy cluster at very low radio

that hosts prominent double radio relics including the famous sausage relic, as
well as other diffuse radio sources. Observations at frequencies below 100 MHz
are essential for investigating the physics of radio relics as they provide
unique access to the low-energy population of cosmic-ray electrons. We aim to
study the morphology, spectral characteristics, and physical processes that
produce relics. We present the first observations of the Sausage cluster at 45
MHz, the lowest radio frequency at which this cluster has been studied to date,
using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) of the LOFAR radio interferometer. We made use
of ten hours of LOFAR LBA observations, from which we achieved a thermal-noise
limited radio image with a noise level of 1.5 mJy/beam at a resolution of 15
arcsec. These data were combined with existing multi-frequency measurements at
higher frequencies: LOFAR High Band Antenna, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope,
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. This
broad frequency coverage allowed us to derive integrated spectral indices,
spectral index and curvature maps, and Mach number distributions across the
relics. We derived Mach numbers from the local injection index measure using
low-frequency data with M_N = 2.9 +-0.5 for the northern relic and M_S =
2.9+-0.8 for the southern relic. LOFAR LBA observations reveal a remarkably
symmetric surface brightness profile across the eastern part of the northern
relic, with wings extending on either side of the peak. This discovery is
contrary to the expectation of particle acceleration at a single, sharp shock
and the subsequent downstream advection of accelerated electrons. We modelled
the surface brightness profile, including the effects of projection, magnetic
field variation, and shock deformation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23739v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital

Pessah, Bence Kocsis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied
to the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of
black holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc
by performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc
crossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations
$i\in[2^\circ,15^\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake
that forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We
identify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry
of the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake
morphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The
inclination damping $\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as
a power law in $\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\text{H,0}$ as $\Delta
i/i \propto m_{\rm H,0}^{0.4} \sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated
by the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until
accretion effects become comparable at $\sin(i)\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where
$H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations
($\sin(i)\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading
to a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest
that the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only
episodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying
inclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than
previously thought.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23382v1" target="_blank"><h2>Toward a simultaneous resolution of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions: early
  dark energy and an interacting dark sector model</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mai Yashiki</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The tension between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and that measured from late-time observations, such
as the local distance ladder, is a major challenge in modern cosmology. Early
dark energy (EDE) has been proposed as a possible resolution to the $H_0$
tension, but it typically worsens the $S_8$ tension by enhancing the
small-scale matter power spectrum due to an increased cold dark matter density.
To address this issue, we propose a model that combines EDE with an interacting
dark energy-dark matter (iDEDM) scenario, and investigate whether this mixed
model can simultaneously resolve both tensions. We find that the DE-DM
interaction suppress the growth of structure and reduce $S_8$, while EDE
contributes to increase $H_0$, although less effectively than in the EDE-only
case. Our MCMC analysis using Planck 2018, DESI BAO, DES, Pantheon+, and SH0ES
data shows that the mixed model provides modest improvements in both tensions,
although it does not fully resolve either. This limitation appears to stem from
the fact that both EDE and iDEDM independently favor a higher present-day
matter density, which reduces the angular diameter distance and limits the
degree to which EDE can lower the sound horizon.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23544v1" target="_blank"><h2>Metagalactic Ultraviolet Background Tables for Calculating Diffuse

Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This work presents a formalism for deriving likelihoods of the cosmological
density field directly from first principles within Perturbation Theory (PT).
By assuming a perturbative expansion around the Gaussian initial density field
and additional stochastic components, we analytically compute two forms of the
likelihood. Full marginalization over all underlying fields yields the
likelihood of the observed density field, expressed in terms of its summary
statistics (such as the power spectrum and bispectrum), which are naturally
given by the formalism, and conditioned on model parameters. Marginalizing only
over the stochastic fields results in the field-level likelihood. A key
strength of this method is its ability to automatically specify the precise
combinations of initial field covariances and PT expansion kernels required at
each perturbative order (e.g., tree-level power spectrum and bispectrum, and
the 1-loop power spectrum). This guarantees that the resulting likelihoods are
fully consistent with PT at the chosen order of accuracy, avoiding ad-hoc
choices in constructing the statistical model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22951v1" target="_blank"><h2>MOA-2022-BLG-091Lb and KMT-2024-BLG-1209Lb: Microlensing planets

KMT-2024-BLG-1209 exhibit anomalies with very similar features. These anomalies
appear near the peaks of the light curves, where the magnifications are
moderately high, and are distinguished by weak caustic-crossing features with
minimal distortion while the source remains inside the caustic. To achieve a
deeper understanding of these anomalies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis
of the lensing events. We carried out binary-lens modeling with a thorough
exploration of the parameter space. This analysis revealed that the anomalies
in both events are of planetary origin, although their exact interpretation is
complicated by different types of degeneracy. In the case of MOA-2022-BLG-091,
the main difficulty in the interpretation of the anomaly arises from a newly
identified degeneracy related to the uncertain angle at which the source
trajectory intersects the planet-host axis. For KMT-2024-BLG-1209, the
interpretation is affected by the previously known inner-outer degeneracy,
which leads to ambiguity between solutions in which the source passes through
either the inner or outer caustic region relative to the planet host. Bayesian
analysis indicates that the planets in both lens systems are giant planets with
masses about 2 to 4 times that of Jupiter, orbiting early K-type main-sequence
stars. Both systems are likely located in the Galactic disk at a distance of
around 4 kiloparsecs. The degeneracy in KMT-2024-BLG-1209 is challenging to
resolve because it stems from intrinsic similarities in the caustic structures
of the degenerate solutions. In contrast, the degeneracy in MOA-2022-BLG-091,
which occurs by chance rather than from inherent characteristics, is expected
to be resolved by the future space based Roman RGES microlensing survey.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23712v1" target="_blank"><h2>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Mark P.
