(SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the
high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have
reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity,
and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts.
It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played
by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of
high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The
ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star
formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation
(MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical
galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger
trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with
up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z
\sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm
M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe,
(pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF
follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find
$m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed
MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where
the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo
binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$)
stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment
histories of high-$z$ galaxies. We also discuss their implications for
transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06418v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Identification of Two JWST/NIRCam-Dark Starburst Galaxies at $z=6.6$

Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We analyze two dusty star-forming galaxies at $z=6.6$. These galaxies are
selected from the ASPIRE survey, a JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large
program targeting 25 quasars and their environments at $z\simeq6.5 - 6.8$.
These galaxies are identified as companions to UV-luminous quasars and robustly
detected in ALMA continuum and [C II] emission, yet they are extraordinarily
faint at the NIRCam wavelengths (down to $>28.0$ AB mag in the F356W band).
They are more obscured than galaxies like Arp220, and thus we refer to them as
"NIRCam-dark" starburst galaxies (star formation rate $\simeq 80 -
250\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). Such galaxies are typically missed
by (sub)-millimeter blank-field surveys. From the star-formation history (SFH),
we show that the NIRCam-dark galaxies are viable progenitors of massive
quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim4$ and descendants of UV-luminous galaxies at
$z>10$. Although it is hard to constrain their number density from a quasar
survey, we conclude that NIRCam-dark galaxies can be as abundant as
$n\sim10^{-5.5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ assuming a light halo occupation model. If true,
this would equal to $\sim$30% of the number densities of both the quiescent
galaxies at $z\gtrsim4$ and UV-luminous galaxies at $z>10$. We further predict
that analogs at $z\sim8$ should exist according to the SFH of early massive
quiescent galaxies. However, they may fall below the current detection limits
of wide JWST and ALMA surveys, thus remaining "JWST-dark". To fully trace the
evolution of massive galaxies and dust-obscured cosmic star formation at
$z\gtrsim8$, wide-field JWST/NIRCam imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys
of early protoclusters are essential.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05470v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing neutral outflows in z ~ 2 galaxies using JWST observations of Ca

first systematic investigation of neutral gas content in massive galaxies at
Cosmic Noon based on the Ca II H, K absorption lines. We analyze a sample of 9
galaxies at 1.8 < z < 2.8 with stellar masses > 10.6, for which we detect
neutral gas absorption both in Ca II and in Na I. After removing the stellar
continuum using the best-fit model obtained with Prospector, we fit the excess
absorption due to neutral gas in the Ca II H, K doublet and in the Na I D
doublet, together with nearby emission lines produced by ionized gas. We
measure covering fractions between 0.2 and 0.9 from the Ca II H and K lines,
which are spectrally well resolved in the NIRSpec R ~ 1000 observations, unlike
the absorption lines in the Na I D doublet. We measure the velocity shift,
velocity dispersion, and column density separately for Ca II and Na I. About
half of the galaxies present blueshifted Ca II, indicative of an outflow of
neutral gas, consistent with previous results based on Na I. The velocity shift
and the column density measured from Ca II are correlated with those measured
from Na I, implying that these absorption lines trace gas in similar physical
conditions. However, the column densities are not in a 1:1 relation, meaning
that the relative amount of Ca II and Na I atoms along the line of sight varies
with the gas column density. After discussing possible reasons for this
behavior, we derive an empirical relation between the column density of Ca II
and the column density of Na I and, in a more indirect way, of neutral hydrogen
H I. This calibration offers a new way to estimate the outflow mass and the
mass outflow rate for the neutral phase from current and future JWST

Privon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The compact mm emission ubiquitously found in radio-quiet active galactic
nuclei (RQ AGN) exhibits properties consistent with synchrotron radiation from
a small region ($\leq$1 light day) and undergoing self-absorption below
$\sim$100 GHz. Several scenarios have been proposed for its origin, including
an X-ray corona, a scaled-down jet, or outflow-driven shocks, which can be
tested via mm polarimetry. In the optically thin regime, synchrotron emission
is expected to show polarization up to $\sim$70\%, but disordered magnetic
fields and Faraday rotation reduce this to a few percent for jets and outflows,
while an X-ray corona is likely to result in complete depolarization. To
investigate this, we conducted the first ALMA Band 3 full-polarization
observations of three RQ AGN - NGC 3783, MCG 5-23-16, and NGC 4945. No
polarized signal was detected in any of the AGN, with an upper limit of
0.5-1.5\%, supporting the X-ray corona scenario. However, we detected a compact
source with 17\% polarization in NGC 3783, 20 pc away from the AGN, co-spatial
with the mm and narrow-line outflow, likely linked to a shock propagating
through the outflowing material. Additionally, combining our data with archival
ALMA observations, we found typical mm variability in RQ AGN by a factor of 2;
however, the sparsity of the data prevented a more detailed analysis of the
total flux variability.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05591v1" target="_blank"><h2>Survival of dust in super-dusty galaxies at redshifts $z \approx 5-8$</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuri A. Shchekinov, Biman B. Nath</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 28 pages, 12 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The presence of dust in galaxies at redshifts $z>5$ is commonly connected
with core collapse supernovae (SN). Galaxies with exceptionally large dust
mass, of order of $1 - 3$\% of the galaxy stellar mass, have been detected
during the last decade. The required SN dust yield is $\gtrsim 1~M_\odot$ per
supernova, which is comparable to the theoretically predicted maximum. However,
the reverse shock (RS) penetrating the SN ejecta significantly destroy the dust
particles nucleating there through sputtering. The resulting net dust mass
injected into the interstellar gas after processing by the RS turns out to be
$\lesssim 0.1~M_\odot$ per SN. This makes the explanation of the existence of
$z>5$ galaxies with dust masses as high as $M_d\gtrsim (0.01-0.03)M_\ast$ a
challenging one. In this paper we present arguments in favor of an efficient
inhibition of the sputtering behind the RS, caused by a strong radiation
cooling from the dust in the supernova ejecta.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07432v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on cosmology and baryonic feedback with joint analysis of

obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey
and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear
(which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the
projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and
the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of
baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ
cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after
minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By
jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the
shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$
and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary
CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas
pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}/h$,
supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas
thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a
$2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild
baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally,
we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear

of the three ULIRGs that are currently known to host an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) with young radio jets. We present a detailed study of the link between
galaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and galactic-scale molecular
outflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and
$^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging.
The latter allows us to put - for the first time - tight constraints on the
assembly history of the system, confirming that it formed through a major
merger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde
encounter and no older than 2 Gyr. The recent merger channelled about
$(1.0\pm0.1)\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas in the central regions
of the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between
the CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely
contributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio
jets, which are no older than 2 Myr. Furthermore, by comparing the relative
strength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e.
$T_{\rm ex}\gg50$ K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM
interaction. A qualitative study of the CO kinematics also demonstrates that,
despite the overall disturbed dynamical state with no clear signs of regular
rotation, at least one non-rotational kinematic component can be identified and
likely associated to an outflow with $v_{\rm out}\approx 556$ km s$^{-1}$ and
$\dot{M_{\rm out}}\approx 110$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04757v1" target="_blank"><h2>Modelling the selection of galaxy groups with end to end simulations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  R.

its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their
binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The
XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray
(ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical
simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is
essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling
the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu
simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a
neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching
observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population.
Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray
luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a
velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is
driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and
redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We
calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation
and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about
0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich
systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for
groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray
follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing
completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors
dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the
comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups
and hydro simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05474v1" target="_blank"><h2>Jellyfish galaxies with the IllustrisTNG simulations -- Supermassive
  black hole activity in dense environments with ram-pressure stripped

Joshi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 9 figures + 3 appendices with 3 figures. Submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Jellyfish galaxies are extreme examples of how galaxies can transform due to
dense environmental effects. These satellite galaxies suffer from ram-pressure
stripping, leading to the formation of their distinctive gaseous tails. Some
recent observational studies find that jellyfish galaxies are more likely to
host active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to central galaxies of the same
mass, suggesting a link between ram pressure and supermassive black hole (SMBH)
accretion. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological-magnetohydrodynamical
simulations, namely TNG50 and TNG100, to explore the presence of AGN in
jellyfish galaxies with $M_{\rm{stellar}}\simeq10^{9.5-10.8}\,\rm{M}_\odot$ at
redshift $z=0$ from the Zooniverse "Cosmological Jellyfish" citizen-science
project. Compared to central galaxies, jellyfish are more likely to host an AGN
($L_{\rm AGN}\geq10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) particularly at high stellar
masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Jellyfish are also
more likely to host an AGN than satellites of the same mass, largely because
many satellite galaxies are gas-poor and therefore have lower SMBH accretion
rates. Compared to non-jellyfish satellites with similar gas content, jellyfish
typically undergo stronger ram pressure and have higher central gas densities
along with lower central gas sound speeds, although these effects are smaller
at lower stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\lesssim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$).
Together with case studies of individual galaxies, our population analysis
indicates that ram pressure can play a key role in fuelling AGN activity in a
large fraction of jellyfish, where gas compression can lead to intense episodes
of AGN feedback and star formation. Thus, it is essential to consider both
environmental and secular processes for a more complete picture of satellite
galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05448v1" target="_blank"><h2>Multi-cloud crushing -- the collective survival of cold clouds in

role in the dynamics of multiphase galactic winds. Recent numerical studies
incorporating radiative cooling have identified a size threshold for idealized
cold clouds to survive within high-velocity outflows. This study extends the
investigation to a more complex morphology of cold gas as observed in the
interstellar medium. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of
ensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which
conditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can
survive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be
rapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors
such as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation
facilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that
accounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas
mass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling
fraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a
composite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind,
incorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions
scale with the critical survival radius $r_{\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud
criterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\rm crit}}\approx 0.24$ that
robustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric
configurations. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of initial cloud
distribution and fragmentation in governing the long-term evolution and
survival of cold gas structures, providing insight into observed multiphase
outflows and CGM dynamics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06149v2" target="_blank"><h2>Faint absorption of the ground state hyperfine-splitting transitions of

wavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line
at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21
cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large
range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with
respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity
and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We
identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet
several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of
[CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one
sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across
diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity
limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular
gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH
absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper
observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full
potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an
exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting
transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we
detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the
OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand,
and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides
additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures

He$^+$ ionization in the galaxy could be driven by small pockets of young
Population III stars or low-metallicity Very Massive Stars (VMSs) rather than
AGN or metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. The galaxy has a highly ionized ISM

significant [SII] deficiency ([SII]6718,6732/H$\alpha$ = 0.08$\pm$0.02,

leaking of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. Our best-fit SED model also
infers a high nebular ionization (log U = $-2.0$) and a low stellar mass M =

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions
(GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond
the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support
recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated
sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to $z\sim
7.5$, mapping the Universe's expansion over $95\%$ of its current age. In this
{\it Letter} we use these sources for model selection, and show that the
$R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is strongly favored by this probe over both
flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion
probabilities of, respectively, $91.8\%$, $7.4\%$ and $0.8\%$. A possible
caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm
int}$, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons.
We find that the inclusion of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ as an additional, optimizable
parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ about
equal, though at the expense of creating $\sim 2.5\sigma$ tension between our
inferred matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and its {\it Planck}-optimized value.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07978v1" target="_blank"><h2>Not so dark, not so dense: an alternative explanation for the lensing

dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially
challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these
analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility
that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis
of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite.
Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo
properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that
are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite
also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While
high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically
preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while
also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical
expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that
neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are
artificially compact.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06272v1" target="_blank"><h2>To collapse or not to collapse: Halo evolution with self-interacting

field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be
difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those
objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos
consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple
models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact
objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase,
where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos
while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe which typical SIDM models are
subject to. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM
model consisting of two species with unequal masses, featuring only
interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing
$N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the
evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its
evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our
two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on
the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, the mass segregation caused by the
unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a
slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction
of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can
simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are
denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the
gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species
models, offering a rich phenomenology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07783v1" target="_blank"><h2>Traces of the evolution of cosmic void galaxies: An Integral Field
  Spectroscopy based analysis</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Agustín M. Rodríguez-Medrano, Dante J. Paz, Damián Mast, Federico A. Stasyszyn, Andrés N. Ruiz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies in the most underdense regions of the Universe, known as cosmic
voids, exhibit astrophysical properties that suggest a distinct evolutionary
path compared to galaxies in denser environments. Numerical simulations
indicate that the assembly of void galaxies occurs later, leading to galaxies
with younger stellar populations, low metallicities, and a high gas content in
their halos, which provides the fuel to sustain elevated star formation
activity. Our objective in this work is to test these numerical predictions
with observational data by comparing galaxies in voids with galaxies in
non-void environments. We used voids identified in SDSS data and galaxies from
the MaNGA survey, which provides galaxies with integral field spectroscopy
(IFS). We separated the galaxies into void and non-void samples, mimicked the
magnitude distribution, and compared their integrated astrophysical properties
as well as the metallicity and age profiles through a stacking technique, ETGs
and LTGs separately. We find that void galaxies have younger and less
metal-rich stellar populations. Regarding gas mass, we do not find differences
across environments. When dividing galaxies into ETGs and LTGs, we observe that
ETGs show negative gradients in both age and metallicity, with void galaxies
consistently appearing younger and less metal-rich. For LTGs, age gradients are
also negative, showing younger populations in void galaxies. However, we do not
find statistically significant differences in stellar metallicity gradients
between void and non-void environments. Our results show how the astrophysical
properties of galaxies in voids differ from those of galaxies in the rest of
the Universe. This suggests that the void environment plays a role in the
evolution of its galaxies, delaying their assembly and growth.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06269v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Moritz S.

(DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly
compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions,
halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the
central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse
phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand
numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter
(SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better
understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body
simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external
gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of
the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to
energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially
speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can
describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have
simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we
make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the
current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late
collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g.
that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to
run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations
of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05506v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the halo occupation distribution for moderate X-ray luminosity

function of separation, which is strongly influenced by quasar host halo
masses. The empirical Trinity model recently inferred the redshift-dependent
relationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, galaxy mass, and halo
mass, using constraints other than correlation functions (e.g., quasar
luminosity functions, active galactic nuclei occupation fractions, and SMBH
mass-bulge mass relations). Hence, comparing the predicted quasar correlation
functions from Trinity to real observations is an important test of Trinity's
inferred SMBH -- halo relation. In this work, we use a compilation of observed
two-point projected and redshift-space correlation functions from $0 \leq z
\leq 3.5$. We find that Trinity accurately predicts quasar correlation
functions within observed error bars, although observations do not have much
constraining power at lower redshifts due to smaller observable volumes and
lower quasar number densities. This finding is consistent with Trinity having
the correct placement of quasars within their host galaxies and dark matter
halos, without requiring quasar clustering constraints during model fitting.
Using Trinity, we also predict the clustering as a function of quasar
bolometric luminosity, finding that existing survey uncertainties are too large
to show measurable differences ($\lesssim 0.3$ dex change in bias for $10^{42}$
erg s$^{-1}$ compared to $10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ SMBHs across redshifts). This
fact arises because most SMBH growth (and hence quasar luminosity) occurs in
halos in a similar mass range ($10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot$).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07161v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Composite Broad-Line Region in SDSS J1609+4902: a Double-Peaked Disk

critical insights into the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region
(BLR), which in turn influence the uncertainties in estimating the masses of
central supermassive black holes. In this study, we report the discovery of a
low-luminosity AGN, SDSS J1609+4902, in which the H$\alpha$ line exhibits two
distinct BLR components: a Gaussian component and an extremely broad
double-peaked component. Follow-up observations conducted at the Lijiang
Observatory in 2025 reveal that the line profile remains roughly unchanged,
suggesting that this BLR structure may remain stable over a timescale of
$\sim$10 years. We find that the size of the central Gaussian (Full Width at
Half Maximum, FWHM$\sim 3000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) component is consistent with
the classical reverberation mapping correlation. In contrast, the asymmetric
double-peaked wing (FWHM$\sim 23,000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) likely originates
from a disk-like BLR with an inner radius of approximately 70 gravitational
radii. These results provide new constraints on the structure and dynamics of
BLRs in AGNs and highlight the potential for long-term stability in such
systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07457v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Internal Kinematics, Stellar Population, and Gas-phase Properties of

comprehensive analysis of the central stellar velocity dispersion, stellar
population properties, star formation history, and gas-phase chemical
abundances in AGC721966, a unique ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) harboring a
pseudobulge. Our findings reveal that the pseudobulge formed in the early
universe but underwent a recent episode of rejuvenated star formation. The
system exhibits a mass-weighted (light-weighted) stellar population age of
$\tau_{\star}\sim 7.4\pm2.5$ ($2.9\pm1.5$)~Gyr, a stellar metallicity of
[M/H]$\sim -0.62\pm0.26$ ($-0.55\pm0.20$), an $\alpha$-element enhancement of
[$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim 0.36\pm0.09$ ($0.37\pm0.07$), and a gas-phase oxygen
abundance of \Oabund$\sim 8.15\pm0.03$. The central stellar velocity dispersion
is measured as $\sigma_{\rm c}\sim 57.9\pm15.7$~km/s. These results provide
robust evidence supporting the early halo-halo merging formation scenario
proposed by \cite{Rong25}, while unequivocally ruling out the ``failed''
$L^{\star}$ formation model, at least for AGC721966. Furthermore, through
systematic application of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we establish that
these pseudobulge-hosting UDGs are neither misidentified nuclear star
cluster-bearing dwarf galaxies nor bulge-dominated massive galaxies, thereby
affirming their distinct evolutionary pathway.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04747v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Centre of Attention: a Powerful Radio Galaxy Pinpoints a NIR-Dark

radio galaxy with luminosity, $L_{500 MHz}=1.3\times10^{28}$ ${W Hz}^{-1}$.
This source is part of a sample of candidate high redshift radio galaxies with
bright radio fluxes, $S_{150MHz}>0.1$ Jy, but host galaxies with
$K_s({AB})\gtrsim23$ mag. The molecular gas associated with the radio galaxy
host has two kinematically separate components, likely in-falling and
indicative of a recent interaction or merger with another galaxy. One 100-GHz
continuum source $\sim120$ pkpc away is found to have both CO(4-3) and
[CI](1-0) emission lines and a further five protocluster members are identified
from CO(4-3) emission alone, all at similar redshift ($\Delta v<700$ km
s$^{-1}$) and within a radius of $1.1^{\prime}$. Using photometry from the High
Acuity Widefield K-band Imager $K_s$-band and the Dark Energy Survey $g, r, i,
z$ and $Y$ bands, we find this protocluster harbours a rare, optically-dark,
very massive $M_*\sim10^{12}$ ${M}_\odot$ galaxy. Comparisons with the TNG300

Peiris, Sinan Deger</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A significant number of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with redshifts 3 < z < 5
are expected to be observed by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This will enable us to probe the universe at
higher redshifts than is currently possible with cosmological galaxy clustering
and weak lensing surveys. However, accurate inference of cosmological
parameters requires precise knowledge of the redshift distributions of selected
galaxies, where the number of faint objects expected from LSST alone will make
spectroscopic based methods of determining these distributions extremely
challenging. To overcome this difficulty, it may be possible to leverage the
information in the large volume of photometric data alone to precisely infer
these distributions. This could be facilitated using forward models, where in
this paper we use stellar population synthesis (SPS) to estimate uncertainties
on LBG redshift distributions for a 10 year LSST (LSSTY10) survey. We
characterise some of the modelling uncertainties inherent to SPS by introducing
a flexible parameterisation of the galaxy population prior, informed by
observations of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and cosmic star
formation density (CSFRD). These uncertainties are subsequently marginalised
over and propagated to cosmological constraints in a Fisher forecast. Assuming
a known dust attenuation model for LBGs, we forecast constraints on the sigma8
parameter comparable to Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04570v1" target="_blank"><h2>RIDEN pilot survey: broad-band selection of candidate quasars with

constructed a broad-band Ly$\alpha$ imaging toward 483 SDSS/BOSS quasars at
$z=$ 1.9-3.0, using deep, wide-field ultraviolet to near-infrared ($u$-to-$K$)
data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey (HSC-SSP), the CFHT
Large Area U-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS), the Deep UKIRT Near-Infrared Steward

broad-band selection allowed us to select 24 candidate quasar nebulae that
exhibit $u$ or $g$ band excess over 50-170 kpc, some of which exhibit
asymmetrical extended features similar to those seen in previously discovered
giant nebulae. We then investigated whether the Ly$\alpha$ morphology of quasar
nebulae differs between two redshift intervals, $z=$ 1.9-2.3 and $z=$ 2.3-3.0,
and examined environmental dependence based on a control sample. Comparison
results show no significant difference in asymmetry within Ly$\alpha$ nebulae
between the two redshift intervals. Furthermore, we found no systematic
differences in overdensities around the complete quasar samples, quasars with
large Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, and control samples, while the most extended nebula
appears to be located in the high-density region. Further verification analyses
are required since the current dataset lacks spectroscopic confirmation for
both quasar nebulae and their surrounding neighbours. Nevertheless, the results
demonstrate the great potential of the Rubin LSST to discover giant Ly$\alpha$

a nuclear star cluster that are embedded in the larger Galactic bar. These
stellar systems overlap spatially, which makes it challenging to separate stars
that belong to the nuclear stellar systems, to deduce their internal dynamics,
and to derive the central Galactic potential. Discrete stellar kinematics probe
the mass distribution of a stellar system, and chemical tracers such as stellar
metallicity can further separate multiple stellar populations that can have
distinct kinematic properties. We took advantage of the information provided by
discrete stellar kinematics and the metallicity in the Galactic centre using
discrete chemo-dynamical modelling. We fitted axisymmetric Jeans models to
discrete data of 4,600 stars. We fitted the stars as either one population plus
a background component or as two populations plus a background that represents
the bar. We tested the robustness of the inferred gravitational potential
against a varying mass of the supermassive black hole, including dark matter,
or a radially varying mass-to-light ratio. We obtained robust results on the
fit with a single population and a background component. We obtained a
supermassive black hole mass of (4.35$\pm 0.24) \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$, and we
find that a dark matter component and radial variation in the mass-to-light
ratio are negligible. We derived the enclosed mass profile of the inner ~60 pc
and found a lower mass than reported in the literature in the region of ~5-30
pc. In our two-population fit, we found a high-[M/H] population that
contributes more than 90% to the total stellar density. The properties of the
high-[M/H] population are consistent with in situ formation after gas inflow
from the Galactic disc via the bar. The distinct kinematic properties of the

S. Suryan Sivadas, Charles Jose</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 11 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The halo model provides a powerful framework for interpreting galaxy
clustering by linking the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes to the
underlying matter distribution. A key assumption within the linear bias
approximation of the halo model is that the halo bias between two halo
populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this
work, we test the validity of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear
scales using both simulations and observational data. Unlike previous studies,
we explicitly disentangle the effects of scale dependence of the bias to assess
the robustness of bias separability across a broad range of halo masses and
redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or
galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability,
and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from
separability on quasi-linear scales ($\sim$ 1-5 Mpc) at high redshifts ($z \geq
3$), leading to enhancements in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2
-- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest.
Additionally, using high-redshift ($z \sim 3.6$) galaxy samples, we detect
deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation
predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear
scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for
non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime.
Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy
cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from
upcoming large-scale surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07038v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Milky Way in context: The formation of galactic discs and chemical

Grand, Volker Springel</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 15 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We study the formation of chemical sequences in the stellar disc of Milky Way
(MW)-mass galaxies in a full cosmological context with the Auriga simulations.
We focus on the conditions giving rise to bi-modal $\alpha$-chemistry in the MW
disc and the potential influence of mergers (e.g. Gaia-Enceladus, GSE). We find
a wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the
emergence of dichotomous $\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The
transition between multiple $\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated
by modulations in the star formation rate (SFR). In some cases, this can be
caused by the starburst and subsequent quiescence induced by mergers. In
others, by exhaustion or violent disruption of the gas disc. Realisations with
singular sequences either lack significant modulations in their SFR, or form
too late to have a significant high-$\alpha$ sequence. The metallicity overlap
between the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar
neighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the
circum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs
losing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger
events are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\Delta\text{[Fe/H]}
\gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\alpha$ sequence in
the MW. Finally, the shape of $\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe]
plane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is
observed in the low-$\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or
declining SFR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04799v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Impact of Cluster Mergers on Galaxy Properties</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Oğuzhan Çakır, Matt S.

passive population, while galaxy populations exhibit a clear segregation in the
relaxed clusters. Analysis of equivalent width of $\rm H\alpha$ line (EW($\rm
H\alpha$)), as a tracer of recent SF activity, does not reveal strong evidence
of triggered star formation activity as a function of dynamical state for both
the global cluster environment and subsamples of galaxies selected near
possible merger features. This suggests that the increase in $f_{SFG}$ is due
to the mixing of galaxies in dynamically complex, young merging systems that
are still forming, unlike their older, relaxed counterparts that have had
longer to quench.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06921v1" target="_blank"><h2>Teaching Astronomy with Large Language Models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuan-Sen Ting, Teaghan O'Briain</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> physics.ed-ph, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 8 figures, comments are welcome.

documented their AI usage through homework reflections and post-course surveys.
We analyzed student evolution in AI interaction strategies and conducted
experimental comparisons of LLM-assisted versus traditional grading methods.
LLM grading showed strong correlation with human evaluation while providing
more detailed and consistent feedback. We also piloted LLM-facilitated
interview-based examinations as a scalable alternative to traditional

addresses common testing limitations. Students experienced decreased rather

assistance-seeking to verification workflows, with documentation requirements
fostering metacognitive awareness. Students developed effective prompting

Our findings suggest that structured LLM integration with transparency

  very high redshift</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  James C. C. Wong</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 1 figure</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations of Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at very high redshift hosted
by massive galaxy provide a challenge to the SMBH and massive galaxy formation
models which are predicated on the Lambda CDM model that predicts a Hubble
constant currently in tension with late time observations. In a gravitational
system with two asymptotic solutions such as a central mass in an expanding
cosmological background or an expanding background with radiation and baryons,
we find that a particle's free falling speed resulting from adding the free
falling speeds due to the asymptotic solutions is also a theoretically viable
solution [1]-[2]. In this work, we use this new model to examine the SMBH
formation time-line and find that the change in the redshift-cosmological time
relation provides sufficent cosmological time for the formation of SMBHs at
high redshifts. We also find that the Hubble parameter-redshift relation in
this model is consistent with late time observation at z<1.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06249v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectroscopic Characterization of redMaPPer Galaxy Clusters with DESI</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  J.

Zhou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Optical galaxy cluster identification algorithms such as redMaPPer promise to
enable an array of astrophysical and cosmological studies, but suffer from
biases whereby galaxies in front of and behind a galaxy cluster are mistakenly
associated with the primary cluster halo. These projection effects caused by
irreducible photometric uncertainty must be quantified to facilitate the use of
optical cluster catalogues. We present measurements of galaxy cluster
projection effects and velocity dispersion using spectroscopy from the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Representative data from DESI enables
characterizing these properties of clusters identified with the redMaPPer
algorithm. Our findings are as follows: we confirm that the fraction of
redMaPPer putative member galaxies mistakenly associated with cluster haloes is
richness dependent, being more than twice as large at low richness than high
richness; we present the first spectroscopic evidence of an increase in
projection effects with increasing redshift, by as much as 25 per cent from
$z\sim0.1$ to $z\sim0.2$; moreover, we find qualitative evidence for luminosity
dependence in projection effects, with fainter galaxies being more commonly far
behind clusters than their bright counterparts; finally we fit the scaling
relation between measured mean spectroscopic richness and velocity dispersion,
finding an implied linear scaling between spectroscopic richness and halo mass.
We discuss further directions for the application of spectroscopic datasets to
improve use of optically selected clusters to test cosmological models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05986v1" target="_blank"><h2>Puzzling radial gradients of K-band absorption features in the giant

Sarzi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present new K-band spectroscopy for the giant elliptical galaxy M87 in the
Virgo cluster, taken with the LUCI spectrograph at the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT). The new data are used to study line-strengths of K-band
absorption features from different chemical species, namely Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, and
CO, as a function of galactocentric distance, out to 40arcsec from the center
(about half of the galaxy effective radius). The radial trends of spectral
indices are compared to those for the bulge of M31, observed with the same
instrument. For M87, most K-band indices exhibit flat radial profiles, with the
exception of NaI2.21, that decreases outwards, with a negative radial gradient.
Significant offsets are found between indices for M87 and those for the bulge
of M31, the latter having weaker line-strengths for almost all features, but Fe
and Ca, for which we find similar trends in both systems. We find that the
behavior of CO features - most prominent in giant stars - is difficult to
explain, consistent with previous results for the central regions of massive
galaxies. In particular, the CO indices are stronger in M87 than M31, and do
not exhibit significant radial gradients in M87, despite its IMF being bottom
heavier than M31 especially in its central region. Predictions of
state-of-the-art stellar population models, based on results from the optical
spectral range, are able to match only the Na and Ca indices of M87, while a
significant mismatch is found for all other indices. This shows that
state-of-the-art stellar population models should be improved significantly in
order to provide reliable constraints on the stellar population content of
galaxies in the NIR spectral range.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06171v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial Black Holes and the First Stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Julia Monika Koulen, Stefano Profumo, Nolan Smyth</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 4 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute a compelling dark matter candidate
whose gravitational effects could significantly influence early cosmic
structure formation. We investigate the impact of PBHs on Population III star
formation through detailed $N$-body and hydrodynamic simulations, extending
beyond previous semi-analytical approaches. Our results reveal a mass-dependent
dichotomy in PBH effects: massive PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^2 M_\odot$)
with sufficient abundance can accelerate structure formation and shift Pop III
formation to higher redshifts, potentially conflicting with observational
constraints from high-redshift galaxy surveys. Conversely, lower-mass PBHs can
induce tidal disruption of gas-rich minihalos, suppressing star formation and
delaying the cosmic dawn depending on their abundance. We quantify these
competing effects to derive new constraints on the PBH mass function and their
contribution to the total dark matter density, with implications for
forthcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and 21-cm
cosmology experiments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06711v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Voids to Clusters: Mergers and Evolutionary Pathways of

environmental factors, yet the role of environment and mergers in regulating
their growth and star formation rates remains poorly understood, especially in
the low-density regime. This study aims to compare the evolutionary pathways
and merger histories of star-forming and quenched galaxies in dense (cluster)
and under-dense (void) environments, focusing on galaxies with stellar masses
in the range $10^{8.5} \leq M_\star/M_\odot \leq 10^{10.5}$. It presents the
first statistical analysis within this stellar mass range, explicitly
distinguishing between mini, minor, and major mergers across varying
environments. Using the high-resolution TNG300-1 simulation from the
IllustrisTNG project, we classify galaxies as star-forming and quenched based
on sSFR and UVJ criteria. We track their physical properties over the last
$\sim 11.5$ Gyr ($z < 3$), follow their complete merger histories,
distinguishing between major, minor, and mini mergers, and assess the
statistical impact of these mergers on star formation, gas content, and the
mass assembly of their supermassive black holes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05459v1" target="_blank"><h2>RUBIES: A Spectroscopic Census of Little Red Dots; All V-Shaped Point

Appendix: 7 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The physical nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) - a population of compact, red
galaxies revealed by JWST - remains unclear. Photometric samples are
constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic
follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad
emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with
wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically
analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of
$\sim$1500 galaxies at $z > 3.1$. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel
fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra,
yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35%) at $z > 6$. A large subpopulation
naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting
`v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the
rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest
such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely
recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in
combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between
these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample
to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high
accuracy, down to $\rm F444W<26.5$, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were
previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint
rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain
photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic
campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric
criteria require refinement to capture the full population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06434v1" target="_blank"><h2>Distinct origins of environmentally quenched galaxies in the core and

Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> High-redshift ($z\sim1$) galaxy clusters are the domain where environmental
quenching mechanisms are expected to emerge as important factors in the
evolution of the quiescent galaxy population. Uncovering these initially subtle
effects requires exploring multiple dependencies of quenching across the
cluster environment, and through time. We analyse the stellar-mass functions
(SMFs) of 17 galaxy clusters within the GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys between
$0.8<z<1.5$, and with $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}>9.5$. The data are fit
simultaneously with a Bayesian model that allows the Schechter function
parameters of the quiescent and star-forming populations to vary smoothly with
cluster-centric radius and redshift. The model also fits the radial galaxy
number density profile of each population, allowing the global quenched
fraction to be parameterised as a function of redshift and cluster velocity
dispersion. We find the star-forming SMF to not depend on radius or redshift.
For the quiescent population however, there is $\sim2\sigma$ evidence for a
radial dependence. Outside the cluster core ($R>0.3\,R_{\rm200}$), the quenched
fraction above $\log{(M/{\rm{M_\odot}})}=9.5$ is $\sim40{\rm\;per\,cent}$, and
the quiescent SMF is similar in shape to the star-forming field. In contrast,
the cluster core has an elevated quenched fraction ($\sim70{\rm\;per\,cent}$),
and a quiescent SMF similar in shape to the quiescent field population. We
explore contributions of 'early mass-quenching' and mass-independent
'environmental-quenching' models in each of these radial regimes. The core is
well-described primarily by early mass-quenching, which we interpret as
accelerated quenching of massive galaxies in protoclusters, possibly through
merger-driven feedback mechanisms. The non-core is better described through
mass-independent, environmental-quenching of the infalling field population.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07425v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy Cluster Mass Estimation Through The Splashback Radius</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Lucas Gabriel-Silva, Laerte Sodré Jr</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ (2025)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present an analysis of the splashback radius ($R_{\text{sp}}$) and the
associated splashback mass ($M_{\text{sp}}$) for a sample of galaxy clusters
using SDSS spectroscopic data and mock simulations. $R_{\text{sp}}$ marks a
physical boundary between the virialized core and the outer infall regions of
clusters, providing a robust measure of cluster mass accretion history without
being affected by pseudo-evolution. We model the cumulative galaxy number
profile of clusters, testing different halo density models and considering the
impact of cluster properties, such as center definitions, magnitude limits,
galaxy colors, and field contamination, on the estimation of splashback
features. Our results show that observed splashback radii, measured in
projection (2D), are consistently smaller than predicted by dark matter
simulations, with $R_\text{sp}/R_{200m} \approx 1$, supporting previous
discrepancies in the literature. We also explore the relationship between
$M_{\text{sp}}$ and $R_{\text{sp}}$, proposing a new scaling relation for
future cosmological studies, as $R_{\text{sp}}$ is easily observable. Our
findings indicate that splashback masses strongly correlate with radii, with a
dispersion of $\approx 0.15$ dex, competitive with other mass-observable
relations. However, the fitted relation diverges from the constant density
expectations of galaxy clusters around $R_\text{sp}$. Additionally, the
$M_{\text{sp}} \textendash R_{\text{sp}}$ relation shows significant redshift
evolution, though the predominantly low-redshift range of our sample limits our
ability to confirm this trend conclusively. The approach developed here may
play a key role in cluster characterization and cosmology in the era of large
galaxy surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06118v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence for Hydrostatic Equilibrium in the Extragalactic Molecular

clouds in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, aligns with expectations
from hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE). This study
extends the study of the M31 clouds by matching their observed surface
densities to a spatially-averaged solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The
results affirm that the M31 molecular clouds exhibit density profiles expected
from HE, further supporting the earlier conclusion that VE holds at all radii
within the clouds. This study also discusses HE in the context of the turbulent
interstellar medium, considering energy balance, cloud lifetimes, and the
pressure of the interstellar medium. A comparison between the Galactic and
extragalactic clouds indicates that both share similar dynamical states. These
findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interplay between
turbulence, gravitational stability, and cloud evolution in the molecular
interstellar medium.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05575v1" target="_blank"><h2>A map of the outer gas disk of the Galaxy with direct distances from

Accepted by ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> For more than fifty years, astronomers have mapped the neutral hydrogen gas
in the Galaxy assuming kinematically derived distances. We employ the distances
of nearby young stars, which trace the gas from which they formed, in
longitude-latitude-velocity space to map this gas without using kinematic
distances. We denote this new method "pattern matching". Analysis of simulated
spiral galaxies indicates that our pattern matching distances are 24% more
accurate than kinematic distances for gas within 15 kpc of the Sun. The two
methods provide similar agreement with parallaxes towards these masers,
although the kinematic method shows a small systematic offset in the distance
that is not present in the pattern matching distance. Using parallaxes and
velocities for masers, we show that this novel method, when matched with nearby
Cepheids, performs well compared to kinematics. This analysis is restricted to
sources that have a reasonably good match with a member of our Cepheid sample.
The distances derived here, and the associated map, have broad utility - from
improving our understanding of star formation and the dynamical structure of
the Galaxy, to informing 3-D dust maps.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06424v1" target="_blank"><h2>Pavo: Stellar feedback in action in a low-mass dwarf galaxy</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Michael G.

Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in
archival HI single dish data. Based on the latest distance measurement
($2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc), we measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log
M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI
reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance
measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within
over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear
signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center
by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this
disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI
size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a
suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI
reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in
which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium
after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in
precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation
episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06865v1" target="_blank"><h2>FAUST XXVI. The dust opacity spectral indices of protostellar envelopes

Main text: 15 pp. (including 12 Fig., 4 Tab.); Appendix: 10 pp (Figures./Tables)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The sub-millimetre dust opacity spectral index is a critical observable to
constrain dust properties, such as the maximum grain size of an observed dust
population. It has been widely measured at galactic scales and down to
protoplanetary disks. However, because of observational and analytical
challenges, quite a gap exists in measuring dust properties in the envelopes
that feed newborn protostars and their disks. To fill this gap, we use
sensitive dust continuum emission data at 1.2 and 3.1 mm from the ALMA FAUST
Large Program and constrain the dust opacity millimetre spectral index around a
sample of protostars. Our high-resolution data, along with a more refined
methodology with respect to past efforts, allow us to disentangle disk and
envelope contributions in the uv-plane, and thus measure spectral indices for
the envelopes uncontaminated by the optically thick emission of the inner
regions. First, we find that the young disks are small and optically thick.
Secondly, we measure the dust opacity spectral index at envelope scales for
n=11 sources: the beta of n=9 sources had never been constrained in the
literature. We effectively double the number of sources for which the dust
opacity spectral index beta has been measured at these scales. Third, combining
the available literature measurements with our own (total n=18), we show how
envelope spectral indices distribute between ISM-like and disk-like values,
bridging the gap in the inferred dust evolution. Finally, we statistically
confirm a significant correlation between beta and the mass of protostellar
envelopes, previously suggested in the literature. Our findings indicate that
the dust optical properties smoothly vary from the ISM, through envelopes and
all the way down to disks. Multi-wavelength surveys are needed to further this
study and make more general claims on dust evolution in its pathway from cloud
to disks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07262v1" target="_blank"><h2>ALMA-JELLY I: High Resolution CO(2-1) Observations of Ongoing Ram

Analyzing this data alongside complimentary Subaru H$\alpha$ and HST (F600LP /
F350LP) observations, we find numerous structural and kinematic features
indicative of the effects from strong, inclined ram pressure, including an
asymmetric inner gas tail. We estimate a highly-inclined disk-wind angle of
$\phi_{DW} = 75^{+10}_{-27}$. By subtracting a simple circular velocity model,
we find (1): gas clumps that are being accelerated by ram pressure, and (2):
signatures of gas clumps that had been previously pushed out of the disk but
are now falling inwards. We also discuss head-tail morphologies in star
complexes within the stellar disk that appear to be RPS-influenced. Lastly, we
compare this galaxy to state-of-the-art galaxy ``wind tunnel'' simulations. We
find that this galaxy is one of the best nearby examples of strong and inclined
ram pressure gas stripping, and of gas that is perturbed by ram pressure but
not fully stripped and falls back. We emphasize the importance of torques due
to ram pressure in highly-inclined interactions, which help drive gas inwards
on the side rotating against the wind, contributing to the formation of
asymmetric inner RPS tails.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04671v1" target="_blank"><h2>CSST Cosmological Emulator III: Hybrid Lagrangian Bias Expansion

Telescope (CSST) survey to understand the structure growth and reveal the
nature of the dark sector. However, it is a long-term challenge to model this
biased tracer and connect the observable to the underlying physics. In this
work, we present a hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion emulator, combining the
Lagrangian bias expansion and the accurate dynamical evolution from $N$-body
simulation, to predict the power spectrum of the biased tracer in real space.
We employ the Kun simulation suite to construct the emulator, emulating across
the space of 8 cosmological parameters including dynamic dark energy $w_0$,
$w_a$, and total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. The sample variance due to the
finite simulation box is further reduced using the Zel'dovich variance control,
and it enables the precise measurement of the Lagrangian basis spectra up to
quadratic order. The emulation of basis spectra realizes 1% level accuracy,
covering wavelength $ k \leq 1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ and redshift $0\leq z\leq 3$
up to quadratic order field. To validate the emulator, we perform the joint
fitting of the halo auto power spectrum and the halo-matter cross power
spectrum from 46 independent simulations. Depending on the choice of
counterpart, the joint fitting is unbiased up to $k_{\rm max}\simeq 0.7\,{\rm
Mpc}^{-1}h$ with $1\sim 2$ percent accuracy, for all the redshift and halo mass
samples. As one of the CSST cosmological emulator series, our emulator is
expected to provide accurate theoretical predictions of the galaxy power

their discovery in 1982, and efforts to identify distinct characteristics of
OHM host galaxies have remained inconclusive. As radio astronomy advances with
next-generation telescopes and extensive 21 cm HI surveys, precursors to the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are expected to detect the 18 cm OH masing line
with significantly increased frequency, potentially expanding the known OHM
population tenfold. These detections, however, risk confusion with
lower-redshift HI emitters unless accompanied by independent spectroscopic

for distinguishing these interloping OHMs via near- to mid-IR photometry and
emission line frequencies, we apply these techniques to data from the Arecibo
Legacy Fast ALFA [Arecibo L-band Feed Array] (ALFALFA) survey and a preliminary
APERture Tile In Focus (Apertif) HI emission line catalog from the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope. Our study, utilizing the Apache Point Observatory
3.5m telescope to obtain optical spectroscopic redshifts of 142 candidates (107
from ALFALFA and 35 from Apertif), confirms five new OHM host galaxies and
reidentifies two previously catalogued OHMs misclassified as HI emitters in
ALFALFA. These findings support the predictions from Roberts et al.

  temperatures</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Kevin M. Hickson, Jean-Christophe Loison, Valentine Wakelam</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Reactions involving atomic carbon in its ground electronic state, C(3P), play
an important role in astrochemistry due to high C-atom abundance levels. Here
we performed a kinetic investigation of the reaction between C(3P) and
acetaldehyde, CH3CHO, determining rate constants for this process over the
50-296 K range. Measurements of the formation of atomic hydrogen, H(2S), were
also performed to provide insight into product formation. Experiments were
conducted using a supersonic flow reactor coupled with pulsed laser photolysis
for C-atom generation and pulsed laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum
ultraviolet range for the detection of both C(3P) and H(2S) atoms. Quantum
chemical calculations of the ground triplet state potential energy surface of
C3H4O were also performed to provide theoretical support for the measurements.
The rate constants were large and temperature independent with an average value
of 4.0 x 10-10 cm3 s-1. This result is consistent with the theoretical results
which predict either very low barriers or none at all on the underlying
potential energy surface. Although experimental difficulties prevented the
quantitative determination of H-atom formation, qualitatively, H-atom yields
were very low with CH3CH/C2H4 + CO as the major products based on the
calculations. The influence of this reaction on interstellar chemistry was
tested using a gas-grain model of dense interstellar clouds. These simulations
predict that the C(3P) + CH3CHO reaction decreases gas-phase CH3CHO abundances
by more than an order of magnitude at early and intermediate cloud ages, with a
lower influence at typical dense cloud ages.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05189v1" target="_blank"><h2>H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet

Black, Ilane Schroetter, Olivier Berné</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in the
irradiated disk d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises the question of
whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered
star-forming regions, or if alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation
and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region
(PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and
the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV)
radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that
lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state
dynamical calculations of reactions H2 + HOC+ -> H3+ + CO and H2 + H+ -> H2+ +
H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited
H2(v>=4), a process that has not previously been included in disk models. We
find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR
of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization.
The predicted H3+ abundance peaks at x(H3+)~10^-8, coinciding with regions
where HOC+ is also abundant. The high abundances of H3+ and HOC+ are ultimately
linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0), the presence of C+, and
an enhanced reservoir of hot H2O. The predicted H3+ column densities (~10^13
cm^-2) are consistent with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of irradiated disks.
We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between
excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+. We expect this
photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G0 > 10^3. The H3+ formation
pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the
host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05469v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DECam Field of Streams: a deep view of the Milky Way halo</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Peter Ferguson, Nora Shipp</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Plotting code and minimal dataset available atthis https URL</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a Field of Streams visualizing stellar structures in the Milky Way

Accepted for publication in PASA</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We report the radio continuum detection of well known Galactic Planetary
Nebula (PN) NGC 5189, observed at 943 MHz during the Australian Square
Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU)
survey. Two detections of NGC 5189 have been made during the survey, of better
resolution than previous radio surveys. Both measurements of the integrated
flux density are consistent with each other, at $S_{\rm 943\,MHz} =
0.33\pm0.03$ Jy, and the spectral luminosity is $L_{\rm{943\,MHz}}$ = 8.89
$\times$ 10$^{13}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$. Using available flux density
measurements for radio-detections of NGC 5189, we calculate a radio surface
brightness at 1 GHz and measure $\Sigma_{\rm 1~GHz}$ = 6.0 $\times$ 10$^{-21}$
W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$, which is in the expected range for Galactic
PNe. We measure an apparent size of 3.4${'}$ $\times$ 2.2${'}$ corresponding to
physical diameters of 1.48 pc $\times$ 0.96 pc, and combine available radio
observations of NGC 5189 to estimate a spectral index of $\alpha$ = 0.12 $\pm$
0.05. Hence, we agree with previous findings that NGC 5189 is a thermal
(free-free) emitting nebula. Additional measurements of the optical depth
($\tau = 0.00246$) and electron density ($N_{e} = 138~cm^{-3}$) support our
findings that NGC 5189 is optically thin at 943 MHz. Furthermore, the radio
contours from the ASKAP-EMU image have been overlaid onto a Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 image, demonstrating that the radio
morphology closely traces the optical. Notably, the contour alignment for the
innermost region highlights the two envelopes of gas previously reported to be
low-ionisation structures, which is considered a defining feature of post

strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can
substantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and
molecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec
spectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science
program. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species
using a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this
purpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of
ro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H$_3^+$
molecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10$^{-7}$ and
approximately 10$^{-8}$, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by
gas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H$_3^+$ is
usually formed through reactions of H$_2$ with H$_2^+$ originating from cosmic
ray ionization of H$_2$. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that
H$_3^+$ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated
($G_0>$10$^3$), dense ($n_{\rm H} >10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The latter is
favored as an explanation for the presence of ``hot'' H$_3^+$ ($T_{\rm
ex}\gtrsim$1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the
emission of FUV-pumped H$_2$ and other ``PDR species'', such as CH$^+$,
CH$_3^+$, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited
H$_3^+$ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and,
underscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of
planet forming disks. They also demonstrate the power of JWST pushing the limit

Davis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 6 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present DELTA (Data-Empiric Learned Tidal Alignments), a deep learning
model that isolates galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs) from weak lensing
distortions using only observational data. The model uses an Equivariant Graph
Neural Network backbone suitable for capturing information from the local
galaxy environment, in conjunction with a probabilistic orientation output.
Unlike parametric models, DELTA flexibly learns the relationship between galaxy
shapes and their local environments, without assuming an explicit IA form or
relying on simulations. When applied to mock catalogs with realistic noisy IAs
injected, it accurately reconstructs the noise-free, pure IA signal. Mapping
these alignments provides a direct visualization of IA patterns in the mock
catalogs. Combining DELTA with deep learning interpretation techniques provides
further insights into the physics driving tidal relationships between galaxies.
This new approach to understanding and controlling IAs is suitable for
application to joint photometric and spectroscopic surveys such as the

Yamamoto, Shuichiro Yokoyama</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been
extensively discussed as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos, which can
provide missing information about dark matter. We propose a multi-band
observation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical
optics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is
expected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW
source and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as
a space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a
ground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis
of multi-band detection for a source with masses $m_1 = 30 M_{\odot}, m_2 = 20
M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \times 10^{3}
M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the
ET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density
profile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS),
and Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves
parameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated
parameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and
DECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\%$ and 58 $\%$
compared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter
error is reduced by about 65 $\%$ and 70 $\%$, and the core size error by 34
$\%$ and 68 $\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the
multi-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of
the lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07774v1" target="_blank"><h2>Redshift ~2.7 is not special</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Prajwel Joseph</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A as a comment on "Kolmogorov analysis of JWST deep survey galaxies" (arXiv:2504.17208)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galikyan et al.

outlier arises from the use of a questionable redshift estimate for one
spectrum. When the outlier is removed or the redshift is corrected, the claimed

Transient (CRAFT) survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) to compare
the locations of FRBs relative to their host light distributions. Incorporating
three additional FRBs from the literature, for a total of four repeating and 33
apparently non-repeating FRBs, we determine their projected galactocentric
offsets and find a median of $ 4.2^{+5.7}_{-2.5}$ kpc ($1.0^{+1.5}_{-0.6}r_e$).
We model their host surface brightness profiles and develop synthetic spatial
distributions of their globular clusters based on host properties. We calculate
the likelihood the observed location of each FRB is consistent with the smooth
light of its host galaxy, residual (primarily spiral) substructure, or globular
cluster distributions. The majority of FRBs favor locations within the disks of
their galaxies, while only 7-13\% favor a globular cluster origin, primarily
those with galactocentric offsets $\gtrsim3r_e$. At $z<0.15$, where spiral
structure is apparent in 86\% of our sample of FRB hosts, we find $\approx
20-46\%$ of FRBs favor an association with spiral arms. Assuming FRBs derive
from magnetars, our results support multiple formation channels with the
majority of progenitors associated with massive stars and a minority formed
through dynamical channels. However, the moderate fraction of FRBs associated
with spiral structure indicates that high star formation efficiency of the
youngest and most massive stars is not a predominant driver in the production
of FRB progenitors.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04731v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraints on the Number of Primordial Black Holes Due to Interaction

in the $Z-V_Z$ phase space in the inner disk. In this study, we present new
features of the two-armed phase spiral revealed by the Gaia Data and a new
mechanism to explain such features with multiple external perturbations. By
segmenting the Gaia DR3 RVS catalog based on $J_{\phi}$ (or $R_{g}$) and
$\theta_\phi$, we confirm the existence of the clear two-armed phase spiral in
the inner disk. Moreover, we identify a different two-armed phase spiral
pattern at slightly larger radii, resembling a weak secondary branch along with
the prominent major branch. At a given radius, with the azimuthal angle
increasing, we observe a systematic transition of the two-armed phase spiral,
with the significance of one branch weakened and another branch enhanced. This
two-armed phase spiral may be due to the overlapping of distinct one-armed
phase spirals. At different radii, the perturbation times estimated from each
branch of the two-armed phase spiral are $\sim 320$ Myr and $\sim 500$ Myr,
respectively, suggesting that the Galactic disk could be impacted by double
external perturbers separated by $\sim 180$ Myr. We also performed test
particle simulations of the disk perturbed by two satellite galaxies, which
successfully generated a two-armed phase spiral similar to the observation.
Both the observation and simulation results suggest that the signature in the
$Z-V_Z$ phase space of earlier perturbations may not be completely erased by
the more recent one.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06274v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Power Spectrum Foreground Model and

against model extensions and variations. We demonstrate consistency of the
model with pre-DR6 ACT data and observations from Planck and the South Pole

and extending the model with new components and/or free parameters. In all
scenarios, the DR6 $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$ cosmological
parameters shift by less than $0.5\sigma$ relative to the baseline constraints.
Some foreground parameters shift more; we estimate their systematic
uncertainties associated with modeling choices. From our constraint on the
kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power, we obtain a conservative limit on the
duration of reionization of $\Delta z_{\rm rei} < 4.4$, assuming a reionization
midpoint consistent with optical depth measurements and a minimal low-redshift
contribution, with varying assumptions for this component leading to tighter
limits. Finally, we analyze realistic non-Gaussian, correlated microwave sky
simulations containing Galactic and extragalactic foreground fields, built
independently of the DR6 parametric foreground model. Processing these

the input cosmological parameters of the underlying cosmic microwave background

vary the starting redshift, LPT order, and non-Gaussianities ($f^{\rm

redshift as low as $z_{\rm ini}\simeq 11.5$ reproduces to $<1 \%$ the power
spectrum, bispectrum and halo mass function of a high-resolution reference
simulation. The aliasing induced by the PNG terms in the power spectrum
produces a $ \leq 3 \%$ excess small-scale power at the initial conditions,
dropping below $0.1\%$ by $z=0$. State-of-the-art initial condition generators
show a sub-percent agreement. We show that initial conditions for simulations
with PNG should be established at a lower redshift using higher-order LPT
schemes. We also show that removing the PNG aliasing signal is unnecessary for
current simulations. The methodology proposed here can accelerate the

morphology, kinematics and dynamics. Utilizing data from the DESI Legacy
Survey, we refined its fundamental parameters (age t = 12.8 +/- 0.3 Gyr,
metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.8 +/- 0.1 dex, distance modulus dm = 17.0 +/- 0.1 mag)
and constructed matched-filter template based on the combination of these
parameters to search for extra-tidal structures. However, no significant
features were detected above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold, which limits
our ability to further investigate the association between NGC 5634 and the
Sagittarius (Sgr) stream based on morphological evidence. Incorporating GAIA
data, we further examine the orbital path of NGC 5634. We found that its orbit
only briefly intersects with the Sgr stream and diverges significantly over
long-term integrations. This behavior contrasts with that of confirmed
Sgr-associated clusters, whose orbits remain closely aligned with the stream
throughout their orbital evolution. Additionally, NGC 5634 exhibits a
relatively shorter semi-major axis and smaller apocenter and pericenter
distances compared to Sgr clusters. These orbital characteristics are more
consistent with clusters associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) or
the Helmi streams. From a dynamical perspective, in the Lz-E space, NGC 5634 is
also distinctly different from Sgr clusters and aligns more closely with the
GSE and Helmi regions. Taken together, these findings do not support a strong
connection between NGC 5634 and the Sgr dSph, but instead suggest a potential
association with another progenitor system, such as GSE or Helmi stream.
Nevertheless, further evidence is needed to definitively establish its origin.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07105v1" target="_blank"><h2>Renormalized Perturbation Theory at Field-level: the LSS bootstrap in

standard $\Lambda$CDM model, focusing on optimizing precision tests in the
nonlinear regime of large-scale structure (LSS). As an illustrative case, we
study the model-independent ``bootstrap'' coefficient of the second-order
perturbation theory (PT) kernel for matter in real space, which we use as a
proxy for new physics effects in the nonlinear sector. We discuss in details
the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff dependence induced by discretizing fields on a
grid, which requires proper renormalization to eliminate grid artifacts. We
formulate a Wilsonian perturbative framework in which the evolution from a UV
theory defined at a high cutoff $\Lambda_\text{uv}$ down to lower cutoffs is
computed analytically, even beyond the validity of a derivative expansion.
Within this framework, we develop an extended version of the GridSPT code
incorporating the bootstrap parameterization and demonstrate how
cutoff-independent predictions can be achieved through the inclusion of

PT, emphasizing the importance of higher-derivative contributions for unbiased

power spectrum emulators, allowing for fast computations of the non-linear
matter power spectrum. The first emulator works on scales $k \in
[0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the
matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\Omega_m$ and
$\Omega_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$,
the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\sigma_8$, the total neutrino
mass $M_{\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. The power
spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for
intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based
on five cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$ and the
amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equilateral}$, at
redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The
emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have
investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that
the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers. Both
emulators achieve a root-mean-squared relative error of less then 5\% for all
the redshifts considered on the scales discussed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05471v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Reassessment of the Pantheon+ and DES 5YR Calibration Uncertainties:

Lemon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are crucial tools to measure the accelerating
expansion of the universe, comprising thousands of SNe across multiple
telescopes. Accurate measurements of cosmological parameters with SNe Ia
require a robust understanding and cross-calibration of the telescopes and
filters. A previous cross-calibration effort, 'Fragilistic', provided 25
photometric systems, but offered no public code or ability to add new surveys.
We provide an open-source cross-calibration solution, available at
https://github.com/bap37/Dovekie/ . Using the Pan-STARRs (PS1) and Gaia all-sky
telescopes, we characterise the measured filters from 11 photometric systems,
including CfA, PS1, Foundation, DES, CSP, SDSS, and SNLS, using published
observations of field stars. For the first time, we derive uncertainties on
effective filter transmissions and modify filters to match the data. With the
addition of direct observations of DA white dwarfs (Boyd et al. 2025), we
simultaneously cross-calibrate our zeropoints across photometric systems and
propagate to cosmology. With improved uncertainties from DA WDs, we find
improvements to the calibration systematic uncertainty of x1.5 for the
Pantheon+ (Brout et al. 2022) sample with a new systematic photometric
uncertainty = 0.016 for FlatwCDM, and modest improvements to that of the DES5YR
analysis. We find good agreement with previous calibration, and show that even
these small calibration changes can be amplified by up to a factor of x6 in the
inferred SN Ia distances, driven by calibration sensitivity in the
colour-luminosity relations and SALT training. Initial results indicate that
these changes cause dmu/dz = 0.025 and change the recovered value of Omega_M in
LCDM by ~0.01. These may have a potentially larger impact in w0/wa space and
inferences about evolving dark energy. We pursue this calculation in an ongoing
full re-analysis of DES.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05457v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galaxy cluster count cosmology with simulation-based inference</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M. Regamey, D. Eckert, R. Seppi, W. Hartley, K. Umetsu, S. Tam, D. Gerolymatou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The abundance and mass distribution of galaxy clusters is a sensitive probe
of cosmological parameters, through the sensitivity of the high-mass end of the
halo mass function to $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. While galaxy cluster surveys
have been used as cosmological probes for more than a decade, the accuracy of
cluster count experiments is still hampered by systematic, such as the relation
between observables and halo mass, the accuracy of the halo mass function, and
the survey selection function. Here we show that these uncertainties can be
alleviated by forward modeling the observed cluster population with
simulation-based inference. We construct a pipeline that predicts the
distribution of observables from cosmological parameters and scaling relations,
and then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the input
parameters and the measured distributions. We focus on fiducial X-ray surveys
with available flux, temperature, and redshift measurements, although the
method can be easily adapted to any available observable. We apply our method
to mock samples extracted from the UNIT1i simulation and demonstrate the
accuracy of our approach. We then study the impact of several systematic
uncertainties on the recovered cosmological parameters. We show that sample
variance and the choice of the halo mass function are subdominant sources of
uncertainty. Conversely, the absolute mass scale is the leading source of
systematic error and must be calibrated at the $<10\%$ level to recover
accurate values of $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. However, the quantity
$S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.3}$ appears to be less sensitive to the accuracy
of the mass calibration. We conclude that simulation-based inference is a
promising avenue for future cosmological studies from galaxy cluster surveys
such as eROSITA and Euclid as it allows to consider all the available
observables in a straightforward manner.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04584v1" target="_blank"><h2>The future of gravitational wave science unlocking LIGO potential:

observation of cataclysmic cosmic events, such as black hole mergers and
neutron star collisions. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) has been at the forefront of these discoveries. However, the
immense volume and complexity of gravitational wave data present significant
challenges for traditional analysis methods. This paper investigates the
growing synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and GW science,
emphasizing how AI enhances signal detection, noise reduction, and data
interpretation. It begins with an overview of GW fundamentals and the role of
machine learning in increasing detector sensitivity. Notable GW events observed
by LIGO are discussed alongside persistent analytical challenges such as data
quality, generalization, and computational constraints. A comprehensive
performance review of AI techniques, including supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, is presented
based on data spanning 2021 to 2024. Evaluation metrics include accuracy,
precision, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and
computational efficiency. Findings indicate that deep learning and supervised
learning outperform other approaches, particularly in enhancing TPR and
minimizing FPR. While unsupervised and reinforcement learning models offer less
precision, they demonstrate high efficiency and potential for real-time
applications. The study also explores AI integration into next-generation
detectors and waveform reconstruction techniques. Overall, the integration of
AI into GW research significantly improves the reliability and speed of event
detection, unlocking new possibilities for exploring the dynamic universe. This
paper provides a comprehensive outlook on the transformative role of AI in
shaping the future of GW astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07692v1" target="_blank"><h2>Blue Stragglers prefer peaceful environments because binaries do the
  same</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Francesco R. Ferraro, Barbara Lanzoni, Enrico Vesperini, Emanuele Dalessandro, Mario Cadelano, Cristina Pallanca, Giacomo Beccari, Domenico Nardiello, Mattia Libralato, Giampaolo Piotto</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Under referee evaluation</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are core hydrogen-burning stars routinely
observed in resolved stellar systems. According to the theory of single star
evolution they should not exist because, due to their large mass, they should
have already evolved to stellar remnants. Hence, they are suspected to be the
result of mass-enhancement processes, like mass-transfer activity in binary
systems, mergers in binary or higher order systems, or direct stellar
collisions, possibly mediated by dynamical interactions. Galactic globular
clusters (GGCs) are templates of collisional stellar systems, where frequent
gravitational interactions among stars occur on timescales shorter than their
age. Thus, in these systems the number of BSSs originated by stellar collisions
is expected to increase with the local stellar density and the collision rate.
Here we analyse a sample of more than 3000 BSSs homogeneously observed in 48
GGCs with different structures, and we find that the number of BSSs normalized
to the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the
central density, the collision rate, and the dynamical age of the parent
cluster. We also find strikingly similar trends between these environmental
properties and the cluster binary fraction, indicating that the latter
decreases in high density/high collisional regions. We finally demonstrate that
the correlations found between BSSs and the environmental parameters are
explained by an underlying dependence of the BSS specific frequency on binary
fraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS
phenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly
because of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of
both BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a
binary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06648v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering:
  merger suppression and projected constraints</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Gabriel Luis Dizon</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 4 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH)
count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate
as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in
small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for
variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change
affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein
Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended
mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with
$q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions
favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected in the
constraints derived from the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB),
as the increased merger rate does not have as much of an impact on constraints
from resolvable mergers. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH
clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than
anticipated, but only definitively through measurements of the SGWB.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06902v1" target="_blank"><h2>Separating Angular and Radial Modes with Spherical-Fourier Bessel Power
  Spectrum on All Scales and Implications for Systematics Mitigation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Robin Y. Wen, Henry S. Grasshorn Gebhardt, Chen Heinrich, Olivier Doré</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15+6 pages, 11 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys place stringent
requirements on the mitigation of observational systematics in order to achieve
their unprecedented constraining power. In this work, we investigate the
potential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in
controlling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and
radial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial
scales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to
the clustering wedge $P(k,\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to
inherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. Crucially,
the separation of angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized
in SFB space. In particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial
distributions primarily concentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the
largest radial scales. This localization behavior enables one to selectively
remove only particular angular and radial modes contaminated by systematics.
This is in contrast to standard 3D clustering analyses based on power spectrum
multipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below
a given $k_{\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D
clustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07758v1" target="_blank"><h2>Main-sequence Turnoff Stars as Probes of the Ancient Galactic Relic:

where they were born, making them ideal tracers for studying the stellar
population. We perform a detailed chemo-dynamical analysis on moderately
metal-poor ($-2.0<\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-1.0$) MSTO stars to explore the early
accretion history of the Milky Way. Our sample includes four stars observed
with high-resolution spectroscopy using CFHT/ESPaDOnS and 163 nearby MSTO stars
selected from the SAGA database with high-resolution results. Within the
action-angle spaces, we identified Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE, 35), stars born
in the Milky Way (in situ, 31), and other substructures (21). We find that both
GSE and in-situ stars present a similar Li plateau around $A(\mathrm{Li)}\sim
2.17$. GSE shows a clear $\alpha$-knee feature in Mg at
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-1.60\pm 0.06$, while the $\alpha$-elements of in-situ
stars remain nearly constant within the metallicity range. The iron-peak
elements show little difference between GSE and in-situ stars except for Zn and
Ni, which decrease in GSE at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}>-1.6$, while they remain constant
in in-situ stars. Among heavy elements, GSE shows overall enhancement in Eu,
with [Ba/Eu] increasing with the metallicity, while this ratio remains almost
constant for in-situ stars, suggesting the contribution of longer time-scale
sources to the $s$-process in GSE. Moreover, for the first time, we present the
$r$-process abundance pattern for an extremely $r$-process enhanced ($r$-II)
GSE star, which appears consistent with the solar $r$-process pattern except
for Pr. Further investigation of larger GSE samples using high-resolution
spectra is required to explore the reason for the significantly higher Pr in
the GSE r-II star.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05090v2" target="_blank"><h2>Learning Balanced Field Summaries of the Large-Scale Structure with the

Davis</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 3 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a cosmology analysis of weak lensing convergence maps using the
Neural Field Scattering Transform (NFST) to constrain cosmological parameters.
The NFST extends the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) by incorporating
trainable neural field filters while preserving rotational and translational
symmetries. This setup balances flexibility with robustness, ideal for learning
in limited training data regimes. We apply the NFST to 500 simulations from the
CosmoGrid suite, each providing a total of 1000 square degrees of noiseless
weak lensing convergence maps. We use the resulting learned field compression
to model the posterior over $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$ in a $w$CDM
cosmology. The NFST consistently outperforms the WST benchmark, achieving a 16%
increase in the average posterior probability density assigned to test data.
Further, the NFST improves direct parameter prediction precision on $\sigma_8$
by 6% and w by 11%. We also introduce a new visualization technique to
interpret the learned filters in physical space and show that the NFST adapts
its feature extraction to capture task-specific information. These results
establish the NFST as a promising tool for extracting maximal cosmological
information from the non-Gaussian information in upcoming large-scale structure
surveys, without requiring large simulated training datasets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06668v1" target="_blank"><h2>Indicator Functions: Distilling the Information from Gaussian Random
  Fields</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Andrew Repp, Ravi K. Sheth, Istvan Szapudi, Yan-Chuan Cai</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 2 figures; submitted to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> A random Gaussian density field contains a fixed amount of Fisher information
on the amplitude of its power spectrum. For a given smoothing scale, however,
that information is not evenly distributed throughout the smoothed field. We
investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing
and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism
of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information
content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a
distance separation). We find that the information peaks at moderately rare
densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells $N\sim 100$).
Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume, indicator
function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using
only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of
recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum
and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling
for effective extraction of cosmological information.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07133v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining Dark Matter Parameters in the Lambda-CDM Framework: A

early- and late-universe observations, focusing on the matter density parameter
($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) within the
$\Lambda$CDM framework. Using data from the Planck 2018 satellite mission and
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3, we compute theoretical predictions for
angular and matter power spectra via Boltzmann solvers and perform Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using the \texttt{emcee} Python package. Our key
contribution is a direct and quantitative comparison of DES and Planck
constraints, assessing their consistency using chi-squared analysis and
Gaussian tension metrics. We find a statistically significant $6.46\sigma$
tension in $\Omega_m$ and a $2.68\sigma$ tension in $\sigma_8$ between the two
datasets. These results provide fresh evidence of persistent discrepancies in
cosmological parameter estimates and suggest that simple extensions to the
$\Lambda$CDM model may be insufficient to fully reconcile early- and late-time
observations, motivating the need for more complex theoretical models or
refined treatment of systematics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06731v1" target="_blank"><h2>Echo mapping of the black hole accretion flow in NGC 7469</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Raj Prince, Juan V.

radial structure through observed time lags that should increase with
wavelength as $\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$. Our 250-day RM campaign on NGC 7469
combines sub-day cadence 7-band photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory
robotic telescopes and weekly X-ray and UVOT data from Swift. By fitting these
light curves, we measure the spectral energy distribution of the variable
accretion disc and inter-band lags of just 1.5 days across the UV to the
optical range. The disc SED is close to the expected $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$,
and the lags are consistent with $\tau\propto \lambda^{4/3}$, but three times
larger than expected. We consider several possible modifications to standard
disc assumptions. First, for a $9\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ black hole and 2
possible spins $a^\star=(0,1)$, we fit the X-ray-UV-optical SED with a compact
relativistic corona at height $H_x=(46,27)R_g$ irradiating a flat disc with
accretion rate $\dot{m}_{Edd}\sim(0.23,0.24)$ inclined to the line of sight by
$i<20^\circ$. To fit the lags as well as the SED, this model requires a low
spin $a^\star=0$ and boosts disc color temperatures by a factor $f_{col}=1.8$,
which shifts reprocessed light to shorter wavelengths. Our Bowl model with
$f_{col}=1$ neglects relativity near the black hole but fits the UV-optical
lags and SEDs using a flat disc with $\dot{m}_{Edd}<0.06$ and a steep outer rim
at $R_{out}/c\sim5-10$ days with H/R<1%. This rim occurs near the $10^3$K dust
sublimation temperature in the disc atmosphere, supporting models that invoke
dust opacity to thicken the disc and launch failed radiatively-driven dusty
outflows at the inner edge of the broad line region (BLR). Finally, the disc
lags and SEDs exhibit a significant excess in the $u$ and $r$ bands, suggesting
the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$ emission, respectively, from the BLR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05674v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning

k-essence scalar field models for late-time cosmic acceleration: one treats
dark energy with standard matter, while the other unifies dark energy and dark
matter within a single scalar field, each governed by distinct non-canonical
Lagrangians. The background dynamics are formulated via modified Friedmann and
scalar field equations, constrained by Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO data,
using Bayesian inference (NUTS in NumPyro) and a neural network-based emulator
for efficiency. Introducing a nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ improves the
robustness and interpretability of key cosmological parameters, particularly
$H_0$, $r_d$, and $\Omega_{d0}$ by absorbing residual systematics, thereby
mitigating the Hubble tension. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is computed
for both models, revealing key differences in cosmic acceleration history:
Model I yields a present value $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.589$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.559$ with
transition redshift $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.740$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.686$,
closely aligning with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, while Model II shows a stronger
present acceleration $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.893$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.819$ but with a later
transition at $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.605$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.564$, indicating a
steeper late time evolution. Based on $\chi^2$, $\chi^2_\nu$, AIC, and BIC
statics, Model II performs worse than Model I despite its conceptual appeal.
Finally, Symbolic regression (GPlearn) is performed to reconstructs
$\omega_{eff}(z)$. Our analysis shows that Model I is statistically favored
across all metrics and offers a physically consistent alternative to
$\Lambda$CDM, capable of addressing the Hubble tension.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07794v1" target="_blank"><h2>Determining the methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Orionis

frequently used as a diagnostic tool to trace the physical conditions and
chemical evolution of interstellar sources. This study investigates methanol
deuteration in the disk around V883 Ori, utilising recent laboratory
spectroscopic data for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD along with ALMA observations. The
derived column densities for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD are (5.14$\pm$0.08) $\times
$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (4.22$\pm$0.06) $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$,
respectively. The analysis demonstrates the influence of spectroscopic data on
determining molecular column density, excitation temperature, and, most
importantly, the inferred D/H ratio. The D/H ratio for CH$_2$DOH is calculated
to be (7.3$\pm$1.5) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ after applying a statistical correction,
whilst the D/H ratio for CH$_3$OD is (1.79$\pm$0.36) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$. The
discovery of an unexpectedly low CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OD ratio (1.22$\pm$0.02) in
V883 Ori, however, raises further questions about the synthesis and chemical
processes involved in CH$_3$OD formation. Overall, this study underscores the
importance of accurate spectroscopic data for studies of isotopic fractionation
and provides new insights into methanol deuteration chemistry in star-forming
regions. Future research, combining updated spectroscopy and chemical
modelling, will help further constrain these processes across different masses
and evolutionary stages.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07097v1" target="_blank"><h2>Candidate red supergiants from Gaia DR3 BPRP spectra: From the Perseus

Our position within the Galactic plane and the dust obscuration make
it challenging to retrieve a true picture of the Milky Way's morphology. While
the Milky Way has been recognized as a barred spiral galaxy since the 1960s,
there is still uncertainty about the exact number of spiral arms it contains.
Currently, our understanding of the Galaxy is evolving thanks to the
unprecedented detail provided by Gaia's parallactic distances. Aims. To shed
light on the spatial distribution of red supergiants (RSGs) on the Disk and
their uniformity of parameters across it, a census of Galactic RSGs detected by
Gaia is needed. Methods. Candidate RSGs were extracted from the combined Gaia
DR3 and 2MASS catalogs using color criteria and parallactic distances. The
sample includes 335 stars that were not included in catalogs of previously
known RSGs detected by Gaia DR3. Interstellar and circumstellar extinction
values were estimated from the infrared bands. Spectral types were collected
from Simbad or VIZIER databases and, for 135 candidates, were inferred from the
Gaia DR3 BPRP spectra. Stellar luminosities were inferred using photometric
measurements and the Gaia DR3 distances. Results. The analysis yielded a
genuine sample of O-rich late-type stars, and the calculated luminosities
confirm that the sample is mostly made of stars brighter than Mbol=-5 mag. This
new sample represents a 40% increase in the number of highly probable RSGs
compared to previous studies. When looking at the X and Y distribution on the
Galactic plane, beside the populous Perseus associations of RSGs and the
Sagittarius group of RSGs, a novel population of highly probable RSGs
populating the more distant Scutum-Centaurus arm appears.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07994v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resonant neutrino self-interactions: insights from the full shape galaxy

up to $g_\nu< 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator.
Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator
independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu < 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$
confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are
unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard
$\Lambda$CDM framework.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07786v1" target="_blank"><h2>CMB line-of-sight integrators for nearly-isotropic cosmological models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  João G. Vicente, Thiago S. Pereira, Cyril Pitrou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 8 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions
of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as
any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation
and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of
non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and
isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly
the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires
(1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2)
that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate
complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight
integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models:
\texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package,
and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann
solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could
generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes.
This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to
constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05161v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Hourglass Simulation: A Catalog for the Roman High-Latitude
  Time-Domain Core Community Survey</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  B. M. Rose, M. Vincenzi, R. Hounsell, H. Qu, L. Aldoroty, D. Scolnic, R. Kessler, P. Macias, D. Brout, M. Acevedo, R. C. Chen, S. Gomez, E. Peterson, D. Rubin, M. Sako</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a simulation of the time-domain catalog for the Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope's High-Latitude Time-Domain Core Community Survey. This
simulation, called the Hourglass simulation, uses the most up-to-date spectral
energy distribution models and rate measurements for ten extra-galactic
time-domain sources. We simulate these models through the design reference
Roman Space Telescope survey: four filters per tier, a five day cadence, over
two years, a wide tier of 19 deg$^2$ and a deep tier of 4.2 deg$^2$, with
$\sim$20% of those areas also covered with prism observations. We find that a
science-independent Roman time-domain catalog, assuming a S/N at max of >5,
would have approximately 21,000 Type Ia supernovae, 40,000 core-collapse
supernovae, around 70 superluminous supernovae, $\sim$35 tidal disruption
events, 3 kilonovae, and possibly pair-instability supernovae. In total,
Hourglass has over 64,000 transient objects, 11 million photometric
observations, and 500,000 spectra. Additionally, Hourglass is a useful data set
to train machine learning classification algorithms. We show that SCONE is able
to photometrically classify Type Ia supernovae with high precision ($\sim$95%)
to a z > 2. Finally, we present the first realistic simulations of non-Type Ia
supernovae spectral-time series data from Roman's prism.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07904v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fundamental Parameters for Central Stars of 103 Infrared Bowshock

Dale</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 17 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar bowshock nebulae are arcuate shock fronts formed by the interaction
of radiation-driven stellar winds and the relative motion of the ambient
interstellar material. Stellar bowshock nebulae provide a promising means to
measure wind-driven mass loss, independent of other established methods. In
this work, we characterize the stellar sources at the center of bowshock
nebulae drawn from all-sky catalogs of 24 $\mu$m-selected nebulae. We obtain
new, low-resolution blue optical spectra for \numstars~stars and measure
stellar parameters temperature \teff, surface gravity \logg, and projected
rotational broadening \vsini. We perform additional photometric analysis to
measure stellar radius \rstar, luminosity \lstar, and visual-band extinction
$A_V$. All but one of our targets are O and early B stars, with temperatures
ranging from $T$=16.5--46.8~k\kelvin, gravities $\log g=$2.57--4.60, and
\vsini~from $<$100--400~\kms. With the exception of rapid rotator $\zeta$ Oph,
bowshock stars do not rotate at or near critical velocities. At least 60 of 103
(60\%) OB bowshock stars are binaries, consistent with the multiplicity
fraction of other OB samples. The sample shows a runaway fraction of 23\%, with
\numrunaway~stars having $v_{\text{2D}}\geq25$~\kms. Of the 19 runaways, at
least 15 ($\geq$79\%) are binaries, favoring dynamical ejection over the binary
supernova channel for producing runaways. We provide a comprehensive census of
stellar parameters for bowshock stars, useful as a foundation for determining
the mass-loss rates for OB-type stars -- one of the single most critical
factors in stellar evolution governing the production of neutron stars and
black holes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04778v1" target="_blank"><h2>Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion by the Nuclear Star Cluster:
  the Case of M31*</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Zhao Su, Zhiyuan Li, Zongnan Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 15 pages, 5 figures. Accepted by ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as
M31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an
extremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\sim10^8~\rm~M_\odot$).
In this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a
previously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar
mass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous
eccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss
is assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic
giant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31*
and together provide a mass injection rate of
$\sim4\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady
state on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool
($T\sim10^3-10^4~\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established.
This disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the
central SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of
$\sim2\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of
few depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate
global inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\sim10^{36}~\rm
erg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\sim10^7-10^8~\rm K$) plasma within 0.2
parsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude
that the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has
important implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local
universe.</p></br></body>
