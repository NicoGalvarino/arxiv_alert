  galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Rubens E. G. Machado, Caroline F. O. Grinberg, Elvis A. Mello-Terencio</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Galaxies</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Galaxies moving through the gas of the intracluster medium (ICM) experience
ram pressure stripping, which can leave behind a gas tail. When a disk galaxy
receives the wind edge-on, however, the characteristic signature is not a
typical jellyfish tail, but rather an unwinding of the spiral arms. We aim to
quantify such asymmetries both in the gas and in the stellar component of a
simulated galaxy. To this end, we simulate a gas-rich star-forming spiral
galaxy moving through a self-consistent ICM gas. The amplitude and location of
the asymmetries were measured via Fourier decomposition. We found that the
asymmetry is much more evident in the gas component, but it is also measurable
in the stars. The amplitude tends to increase with time and the asymmetry
radius migrates inwards. We found that, when considering the gas, the spiral
arms extend much further and are more unwound than the corresponding stellar
arms. Characterizing the unwinding via simulations should help inform the
observational criteria used to classify ram pressure stripped galaxies, as
opposed to asymmetries induced by other mechanisms.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02326v1" target="_blank"><h2>Hadronic origin of the very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the

(VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active
galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE
gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive
molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray
protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the
supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce
gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra
and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if
the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion
coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way
interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos
co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with
IceCube-Gen2.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02527v1" target="_blank"><h2>A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE).
  XIX. The discovery of a spectacular 230 kpc Halpha tail following NGC 4569 in

Vollmer</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, submitted to A&A</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context. Galaxies fly inside galaxy clusters and ram pressure by the ICM can
remove a large amount of the ISM from the galaxy, and deposit the gas in the
ICM. The ISM decoupled from the host galaxy leaves a long trail following the
moving galaxy. Such long trails track the galaxy motion and can be detected
with sensitive data in Halpha.
  Aims. We study the Halpha tail trailing NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster.
  Methods. The initial discovery was made with the deep Halpha imaging data
with CFHT, from the VESTIGE project. The follow-up spectroscopic observations
were made with APO/DIS, MMT/Binospec and CFHT/SITELLE.
  Results. Besides the known 80 kpc Halpha tail downstream of NGC 4569, the
deep Halpha imaging data allow the Halpha tail detected to at least 230 kpc
from the galaxy. More importantly, the Halpha clumps implied from the imaging
data are confirmed with the spectroscopic data. The Halpha clumps show a smooth
radial velocity gradient across about 1300 km/s, eventually reaching the
velocity of the cluster. We build a simple model to explain the deceleration of
stripped clumps and constrain the age to about 0.9 Gyr.
  Conclusions. This discovery, for the first time, demonstrates the full
deceleration process of the stripped ISM. This discovery also showcases the
potential with wide-field Halpha survey on galaxy clusters to discover
intracluster optical emission-line clouds originated from cluster galaxies.
These clouds provide kinematic tracers to the infall history of cluster
galaxies and the turbulence in the ICM. They are also excellent multi-phase
objects to study the relevant important physical processes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02384v1" target="_blank"><h2>The SOMA-POL Survey. I. Polarization and magnetic field properties of

Tan, Kate Pattle, Zacariyya Khan</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to A&A, comments welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (abstract), AGN (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The role of magnetic fields in regulating the formation of massive stars
remains much debated. Here we present sub-millimeter polarimetric observations
with JCMT-POL2 at $850\:\mu$m of 13 regions of massive star formation selected
from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) star formation survey, yielding a total of 29
massive protostars. Our investigation of the $p'-I$ relationship suggests that
grain alignment persists up to the highest intensities. We examine the relative
orientations between polarization-inferred magnetic field direction and source
column density elongation direction on small and large scales. On small scales,
we find a bimodal distribution of these relative orientations, i.e., with an
excess of near-parallel and near-perpendicular orientations. By applying a
one-sample Kuiper test and Monte Carlo simulations to compare to a relative
orientation distribution drawn from a uniform distribution, we statistically
confirm this bimodal distribution, independent of the methods to measure
structural orientation. This bimodal distribution suggests that magnetic fields
are dynamically important on the local scales ($\lesssim 0.6\:$pc) of massive
protostellar cores. We also examine how basic polarization properties of
overall degree of polarization and local dispersion in polarization vector
orientations depend on intrinsic protostellar properties inferred from spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling. We find a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the debiased polarized fraction and the luminosity to
mass ratio, $L_{\rm bol}/M_{\rm env}$, which hints at a change in the dust
properties for protostellar objects at different evolutionary stages.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02651v1" target="_blank"><h2>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes
  with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Meng-Lin Zhao, Yue Shao, Sai Wang, Xin Zhang</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 26 pages, 11 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), IGM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in
modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen
during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during
this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking
radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and
ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the
21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as
a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we
systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array
(SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum.
Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach
sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm
s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM
particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and
abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA
could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation
that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits.
Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to
probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which
are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the
SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles
and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02490v1" target="_blank"><h2>Primordial black hole formation in k-inflation models</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Neven Bilić, Dragoljub D.

(MOND) phenomenology for dark matter at galactic scales rely on ad hoc free
functions, preventing them from being regarded as fundamental. In this work, we
present a new theory that reproduces MOND, built on a supposed to be
fundamental Yang-Mills gauge field based on SU(2), with a gravitational
coupling constant, and emerging in a low-acceleration regime, below the MOND
acceleration scale. The gauge field plays the role of the internal force in the
dipolar dark matter (DDM) model. We discuss how certain solutions of this
theory recover the deep MOND regime without introducing arbitrary functions in
the action. Within this framework, the MOND phenomenology appears to be due to
the existence of a new sector of particle physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02685v1" target="_blank"><h2>Axion USR Inflation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alireza Talebian, Hassan Firouzjahi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 30 pages, 12 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), LLS (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We consider a model of inflation in which the inflaton field is a rolling
axion with a potential which is flat enough to support an intermediate phase of
USR inflation. Because of the Chern-Simons interaction, one polarization of the
gauge field experiences the tachyonic growth during the first slow-roll stage,
inducing large corrections in curvature perturbations via the inverse decay
effect. A non-trivial feature of our setup is that once the system enters the
USR phase, the instability parameter falls off rapidly, terminating the gauge
field production efficiently. Consequently, the power spectrum involves two
separate peaks, the first peak is induced by the gauge field particles
production while the second peak is due to standard USR mechanism. We show that
the power spectrum at the intermediate scales develops strong scale-dependence
$\propto k^m$ with the index $m >4$. Calculating the bispectrum, we demonstrate
that non-Gaussianities with non-trivial shapes and multiple peaks are generated
in this setup.</p></br></body>
