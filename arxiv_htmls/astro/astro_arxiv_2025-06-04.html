The evolving relationship between galaxies and the
  intergalactic medium in the final stages of reionization</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Daichi Kashino, Simon J. Lilly, Jorryt Matthee, Ruari Mackenzie, Anna-Christina Eilers, Rongmon Bordoloi, Robert A. Simcoe, Rohan P. Naidu, Minghao Yue, Bin Liu</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and
the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization,
based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam $3.5\,\mathrm{\mu
m}$ slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948
[\OIII]$\lambda5008$-emitting galaxies with $-21.4\lesssim
M_\mathrm{UV}\lesssim -17.2$ spanning $5.33<z<6.97$ along six quasar
sightlines. We correlate these galaxies with \Lya\ and \Lyb\ transmission
measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift
intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy
density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at $z<5.50$,
while enhanced at $5.70<z<6.15$. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional
behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption
within $\sim 8$\,cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission
at intermediate scales ($\sim$5--20\,cMpc) at $z>5.70$. Statistical tests using
mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the
transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise
by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in
overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation
fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates
ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes
increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies.
These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized
regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually
extending into underdense regions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03015v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias

We welcome comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the
impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star
formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity
mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are
flux-weighted, and for many emission lines (e.g., H$\alpha$), flux scales with
SFR. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the
power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the
scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates
with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. In IllustrisTNG,
this secondary bias increases the two-halo term by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$
compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and
satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- sensitive to
intra-halo SFR distribution -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To
mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration
(for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h
\gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the
need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and
interpreting LIM observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01620v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the potential for kinematically colder HI component as a
  tracer for star-forming gas in nearby galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Hye-Jin Park, Andrew J. Battisti, Antoine Marchal, Luca Cortese, Emily Wisnioski, Mark Seibert, Shin-Jeong Kim, Naomi McClure-Griffiths, W. J. G. de Blok, Kathryn Grasha, Barry F. Madore, Jeff A. Rich, Rachael L. Beaton</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication to MNRAS</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Atomic hydrogen (HI) dominates the mass of the cold interstellar medium,
undergoing thermal condensation to form molecular gas and fuel star formation.
Kinematically colder HI components, identified via kinematic decomposition of
HI 21 cm data cubes, serve as a crucial transition phase between diffuse warm
neutral gas and molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$). We analyse these colder HI
components by decomposing HI 21 cm data cubes of seven nearby galaxies -
Sextans A, NGC 6822, WLM, NGC 5068, NGC 7793, NGC 1566, and NGC 5236 - spanning
metallicities (0.1 < $Z/Z_{\odot}$ < 1.0) and physical scales (53-1134 pc).
Using a velocity dispersion threshold of 6 km s$^{-1}$, we classify the
kinematically distinct components into narrow (colder) and broad (warmer).
Cross-correlation analysis between the narrow HI components and H$_{2}$ or star
formation rate (SFR) surface density at different spatial scales reveals that
dwarf galaxies exhibit the strongest correlation at ~500-700 pc. The radially
binned narrow HI fraction, $f_{\rm n} = I_{\rm narrowHI}/I_{\rm totalHI}$, in
dwarf galaxies shows no clear trend with metallicity or SFR, while in spirals,
$f_{\rm n}$ is lower in inner regions with higher metallicity and SFR. We find
that the dataset resolution significantly impacts the results, with higher
physical resolution data yielding a higher median $f_{\rm n}$, $\langle f_{\rm
n} \rangle$, per galaxy. With this considered, dwarf galaxies consistently
exhibit a larger $f_{\rm n}$ than spiral galaxies. These findings highlight the
critical role of cold HI in regulating star formation across different galactic
environments and emphasise the need for high-resolution HI observations to
further unravel the connection between atomic-to-molecular gas conversion and
galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02848v1" target="_blank"><h2>Active galactic nuclei through the prism of galaxy clusters: bounds on
  axion-like particles</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Denys Malyshev, Lidiia Zadorozhna, Yuriy Bidasyuk, Andrea Santangelo, Oleg Ruchayskiy</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their
potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered
fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons
traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both
the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral
absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.
  Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features
in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of
cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new
approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic
field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in
magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of
photon-to-ALP conversion.
  With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP
parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will
significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using
different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The
Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe
the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02104v1" target="_blank"><h2>Collisionless relaxation to quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark
  matter halos: origin of the universal NFW profile</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Uddipan Banik, Amitava Bhattacharjee</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, physics.plasm-ph</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 4 figures; submitted to Physical Review D. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:2411.18827</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are
known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear
physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The
origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly
because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To
solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear
theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous,
self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations.
We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution
of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in
the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only
depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of
the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive
heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density
profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent
accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$
fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a
quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not
particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the
halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We
demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an
attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03023v1" target="_blank"><h2>TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Simon Birrer, Elizabeth J.

(hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis
incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra
obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and
the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated
JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics
from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of
non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI
resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S)
sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface
brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected
for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally
conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors'
mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias.
Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with
$\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN)
dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find
$H_0=72.1^{+4.0}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are
in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on
$H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5
dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO)
likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present
constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM
cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all
presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree
with those from the BAO and SN.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02641v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observations of non complex organic molecules in the gas phase of the
  interstellar medium</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Charlotte Vastel, Francesco Fontani</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted in Elsevier Handbook of Astrochemistry (2025)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The field of astrochemistry has seen major advances triggered by the
completion of new powerful radio telescopes, with gains in sensitivity of
receivers and in bandwidth. To date, about 330 molecular species are detected,
in interstellar clouds, circumstellar shells and even extragalactic sources.
The first interstellar molecules were first discovered through their electronic
transitions in the visual and near UV regions of the spectra in the 1930s. Then
the discovery of (pure) rotational transitions of interstellar molecules dates
back to the late 1960s. The improvement of detectors and the increase in
telescope sizes really opened up the submillimeter sky. The radio and
submillimeter ranges cover the lowest rotational lines of molecular species.
The bigger the molecule, the more spectral lines at different frequencies it
produces, with weaker line intensities. Over the past 30 years, we have
discovered that we live in a molecular universe, where molecules are abundant
and widespread, probing the structure and evolution of galaxies, as well as the
temperature and density of the observed medium, opening a new field called
astrochemistry. The progress has been dramatic, since the discovery of the
first molecules about 100 years ago. We present in this review, the detection
techniques that led to the discovery of the simple molecules in the gas phase
and the methodology that lead to the abundances determinations and the
comparison with chemical modelling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02937v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in

(SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense
regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals
(EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH,
emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW)
observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals,
including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band
for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark
matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its
effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW
spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead
to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies
and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for
dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02799v1" target="_blank"><h2>Distance to the Galactic centre 7$^\prime$ halo from HI absorption</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Debangan Maji, Subhashis Roy</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Accepted for publication in ApJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Using archival data, we have made an HI absorption study of the 7$^\prime$
halo surrounding the Sgr A complex, observed towards the Galactic centre (GC)
region. We find strong HI absorption near velocities of $-$53 km s$^{-1}$,
which is due to the 3-kpc arm, placing it beyond 5 kpc from us. We further
examined the HI absorption properties towards 5 different parts of the
7$^\prime$ halo. Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3
parts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO
and CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the
+50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\prime$ halo is
partly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our
knowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\prime$ halo to be
located at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at
the GC region.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03130v1" target="_blank"><h2>AGNBoost: A Machine Learning Approach to AGN Identification with

Bagley, Mark Dickinson, Steven L. Finkelstein, Nor Pirzkal</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to
identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry.
AGNBoost constructs 121 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands-including
magnitudes, colors, and squared color terms-to simultaneously predict the
fraction of mid-IR $3-30\,\mu$m emission attributable to an AGN power law
(frac$_\text{AGN}$) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on a sample
of $10^6$ simulated galaxies from CIGALE providing ground truth values of both
frac$_\text{AGN}$ and redshift. Models are tested against both mock CIGALE
galaxies set aside for testing and 698 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS
Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On mock galaxies, AGNBoost achieves $15\%$
outlier fractions of $0.19\%$ (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and $0.63\%$ (redshift), with
a root mean square error ($\sigma_\text{RMSE}$) of $0.027$ for
frac$_\text{AGN}$ and a normalized mean absolute deviation
($\sigma_\text{NMAD}$) of 0.011 for redshift. On MEGA galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves $\sigma_\text{NMAD}$ = 0.074 and
$17.05\%$ outliers, with most outliers at $z_\text{spec} > 2$. AGNBoost
frac$_\text{AGN}$ estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting
($\sigma_\text{RMSE} = 0.183$, $20.41\%$ outliers), and AGNBoost finds a
similar number of AGNs as CIGALE SED fitting. The flexible framework of
AGNBoost allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands
and derived qualities, and simple re-training for other variables of interest.
AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys
requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02099v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Stellar Populations and Rest-Frame Colors of Star-Forming Galaxies

the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, at $z > 6$) suffers from degeneracies among the
apparent properties of the stars, the nebular gas, and the dust. These
degeneracies are most prominent with photometry, which has insufficient (1)
spectral resolution and (2) rest-frame spectral coverage. We explore ways to
break these degeneracies with a sample of $N = 22$ high-redshift star-forming
galaxies at $7 < z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 9$, using some of the deepest existing
imaging from JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI with JADES. Key to this study is the
imaging from JWST/MIRI at $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$, which provides coverage of the
rest-frame $I$-band at the observed redshifts. We infer stellar population
properties and rest-frame colors using a variety of filter sets and star
formation history assumptions to explore the impact of these choices.
Evaluating these quantities both with and without the $7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ data
point shows that dense spectral coverage with JWST/NIRCam (eight or more
filters, including at least one medium-band) can compensate for lacking the
rest-frame $I$-band coverage for the vast majority ($\approx 80\%$) of our
sample. Furthermore, these galaxy properties are most consistently determined
by assuming the delayed-tau star formation history, which provides the smallest
offsets and scatters around these offsets when including JWST/MIRI. Within
extragalactic surveys like JADES and CEERS, our findings suggest that robust
characterization of the stellar population properties and rest-frame colors for
high-redshift star-forming galaxies is possible with JWST/NIRCam alone at $z
\approx 8$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01431v1" target="_blank"><h2>Binding energies of small interstellar molecules on neutral and charged

The Version of Record is available online at DOI:https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/add145</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The interstellar medium (ISM) is all but empty. To date, more than 300
molecules have already been discovered. Because of the extremely low
temperature, the gas-phase chemistry is dominated by barrierless exothermic
reactions of radicals and ions. However, several abundant molecules and organic
molecules cannot be produced efficiently by gas-phase reactions. To explain the
existence of such molecules in the ISM, gas-surface interactions between small
molecules and dust particles covered with amorphous solid water (ASW) mantles
must be considered. In general, surface processes such as adsorption,
diffusion, desorption, and chemical reactions can be linked to the binding
energy of molecules to the surface. Hence, a lot of studies have been performed
to identify the binding energies of interstellar molecules on ASW surfaces.
Cosmic radiation and free electrons may induce a negative charge on the dust
particles, and the binding energies may be affected by this charge. In this
study, we calculate the binding energies of CO, CH4, and NH3, on neutral and
charged ASW surfaces using DFT calculations. Our results indicate that CO can
interact with the surface charge, increasing its binding energy. In contrast,
the binding energy of CH4 remains unchanged in the presence of surface charge,
and that of NH3 typically decreases.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02173v1" target="_blank"><h2>Turbulent drag on stellar mass black holes embedded in AGN discs</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Alessandro Alberto Trani, Pierfrancesco Di Cintio</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 5 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate how AGN disk turbulence affects the orbital dynamics of a
stellar-mass black hole (BH) initially located at a migration trap, focusing on
the long-term behavior of eccentricity and inclination in the quasi-embedded
regime. We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled
as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We
integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian
coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach,
and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and
inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances
determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate
to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the
numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in
both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable
to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial
conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full
circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence
of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary
formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and
inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced
stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in
AGN environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02745v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- The surface brightness and colour

Observations provides a unique opportunity to study cluster environment ranging
from outskirts to dense regions. Leveraging unprecedented optical and
near-infrared depths, we investigate the stellar structure of massive disc
galaxies in this field. This study focuses on outer disc profiles, including
simple exponential (Type I), down- (Type II) and up-bending break (Type III)
profiles, and their associated colour gradients, to trace late assembly
processes across various environments. Type II profiles, though relatively rare
in high dense environments, appear stabilised by internal mechanisms like bars
and resonances, even within dense cluster cores. Simulations suggest that in
dense environments, Type II profiles tend to evolve into Type I profiles over
time. Type III profiles often exhibit small colour gradients beyond the break,
hinting at older stellar populations, potentially due to radial migration or
accretion events. We analyse correlations between galaxy mass, morphology, and
profile types. Mass distributions show weak trends of decreasing mass from the
centre to the outskirts of the Perseus cluster. Type III profiles become more
prevalent, while Type I profiles decrease in lower-mass galaxies with cluster
centric distance. Type I profiles dominate in spiral galaxies, while Type III
profiles are more common in S0 galaxies. Type II profiles are consistently
observed across all morphological types. While the limited sample size
restricts statistical power, our findings shed light on the mechanisms shaping
galaxy profiles in cluster environments. Future work should extend observations
to the cluster outskirts to enhance statistical significance. Additionally, 3D
velocity maps are needed to achieve a non-projected view of galaxy positions,
offering deeper insights into spatial distribution and dynamics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01282v1" target="_blank"><h2>Shape Shifting Light Dark Matter Solitons</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Dor Ben-Amotz</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 17 pages, 4 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dark matter consisting of a Bose-Einstein-Condensate (BEC) of ultra-light
particles is predicted to have a soliton shape that shifts with the dark matter
mass fraction in galaxies with a centrally localized stellar mass (such as a
black hole). In the self-gravitating dark matter limit, the predicted cored
soliton shape is consistent with previous numerical predictions and analytical
approximations. As the dark matter mass fraction decreases, the soliton is
predicted to become increasingly cusp shaped, asymptotically approaching an
exponential density distribution (isomorphic with a Hydrogen 1s state), with a
central slope comparable to that predicted by cold dark matter simulations. The
soliton shapes are obtained by solving the associated Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson
equation with the ground state wavefunction represented as a sum of Gaussians
with numerically optimized amplitudes and widths. The results are used to
express the soliton size, total mass and density directly in terms of the
corresponding velocity dispersion, by invoking an approximation relating tracer
star rotational velocity and dispersion that is validated by experimental
observations. Applications of the predictions, as well as challenges associated
with critically testing dark matter models, are illustrated using comparisons
with dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy observations.
Implications include speculations regarding the possible role of dark matter
evaporation in galactic evolution, as well as a light-dark-matter hypothesis
that dark matter solitons may be photon condensates, if photons have a non-zero
rest mass consistent with the upper bounds established by a wide range of
optical and electrodynamic measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01459v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Effect of Measurement Uncertainties on the Inferred Stability of
  Planes of Satellite Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Prem Kumar, Marcel S. Pawlowski, Kosuke Jamie Kanehisa, Pengfei Li, Mariana P. Júlio, Salvatore Taibi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages for main body</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Observations have revealed that the MW, Andromeda, Centaurus A (and
potentially other galaxies) host spatially thin and kinematically coherent
planes of satellites. Such structures are highly improbable within the standard
LCDM cosmological model, and the dynamical stability of these planes has been a
subject of debate for a long time. Accurately determining their stability
requires a thorough understanding of orbital parameters such as proper motion,
distance, and line-of-sight velocity, in addition to the gravitational
potential of the host galaxy. However, many of these remain insufficiently
constrained, leading to significant uncertainties in any analysis. This
research aims to explore the impact of measurement errors in proper motions and
distances of the satellite galaxies and in the adopted host halo mass on the
inferred stability of satellite planes in Milky-Way-like potentials. Test
satellite galaxies orbiting a host galaxy are simulated, mock observed by
adding various degrees and types of observational errors, and then
backward-integrated. Trends and correlations between the initial conditions and
the applied uncertainties on the inferred orbital stability of the satellite
systems are analyzed. Additionally, the effects of adopting incorrect
potentials and the impact of different orbital eccentricities are considered.
Uncertainties in proper motions lead to an inferred, ostensible widening of an
intrinsically stable satellite plane, with its width increasing linearly with
the adopted proper motion uncertainties. Even uncertainties on the level of
Gaia systematics strongly affect the plane's inferred past width. Moreover, the
potential with a low halo mass showed a significant impact on the stability of
these planes, while the remaining two host models showed similar effects.
Uncertainties in satellite distance also contribute noticeably to the inferred,
apparent instability.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01564v1" target="_blank"><h2>Interstellar Polarization Survey. V. Galactic magnetic field tomography

Kawabata</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 27 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in AJ</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Interstellar linear polarization occurs when starlight passes through
elongated dust grains aligned by interstellar magnetic fields. The observed
polarization can come from different dust structures along the line of sight
(LOS). By combining polarization measurements with stellar distances, we can
study the plane-of-sky Galactic magnetic field (GMF) between the observer and
the star and separate the contributions of clouds with different GMF
properties. We used optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarization data from
three regions in the Galactic plane ($|b|<1^{\circ}$ and
$19.\!\!^{\circ}8<l<25.\!\!^{\circ}5$) to perform a polarization decomposition
across the Galactic arms. A comparison between optical and NIR data showed an
optical-to-NIR polarization ratio of 2 to 3 along the LOS and a consistent
polarization angle across both wavelengths in all studied regions, within
measurement uncertainties. We applied the Bayesian Inference of Starlight
Polarization in one dimension and the Gaussian Mixture Model methods to
decompose the polarization in the three regions. Optical and NIR observations
complemented each other, consistently identifying nearby ($d\lesssim143$ pc),
intermediate ($0.47$ kpc $< d < 1.2$ kpc), and distant ($1.5$ kpc $< d < 2.5$
kpc) polarizing clouds, in agreement with previous findings in the Local Bubble
wall, the Local arm, and the Sagittarius arm dust structures. The results from
both polarization decomposition methods agree and complement each other.
Polarization tomography revealed significant LOS variations in the plane-of-sky
magnetic field orientation in two of the three regions. The relative alignment
between the magnetic fields traced by starlight polarization and Planck's
polarized thermal dust emission at 353 GHz reaffirmed these variations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03008v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid preparation. Constraining parameterised models of modifications

Vielzeuf</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 21 pages, 9 figures</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Euclid mission has the potential to understand the fundamental physical
nature of late-time cosmic acceleration and, as such, of deviations from the
standard cosmological model, LCDM. In this paper, we focus on model-independent
methods to modify the evolution of scalar perturbations at linear scales. We
consider two approaches: the first is based on the two phenomenological
modified gravity (PMG) parameters, $\mu_{\rm mg}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm mg}$, which
are phenomenologically connected to the clustering of matter and weak lensing,
respectively; and the second is the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy
and modified gravity, which we use to parameterise the braiding function,
$\alpha_{\rm B}$, which defines the mixing between the metric and the dark
energy field. We discuss the predictions from spectroscopic and photometric
primary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and a given set of
additional parameters featuring the PMG and EFT models. We use the Fisher
matrix method applied to spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), weak lensing
(WL), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), and cross-correlation (XC) between
GCph and WL. For the modelling of photometric predictions on nonlinear scales,
we use the halo model to cover two limits for the screening mechanism: the
unscreened (US) case, for which the screening mechanism is not present; and the
super-screened (SS) case, which assumes strong screening. We also assume scale
cuts to account for our uncertainties in the modelling of nonlinear
perturbation evolution. We choose a time-dependent form for $\{\mu_{\rm
mg},\Sigma_{\rm mg}\}$, with two fiducial sets of values for the corresponding
model parameters at the present time, $\{\bar{\mu}_0,\bar{\Sigma}_0\}$, and two
forms for $\alpha_{\rm B}$, with one fiducial set of values for each of the
model parameters, $\alpha_{\rm B,0}$ and $\{\alpha_{\rm B,0},m\}$. (Abridged)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02124v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Relationship Between Eddington Ratio and Column Density in U/LIRG

the AGN's own radiation, marked by changes in their obscuration and Eddington
ratio during accretion events. Because AGN in infrared-selected galaxies are
more likely to be Compton-thick and have evidence for over-massive black holes,
we explore whether infrared-selected AGN follow the radiation-regulated AGN
growth scheme. We calculate the Eddington ratios of nine U/LIRG AGN with
dynamical BH mass measurements, finding that though the number of objects is
limited, AGN in IR-selected galaxies appear consistent with radiation
pressure-regulated growth. We suggest that enlarging the sample of dynamical BH
mass measurements in IR-selected systems will provide more stringent tests of
whether their AGN are primarily regulated by radiation pressure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01390v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dense clumps survive in the vicinity of R136 in 30 Doradus</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  M.

Herrera</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 23 pages, 19 figures, 14 tables. Accepted to A&A</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor)
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding
molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in
projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts
the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the
properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why
these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama
Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of
continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers
CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the
nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical
properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared
the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC.
Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and
HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust
lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun,
and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses
obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of
the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas.
Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers
($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young
stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are
consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the
densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.</p></br></body>
