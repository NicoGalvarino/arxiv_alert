  Galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Tingfang Su, Suoqing Ji, Feng Yuan, Haojie Xia, Yuxuan Zou</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to APJ</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> galaxy evolution (abstract), outflows (abstract), outflow (abstract), ISM (abstract), feedback (title, abstract), AGN (title, abstract), AGN feedback (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in dwarf galaxies remains
poorly understood, with conventional wisdom suggesting it primarily suppresses
star formation. Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve
the Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance
rather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our
simulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by
approximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova
feedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through
AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling
preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy,
creating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism
operates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate
AGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy.
Critically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert:
without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too
powerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match
observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar
shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These
findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that
AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation
during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21709v1" target="_blank"><h2>From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth,
  mergers, and tidal disruptions</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Konstantinos Kritos, Joseph Silk</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, gr-qc</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 19 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are
hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole,
possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and
likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear
star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the
supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black
hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our
model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under
reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption
events and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal
disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture
rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we
comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21263v1" target="_blank"><h2>The relation between the optical variability timescale, magnetic field
  of jets and black hole spin in active galactic nuclei</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yongyun Chen, Qiusheng Gu, Junhui Fan, Dingrong Xiong, Xiaoling Yu, Xiaotong Guo, Nan Ding, Ting-Feng Yi</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 4 figures, accept for publication in the Astrophysical Journal</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole
spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in
jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW)
model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability
timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black
hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our
analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field
($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability
timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical
variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black
hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with
the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the
characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm
DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant
correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass,
expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm
\odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this
relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black
hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational
instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the
light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21197v1" target="_blank"><h2>Supernovae Driven Winds Impede Lyman Continuum Escape from Dwarf

enough ionizing (Lyman continuum; LyC) photons to reionize the Universe. Yet,
the efficiency of LyC escape and the roles of radiation, stellar winds, and
supernovae remain uncertain. Using medium-resolution spectra of six nearly
identical local star-forming galaxies, we directly trace, for the first time,
the evolution of a multiphase wind through individual spectral lines alongside
measurements of the LyC escape fraction. We find that LyC escape peaks early,
during a period dominated by intense radiation and stellar winds but lacking a
fast galactic wind. As the starbursts age, supernovae drive and accelerate the
wind, progressively suppressing LyC escape. These results highlight the need
for cosmological simulations to incorporate early feedback as a key driver of
reionization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20989v1" target="_blank"><h2>Spectroscopic Classification of Extragalactic Transients from CRTS</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  A. J. Drake, S. G. Djorgovski, M. J. Graham, D. Stern, A. A. Mahabal, M. Catelan, J. L. Prieto, S. Larson</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, Accepted MNRAS</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey
for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000
transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of
the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we
find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we
prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our
spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These
objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of
type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We
highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a
type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN
2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I
supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than
200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that
exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our
previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of
extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin
of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal
disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present
CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220
that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.</p></br></body>
