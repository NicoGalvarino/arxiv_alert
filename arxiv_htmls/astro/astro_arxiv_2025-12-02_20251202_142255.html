With JWST accessing the restframe UV and optical spectrum of this galaxy with high fidelity, we classify this UV-bright galaxy as post-starburst in nature -- due to weak/absent emission lines and strong absorption features -- making this an example of a new class of UV-bright but significantly quenched galaxies being discovered in this epoch. With a median $E(B-V)=0.44\pm0.14$, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected H$α$ star formation rate of SFR$_{Hα} = 0.024 \pm 0.001$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we find in the most "star-forming" clumps indications of lower ionization (log$_{10}$U $\sim -3.2$), lower nebular metallicities (12+log$_{10}$O/H $\lesssim$ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy. Investigating the regions with no detectable H$β$ emission, we find (for the first time at $z>5$) signatures of diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Separating DIG from HII regions within a galaxy has predominantly been demonstrated at lower redshifts, where such spatial resolution allows clear separation of such regions -- highlighting the immense power of gravitational lensing to enable studies at the smallest spatial scales at cosmic dawn.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01998v1" target="_blank"><h2>Constraining Dark Acoustic Oscillations with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jared Barron, David Curtin, Hongwan Liu, Julian Munoz, Sandip Roy<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 32 pages, 12 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> James Webb Space Telescope (abstract), ISM (abstract), high redshift (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) in the matter power spectrum can arise in many different dark sector models, and can imprint on a variety of cosmological observables. In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \gtrsim 50\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01901v1" target="_blank"><h2>Weak, extended water vapor emission in the Horsehead nebula</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Dariusz C.

Water emission in the Horsehead nebula is very weak and, surprisingly, extends outward beyond other PDR tracers such as $^{12}$CO or [CI] 609 $μ$m, reaching as far out as [CII] 158 $μ$m. We model the observations using a newly developed PDR wrapper that takes into account the geometry of this region. PDR modeling of the molecular and atomic lines studied here provides strong constraints on the thermal pressure, but not on the UV illumination. Maximum model line intensities %typically agree to within ~40\% with the observations. and spatial profiles are well reproduced, except for CO isotopologues, where the increase on the illuminated side of the PDR is steeper than observed. Water vapor abundance in the model reaches $3.6 \times 10^{-7}$ at $A_V \sim 3$ mag. However, the ground state $o$-H$_2$O 557 GHz line is systematically overestimated by the models by at least a factor of 7 for any values of the model parameters. This line has a very high optical depth and the emergent line intensity is sensitive to radiative transfer effects such as line scattering by water molecules in a low-density halo surrounding the dense PDR and the assumed microturbulent line width. A more accurate model of the water surface chemistry is required.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01898v1" target="_blank"><h2>On extremal black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Chiara Coviello, Ruth Gregory<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 1 figure<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We take a fresh look at the viability of physically realistic extremal black holes within our (non-supersymmetric) low energy physics. By incorporating prefactors and volume effects, we show that Schwinger discharge in charge neutral environments is far more efficient than commonly assumed. Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background. Taken together, our results provide a unified picture that extremal black holes of any type are unlikely to persist in our universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01684v1" target="_blank"><h2>Transition from Outside-in to Inside-Out at $z\sim 2$: Evidence from Radial Profiles of Specific Star Formation Rate based on JWST/HST</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jie Song, Enci Wang, Cheng Jia, Cheqiu Lyu, Yangyao Chen, Jinyang Wang, Fujia Li, Weiyu Ding, Guanwen Fang, Xu Kong<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> submitted to ApJS, comments are welcomed<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> By combining high-resolution observations from JWST and HST, we have measured the stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and multi-wavelength morphologies of galaxies in the CANDELS fields. Furthermore, based on rest-frame 1 $μ$m morphologies, we have derived spatially resolved stellar mass and SFR surface density ($Σ_*$ and $Σ_{\rm SFR}$) profiles for 46,313 galaxies with reliable structural measurements at $0 < z < 4$ and $\log(M_\ast /M_{\odot}) > 8$, and provide the corresponding catalogue. For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts ($z > 2.5$), the median radial profile of $Σ_{\rm SFR}$ is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of $Σ_*$. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at $z > 2.5$ cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at $z<2.0$, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01662v1" target="_blank"><h2>An outflow from the X-ray corona as the origin of millimeter emission from radio-quiet AGN</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_ν\sim{\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\rm mm}/L_X\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01622v1" target="_blank"><h2>Analytical Emulator for the Baryon EoM inside the Fuzzy Dark Matter Soliton from Machine Learning</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Ke Wang, Jianbo Lu, Man Ho Chan<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 7 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> baryon density (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> An empirical baryon density profile can be included in the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations to influence the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton formation.

In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\lesssim0.04$. It should also work well for some other simple FDM soliton evolutions.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01607v1" target="_blank"><h2>Accurate cosmological emulator for the probability distribution function of gravitational lensing of point sources</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Tunç Türker, Valerio Marra, Tiago Castro, Miguel Quartin, Stefano Borgani<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 10 pages, 15 figures (excluding appendices).

We construct a pipeline utilizing cosmological $N$-body simulations, creating past light cones to compute convergence and shear maps. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed for dimensionality reduction, followed by an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model to interpolate magnification PDFs across a broad cosmological parameter space ($Ω_m$, $σ_8$, $w$, $h$) and redshift range ($0.2 \le z \le 6$). We identify the optimal number of PCA components to balance accuracy and stability. Our emulator, publicly released as ace_lensing, accurately reproduces lensing PDFs with a median Kullback-Leibler divergence of $0.007$. Validation on the test set confirmed that the model reliably reproduces the detailed shapes and statistical properties of the PDFs across the explored parameter range, showing no significant degradation for specific parameter combinations or redshifts. Future work will focus on incorporating baryonic physics through hydrodynamical simulations and expanding the training set to further enhance model accuracy and generalizability.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01576v1" target="_blank"><h2>From Black Hole to Galaxy: Neural Operator: Framework for Accretion and Feedback Dynamics</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nihaal Bhojwani, Chuwei Wang, Hai-Yang Wang, Chang Sun, Elias R.

To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01547v1" target="_blank"><h2>Exploring the ultra-faint dwarf Bootes I using JWST and HST: Metallicity distribution and binaries</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> F.

Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars $\sim$85% have [Fe/H]<-2, and that roughly $\sim$17% have [Fe/H]<-3.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01530v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Hubble Missing Globular Cluster Survey.

When combined with Gaia positional measurements, this data set enables the investigation of the bulk motion and the internal kinematics of these poorly studied clusters to an unprecedented level of detail. Focusing on the case of NGC 6749, we here showcase how the combined Gaia HST proper motions have a quality sufficient to accurately assess the cluster stellar membership, determine its absolute proper motion with a precision superior to Gaia, and to investigate its kinematic profile for the first time. Proper motions are determined using the public code GAIAHUB, which for NGC 6749 combines data sets separated in time by 8 years. The resulting measurements improve the precision of Gaia proper motions by a factor of 10 at the faint end, and enable recovering the proper motion for 662 stars for which Gaia could only measure the positions. These proper motions are efficient in decontaminating the colour magnitude diagram of NGC 6749, and make it possible to compare the efficacy of a method of statistical decontamination that relies only on the photometric information extracted from the HST parallel fields. Finally, using the sample of best measured proper motions we determine the velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of NGC 6749, that reveal an isotropic behaviour in the cluster inner regions and a slight radial anisotropy outside 1.5 half light radii. The proper motions and the code to statistically decontaminate the clusters color magnitude diagram are made available as public products of the survey.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01503v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger astrophysical data: The influences of parametrizations of density dependent couplings</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Guo-Jun Wei, Jia-Jie Li, Armen Sedrakian, Yong-Jia Wang, Qing-Feng Li, Fu-Hu Liu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, nucl-th<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 5 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> baryon density (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Covariant density functionals have been successfully applied to the description of finite nuclei and dense nuclear matter. These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter. In contrast, the isovector channel requires further refinement, with freedom extended at least up to the curvature coefficient $K_{sym}$ to capture variations in the symmetry energy and particle composition at high densities. This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01489v1" target="_blank"><h2>Euclid: The first statistical census of dusty and massive objects in the ERO/Perseus field</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> G.

Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at $z=3$-$6$ with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion $H_{\mathrm{E}}-\mathrm{ch2}>2.25$. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\rm H}α$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5<z<5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01404v1" target="_blank"><h2>Resonant Annihilation of WIMP Dark Matter for Halo Gamma Ray Signal</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hitoshi Murayama<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> hep-ph, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 5 pages, 2 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We propose a resonant annihilation as a way to reconcile the WIMP annihilation cross sections in a recently reported gamma ray signal from the Milky Way halo with that for the freeze-out and the upper limit from dwarf galaxies.

We investigated sGRBs in the Fermi-GBM dataset based on their MeV-GeV $γ$-ray emission features, to identify sGRBs similar to sGRB 170817A. Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events.

We combine MW satellite observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) with M31 satellite data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), and model the corresponding observable satellite populations using the galaxy--halo connection model together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.75 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.41 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). For thermal-relic WDM, we find $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} > 6.22~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} > 5.75~\mathrm{keV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). These results represent a moderate improvement over MW-only constraints, and provide the strongest constraints to date on the FDM and WDM derived from satellite galaxy populations in the Local Group.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01288v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting wideband pulsar timing measurement</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Abhimanyu Susobhanan, Avinash Kumar Paladi, Réka Desmecht, Amarnath, Manjari Bagchi, Manoneeta Chakraborty, Shaswata Chowdhury, Suruj Jyoti Das, Debabrata Deb, Shantanu Desai, Churchil Dwivedi, Himanshu Grover, Jibin Jose, Bhal Chandra Joshi, Shubham Kala, Fazal Kareem, Kuldeep Meena, Sushovan Mondal, K Nobleson, Arul Pandian B, Kaustubh Rai, Adya Shukla, Manpreet Singh, Aman Srivastava, Mayuresh Surnis, Hemanga Tahbildar, Keitaro Takahashi, Pratik Tarafdar, Kunjal Vara, Vaishnavi Vyasraj, Zenia Zuraiq<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-12-01<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> IGM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, the time of arrival of a pulsar pulse is measured simultaneously with the corresponding dispersion measure from a frequency-resolved integrated pulse profile.

Using 59.0 hours of data from the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver and 6.3 hours from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 19-beam receiver, we searched for repeated bursts from these sources. No additional bursts were detected from any of the 27 FRBs. Combining these non-detections with prior archival observations, we derived stringent upper limits on their repetition rates above 1 Jy under two statistical models: Poisson process constraints range from $\sim10^{-3.5}$ to $10^{-1.9}\,\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, while Weibull process constraints range from $\sim10^{-3.4}$ to $10^{-1.5}\,\mathrm{h^{-1}}$. These limits are approximately an order of magnitude stricter than those reported in previous studies. By applying consistent observational setups and analytical methodologies across all sources, the derived rate limits converge to a narrow, well-defined range. This suggests that these FRBs form a relatively homogeneous population with extremely low intrinsic activity rates.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01261v1" target="_blank"><h2>OzDES Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei: Final Data Release, Black-Hole Mass Results, & Scaling Relations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> H.

Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\log_{10}(L_{\mathrm{bol}})\in [44.3, 47.5] \mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01260v1" target="_blank"><h2>OzDES Reverberation Mapping Program: CIV lags from six years of data</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

We use new radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) telescope, as well as several archival radio observations, to calculate spectral indices, and find a steep spectral index for the whole SNR ($α= -0.60\pm0.02$), and a flatter spectral index for the PWN ($α= -0.16\pm0.03$). We also measure the polarisation and magnetic field properties of the PWN. Previously reported as a linear structure, the new observations show an unusual "zig-zag"-like structure, visible in radio-continuum total intensity, linear polarisation, and magnetic field orientations. The origin of this zig-zag structure is unclear, but we propose some origin scenarios that will require further observations to differentiate between.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01176v1" target="_blank"><h2>Revisiting the Supernova Engines in the 3C 397 and W49B Supernova Remnants</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Cole Treyturik, Chelsea Braun, Samar Safi-Harb, Christopher L.

To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B's composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$α$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region -- highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification. Our results highlight the need for caution in relying on any single diagnostic or nucleosynthesis model for supernova typing, underscore the need for improved nucleosynthesis models, and motivate future high-resolution, high-throughput observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01053v1" target="_blank"><h2>The jetted NLS1 1H 0323+342: the Rosetta stone for accretion/ejection in AGN</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Luigi Foschini<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 13 pages, 8 figures.

However, most of the known pulsar-binary systems expected to provide this opportunity will exhibit linear variations in the orbital elements due to LT precession that are difficult to separate from variations induced by other mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00917v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the Scalar Hair of Rotating Horndeski Black Holes through Thick Disk Images</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Qian Wan, Yehui Hou, Minyong Guo<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> gr-qc, astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 16 pages, 8 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Horizon-scale images of black holes provide a potential probe of fundamental physics, including tests of gravity and black hole hair.

Using the EHT data, we find that the DM parameter is restricted to a narrow allowed range, confined to values of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$. Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration.

Using raw rotation curve data from IOA Tokyo's publicly available repository, we model each galaxy's mass distribution via a three-component decomposition (Hernquist bulge, exponential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo) fit using Monte Carlo simulations. The onset of dark matter dominance was identified using the NFW scale radius, beyond which we computed the total enclosed mass via Keplerian dynamics. I-band luminosities for these regions were estimated using a calibrated Tully-Fisher relation, yielding precise mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. We further calculated dark matter mass and density using NFW profile equations, and galaxy ages were retrieved through an extensive literature survey of stellar population studies.
  Our analysis reveals strong positive correlations between galactic age and both dark matter mass (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $ρ\approx 0.93$) and density (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $ρ\approx 0.91$), as well as M/L ratios, suggesting a robust link between evolutionary history and dark matter build-up. These findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions from large-scale cosmological simulations that incorporate assembly bias and smooth accretion-dominated growth, reinforcing the view that older galaxies, having formed earlier in high-density peaks, have accumulated significantly more dark matter over cosmic time. Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00822v1" target="_blank"><h2>On the multiplicity of red-Herschel sources and its implications for extreme star formation</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Marianela Quirós-Rojas, Alfredo Montaña, Jorge A.

Out of 2416 fields with ALMA detections (from a total of 3,089 analyzed maps), we identify 474 multiple systems within a radius of 16 arcsec (equivalent to the 500 $μ$m Herschel beam-size): 420 doubles, 51 triples, and 3 quadruples. In each case the brightest source contributes, on average, 64, 48, and 42 per cent of the total flux in double, triple, and quadruple systems. The average combined ALMA flux density of the sources in double systems is comparable to that of the two brightest components within triple and quadruple systems. Non-parametric tests suggest that only a small fraction of the double systems ($\lesssim13$ per cent) are comprised of sources with compatible redshifts, while 47-67 per cent of triple and quadruple fields contain at least one potentially associated pair. Simulations using a mock catalogue of dusty star-forming galaxies suggest that 32 per cent of the double systems are likely physically associated ($Δz < 0.01$, i.e. $\lesssim$10 comoving Mpc at $z = 3$) and, while only 8 per cent of the triple and none of the quadruple systems meet this criterion, $\sim$ 70 per cent of them include at least one likely associated pair. Our results suggest that enhanced star formation rates in submillimetre galaxies are primarily driven by internal processes rather than large-scale interactions.

Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00750v1" target="_blank"><h2>Broadband Spectral Analysis of 1ES2344+514: A Multi-epoch study</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Kishor Chaudhury, Abhradeep Roy, Varsha R.

We used nearly simultaneous data obtained from 2017 June 6 to 2022 August 6 (MJD 57910 -- 59797) in optical, UV, X-ray and $γ$-ray wavebands from various instruments including Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, AstroSat (SXT and LAXPC), Fermi-LAT, and TeV flux from MAGIC. During 2017 July, 1ES 2344+514 appeared to be in the highest flaring state compared to other periods. We used the 0.5 -- 7.0 keV and 3.0 -- 20.0 keV data, respectively, from SXT and LAXPC of AstroSat and also 0.3 -- 8.0 keV and 3.0 -- 79.0 keV data, respectively, from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. A joint fit between SXT and LAXPC, and between Swift-XRT and NuSTAR has been done for constraining the synchrotron peak. A clear shift in the synchrotron peak has been observed, which included 1ES 2344+514 in the HSP BL Lac family. A `harder-when-brighter' trend is observed in X-rays, and the opposite trend, i.e., `softer-when-brighter', is seen in the $γ$-rays. The multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this source were built and studied to get an idea of the radiation processes. The SEDs were fitted using a steady-state leptonic one-zone synchrotron+SSC model, and the fitted parameters of the emission region are consistent with those of other TeV BL Lacs. In this study, we found a weak correlation tendency between bolometric luminosity and magnetic field (B), as well as between bolometric luminosity and the break Lorentz factor ($γ_{break}$).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00730v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evidence for the Faint-End Suppression in the z = 6 $\sim$ 8 UV Luminosity Function: A Lensing Analysis of Abell 2744</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Xuheng Ma<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 14 pages; 10 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-30<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We determine the $z=6-8$ ultraviolet (UV) LF in the JWST UNCOVER field behind Abell 2744, through a depth-tied completeness model and source-plane selection taking multiple images into account. We compute the intrinsic $M_{UV}$ LFs and lens-dependent effective volumes $V_{eff,\ell}(M_{UV})$ for two of them (CATS, GLAFIC), and construct binned LFs with statistical (Gehrels) errors presented separately from the lens-model spread. When fitting each lens model independently with both the original and turnover-extended form (while keeping $M^*=-20.5$), we obtain decisive model selection in favour of a faint-end turnover. The peak of the turnover posteriors is at $α\simeq -1$, $β\simeq 1.6$, and drive $M_T$ to the high side of our prior ($\sim -18$) and the difference in normalization between CATS-GLAFIC is absorbed into $φ^*$. A similar magnification-bias test in the image plane gives a $B(μ)$ trend matching to what is expected, which provides an internal consistency of our selection and volumes. Our results indicate an early suppression of the UV LF at $z=6-8$, and carry implications for the ionizing contribution of ultra-faint systems during reionization.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00666v1" target="_blank"><h2>Controlling weak-lensing shear biases from undetected galaxies in the era of Stage IV Surveys</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Lisa M Voigt<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 22 pages, 18 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), AGN (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Gravitational lensing of background galaxies by intervening matter is a powerful probe of the cosmological model. In the era of Stage IV surveys, contamination from galaxies below the detection threshold has emerged as a significant source of bias. Adopting a noise-bias-free machine-learning method to estimate shear, we quantify the impact of faint galaxies for a Euclid-like survey. In our baseline simulations, faint blends induce a multiplicative shear bias of -0.008, well above Euclid's requirement. Similar to previous studies, we find that calibration simulations must include neighbouring galaxies to AB apparent magnitudes as faint as 27.0 (+2.1, -0.9) and within approximately 1.0 (+0.2, -0.2) arcsec of each bright sample galaxy (BSG; the galaxy for which shear is measured). By varying faint galaxy properties, we identify which ones significantly affect shear biases and quantify how well they must be constrained. Crucially, we find that biases not only depend on the mean projected faint-galaxy density and apparent-magnitude distribution across the sample, but also on how these quantities vary with the observed brightness of the BSG. Furthermore, biases are sensitive to radial and tangential alignments and positional anisotropy of faint galaxies relative to BSGs. By contrast, shear coherence between BSGs and faint galaxies, parallel orientation alignments, and variations in the faint galaxy size-magnitude relation have negligible impact within the parameter ranges explored. Our results guide calibration simulations and highlight the critical role of deep observations in measuring the properties of faint galaxies.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00650v1" target="_blank"><h2>Uniformly-calibrated VPHAS+ photometry in the third quadrant of the Galactic plane</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> J.

Anticipating the release of a uniform photometric calibration of the entire survey, we examine the properties of VPHAS+ ugriHa photometry of r < 19 mag. point sources in the third Galactic quadrant (longitudes 210^o to 260^o). We compare our interim calibration in gri with that of Pan-STARRS, the DECam Plane Survey (DECaPS-2) and Skymapper. We use the comparisons to identify small gri photometric offsets. Corrections to the Ha and u magnitude scales are determined via comparison with synthetic photometry. VPHAS+ and its northern counterpart, the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), are shown to closely align, where they overlap across the celestial equator. Aided by Gaia Data Release 3, SIMBAD, and specialist catalogues, we present selections of: A stars; sub-luminous stars; intrinsically-red luminous stars; young stellar objects; emission-line and OB stars. Attention is drawn to stellar variability as a contaminant in selecting emission line objects via (r - Ha) excess. It is argued the (r - i, r - Ha) plane is the better choice for this selection than (g - i, r - Ha). Using A stars to map extinction, we trace the main run of dust obscuration, situated at mainly negative Galactic latitudes. Like the dust, OB and emission line stars are more frequent below the Galactic equator: at heliocentric distances of up to ~7 kpc, these stars' distribution fit in with the known warping of the Galactic plane. An overdensity of B stars, several degrees across and potentially in the Outer Arm, is found around (l,b) = (212.0, -0.6).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00589v1" target="_blank"><h2>XRISM Observations of Accretion Disk Corona in Cyg X-2</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Misaki Mizumoto, Hiromitsu Takahashi, Ehud Behar, Rozenn Boissay-Malaquin, Lia Corrales, Elisa Costantini, Maria Diaz-Trigo, Eric D.

The observations have enabled a precise characterization of the Fe-K emission lines from the accretion disk corona (ADC) and a possible detection of an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). The ADC component has at least two distinct regions. The Fe-K emission lines are remarkably broad, with a velocity dispersion of $σ_v=2300^{+900}_{-700}$~km~s$^{-1}$. This can be larger than what was observed in previous Chandra observations ($1120\pm870$~km~s$^{-1}$) and recent XRISM observations of the similar Z-source GX 340+0 (360--800~km~s$^{-1}$). Furthermore, we marginally detect a blueshifted absorption feature, which we identify as either \ion{Fe}{26} or \ion{Fe}{25}, with outflow velocities of $-0.29c$ or $-0.26c$, respectively. The mass loss rate is $\dot{M}\sim10^{-8}M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.

In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $Λ$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00402v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing Fuzzy Dark Matter in the 21 cm Signal via Wavelet Scattering Transform</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hayato Shimabukuro, Shihang Liu, Bohua Li<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 20 pages, 11 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-29<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> intergalactic medium (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We explore the imprints of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the redshifted 21~cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization by employing the wavelet scattering transform (WST). FDM, composed of ultralight scalar particles with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} \sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, exhibits quantum pressure that suppresses the formation of small-scale structures below the de~Broglie wavelength, thereby delaying star formation and modifying the thermal history of the intergalactic medium. Using modified \texttt{21cmFAST} simulations that incorporate both linear and nonlinear effects of FDM on structure formation, we analyze the two-dimensional 21~cm brightness temperature fields through the first- and second-order WST coefficients. The first-order coefficients, $S_1(j)$, quantify scale-dependent variance analogous to the power spectrum, while the normalized second-order ratio $R(j_1,j_2)=S_2/S_1$ captures non-Gaussian cross-scale couplings. We find that low-order couplings, particularly between large and intermediate scales, are highly sensitive to the FDM particle mass and remain robust under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise. Quantitatively, the WST coefficients yield pairwise distances of $Δ\simeq 225$ between CDM and FDM with $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}=10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, demonstrating that this framework can effectively discriminate between wave-like and cold dark matter scenarios even under realistic observational conditions. Our results establish the WST as a powerful, noise-tolerant statistical tool for probing the wave nature of dark matter through forthcoming 21~cm observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00174v1" target="_blank"><h2>Recoiling Black Hole Candidates from Spatially Offset Broad Emission Lines in MaNGA</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> R.

In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in on-going galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical `slingshot' mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect co-evolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits (~2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ~10-600 km/s and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00169v1" target="_blank"><h2>Dynamical Heating from Dark Compact Objects and Axion Minihalos: Implications for the 21-cm Signal</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Badal Bhalla, Aurora Ireland, Hongwan Liu, Huangyu Xiao, Tao Xu<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 6+6 pages, 2 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The temperature of baryons at the end of the cosmic dark ages can be inferred from observations of the 21-cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen.

Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $ν$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00162v1" target="_blank"><h2>CECILIA: The Mass-Metallicity Relation of Low-Mass Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Menelaos Raptis, Gwen C.

We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory.

If the shock upstream is optically thick, radiation smoothens the velocity discontinuity at the shock (radiation-mediated shocks). However, in mildly magnetized outflows, a collisionless subshock can form, enhancing the efficiency of particle acceleration. We solve the hydrodynamic equations of a steady-state, radiation-mediated shock together with the radiative transfer equations accounting for electron and proton acceleration. Our goal is to explore the impact of the magnetic field and non-thermal radiation on the shock structure and the resulting spectral distribution of photons. To this purpose, we assume a relativistic upstream fluid velocity ($Γ_u = 10$) and investigate shock configurations with variable upstream magnetization ($σ_u = 0$, $10^{-8}$, $10^{-4}$, $0.1$, and $0.3$). We find that synchrotron self-absorption alters the shock profile for $σ_u \gtrsim 10^{-8}$, with resulting changes up to $100\%$ in the bulk Lorentz factor at the shock; for $σ_u \gtrsim 0.1$, a prominent subshock forms. The spectral energy distributions of upstream- and downstream-going photons are also altered. Radiative processes linked to accelerated protons are responsible for a high-energy ($\gtrsim 10$ GeV) tail in the photon spectrum; however, the radiation flux and pressure are negligibly affected with consequent minor impact on the shock structure. Our work highlights the importance of coupling the shock hydrodynamics to the transport of photons, electrons, protons, and intermediate particles to forecast the multi-messenger emission from astrophysical transients.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00145v1" target="_blank"><h2>The role of prompt cusps in driving the core collapse of SIDM halos</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Vinh Tran, Daniel Gilman, M.

Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\,{\rm{M}}_\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\sim 5\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between the inner and outer halo profiles in determining the onset of core collapse and motivate future studies in the full cosmological context.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00147v1" target="_blank"><h2>The ALMA Survey of 70 μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES).

We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of $-2.05\pm0.04$, shallower than Salpeter's IMF slope of -2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope ($-2.32\pm0.30$), indistinguishable from Salpeter's slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00148v1" target="_blank"><h2>The DREAMS Project: A New Suite of 1,024 Simulations to Contextualize the Milky Way and Assess Physics Uncertainties</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jonah C.

Each simulation in the suite has a unique set of initial conditions and combination of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. The suite is designed to quantify theoretical uncertainties from halo-to-halo variance, as well as stellar and black hole feedback. We develop a novel weighting scheme that prioritizes regions of the input parameter space, yielding galaxies consistent with the observed present-day stellar mass--halo mass relation. The resulting galaxy population exhibits a wide diversity in structural properties that encompasses those of the actual Milky Way, providing a powerful statistical sample for galactic archaeology. To demonstrate the suite's scientific utility, we investigate the connection between a galaxy's merger history, focusing on Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus~(GSE) analogs, and its present-day properties. We find that galaxies with a GSE analog have lower star formation rates, more compact disks, and more spherical stellar halos. Crucially, significant halo-to-halo scatter remains, demonstrating that matching more than the most significant events in the Milky Way's past is necessary to recover its present-day properties. Our results highlight the necessity for large statistical samples to disentangle the stochastic nature of galaxy formation and robustly model the Milky Way's unique history.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23463v1" target="_blank"><h2>Kinetic Mixing and the Phantom Illusion: Axion-Dilaton Quintessence in Light of DESI DR2 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Michael W.

Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5σ$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1σ$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3σ$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1σ$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7σ$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23459v1" target="_blank"><h2>Baryon fraction from the BAO amplitude: a consistent approach to parameterizing perturbation growth <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Andrea Crespi, Will J.

This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23452v1" target="_blank"><h2>From metallicity distributions to mutual information: A new perspective on stellar halo assembly <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Amit Mondal, Biswajit Pandey<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 18 pages, 7 figures, comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract), halo (title, abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The metallicity structure of stellar halos encodes the fossil record of galaxy assembly, tracing the chemical evolution and dynamical imprint of past mergers. Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23432v1" target="_blank"><h2>A measurement of $H_0$ from DESI DR1 using energy densities <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Alex Krolewski, Andrea Crespi, Will J.

We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($Ω_{\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $Λ$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant. We consider the impact of non-standard dark energy evolution on our measurement. Future data, including that from further iterations of DESI and from Euclid, will add to these results providing a powerful test of the Hubble tension.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23426v1" target="_blank"><h2>Variation of Microphysical Parameters in Reverse-shock Scenario <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Nissim Fraija, Boris Betancourt-Kamenetskaia, Antonio Galván, Maria Dainotti<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 36 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables.

The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone. The current model is employed to examine the evolution of the spectral and temporal indices of GRBs reported in the Second Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) and bursts detected at very high energies, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23417v1" target="_blank"><h2>Detection of the Pairwise Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Pairwise Velocity with DESI DR1 Galaxies and ACT DR6 and Planck CMB Data <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Yulin Gong, Patricio A.

This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23356v1" target="_blank"><h2>Investigating the Impacts of AGN Activities on Dwarf Galaxies with FAST HI Observations <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Hong-Ying Chen, Chao-Wei Tsai, Pei Zuo, Niankun Yu, Jialai Wang, Kai Zhang, Guodong Li, Yogesh Chandola, Zheng Zheng, Jingwen Wu, Di Li, Lulu Bao<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 24 pages, 6 figures<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract), AGN (title, abstract), active galactic nuclei (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> We present the results of Hi line observations towards 26 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)-hosting and one star-forming dwarf galaxies (Mstar < 10^9.5 Msun) with the 19-beam spectral line receiver of FAST at 1.4 GHz. Our FAST observed targets are combined with other AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies covered in the ALFALFA footprint to form a more comprehensive sample. Utilizing the information from optical surveys, we further divide them into isolated and accompanied subsamples by their vicinity of nearby massive galaxies. We compare the Hi gas abundance and star-forming rate (SFR) between the subsamples to assess the role of internal and external processes that may regulate the gas content in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we find that AGN are more commonly identified in accompanied dwarf galaxies than in their isolated counterparts. Meanwhile, AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies have slightly but significant lower Hi mass fraction relatively to the non-AGN control sample in accompanied dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23349v1" target="_blank"><h2>Synchrotron Self-Compton Model of TeV Afterglows in Gamma-Ray Bursts <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to MNRAS<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$. A shallower external medium density profile ($k<2$) departs from the canonical approximation of a steady wind ($k=2$) from the progenitor star and may indicate a non-steady wind or a transition to an interstellar medium.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23314v1" target="_blank"><h2>Stellar streams around dwarf galaxies in the Local Universe <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Joanna D.

Stellar streams trace satellite disruption and, in the dwarf galaxy regime, are predicted to provide novel constraints on low-mass galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the mass ratios required to form these streams make them challenging to detect. We present a preview of the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey (SSLS) in the dwarf galaxy regime. The SSLS aims to produce a statistically large, homogeneous sample of stellar streams, in order to yield new constraints on galaxy formation through comparison with theory. We visually inspect dwarf galaxies using the Legacy Imaging Survey (and DECaLS footprints, r-band 29 mag arcsec-2) within 4-35 Mpc. We develop a classification metric to categorise accretion debris around dwarf galaxies, and measure the frequency of accretion features in the footprint. We present the first release of accretion features around dwarf galaxies, including 1 stream, 11 shells, and 8 asymmetric stellar halos, of which 17 constitute new identifications. We find that less than 5.07 percent of dwarfs (37/730) contain detectable accretion features, which is lower than the SSLS results for massive galaxies, and discuss a tentative shell detection bias. Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarf galaxies, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies. Nevertheless, they place observational constraints on hierarchical mass assembly in this regime.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23305v1" target="_blank"><h2>Calcium versus silicon ejecta velocities and decline rates in supernovae Ia: The role of high-velocity features <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> A.

We analyse a representative sample of 145 nearby SNe Ia observed within $\pm$5 days of B-band maximum light, including normal, 91T-, and 91bg-like events with measured light-curve decline rates ($Δm_{15}$) and Si II and Ca II line properties from the literature. We model PVF and HVF velocity distributions using Gaussian Mixture Models, compare Si II and Ca II PVF velocity distributions, assess Ca II HVF properties, and test correlations between Si II PVF velocities and $Δm_{15}$, with emphasis on HVF effects. For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($>3.3σ$) between $Δm_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($>3.3σ$) between Si II PVF velocity and $Δm_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction. These results underscore the critical role of HVFs and SN Ia subclass in interpreting ejecta kinematics in both models and observations.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23267v1" target="_blank"><h2>Simulating AGN feedback in galaxy clusters with pre-existing turbulence <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Jia-Lun Li, H. -Y.

Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23263v1" target="_blank"><h2>Macroscopic Dark Matter under siege: from White Dwarf Data to Gravitational Wave Detection <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Siyu Jiang, Aidi Yang, Fa Peng Huang<br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.HE, hep-ph<br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 8+12 pages, 3+6 figures, 0+1 table, comments are welcome<br><strong><u>Published:</u></strong> 2025-11-28<br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> LLS (abstract)<br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The nature of dark matter (DM) remains a profound mystery.

By combining these updated white dwarf/neutron star limits with the projected gravitational wave sensitivities, we derive the most comprehensive constraints on Fermi-ball parameter space to date, demonstrating the power of multi-messenger approaches for probing macroscopic DM.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23219v1" target="_blank"><h2>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Suratna Das, Umang Kumar, Swagat S.

Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23168v1" target="_blank"><h2>An improved formalism for measuring the dark matter subhalos mass by its gravitational wake <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> M.

In particular, we aim to include different density distribution functions for the perturber and a non homogeneous background due to the host's halo gravitational potential. We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc.</p><br><hr><br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.23164v1" target="_blank"><h2>Bursty star formation, chemical enrichment, and star cluster formation in numerical analogues of GN-z11 <span style="color: #999; font-size: 0.8em;">(seen before)</span></h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong> Takayuki R.

The origin of this chemical signature provides an insight into the early star and galaxy formation processes, yet remains unclear. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z\sim10$) in rare density peaks, incorporating various chemical evolution channels including stellar winds, core-collapse, Type Ia supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations reproduce several key features of high-redshift galaxies: (1) stars form with high efficiencies ($>0.1$) at the center of rare peak halos, creating very compact galaxies similar to GN-z11; (2) high N/O ratios emerge during the first 10-20 Myr of intense starburst, before being diluted by CCSNe; (3) multiple star clusters form in and around the galaxy with high efficiency ($\sim20\%$), some of which exhibit high N/O ratios and sodium-oxygen anti-correlations similar to those observed in local globular clusters. Although our simulations can reproduce the high log(N/O) values (up to -0.61, exceeding the solar value by 0.25 dex), they remain below the observational lower limits of GN-z11, indicating room for improvement through additional chemical evolution channels, such as supermassive stars.</p><br><hr><br><hr><p><em>Summary: Showing 62 papers (47 new, 15 seen before)</em></p></body></html>
