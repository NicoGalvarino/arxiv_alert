at very high redshift ($>$4) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allowed
us to shed light for the very first time on the early evolutionary phases of
active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps unsurprisingly, several of the physical
properties observed in these new objects, including those known as little red
dots (LRDs), are closely reminiscent of the low-mass and high-Eddington AGN in
the local Universe, and in particular of the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1
(NLS1) galaxies. However, some differences also emerged, likely due to the
radically different evolutionary path and the environment where LRDs and NLS1s
live. In this work, we review the multiwavelength properties of local NLS1s and
compare them with type 1 AGN found at high-$z$, showing that despite some
differences, the study of NLS1s can be extremely useful to better understand
the extreme accretion physics of high-$z$ quasars and the early stages of AGN
evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03912v1" target="_blank"><h2>A large thermal energy reservoir in the nascent intracluster medium at a

($\boldsymbol{\gtrsim10^7\,\rm}\mathrm{K}$), forming the intracluster medium
(ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the
ICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas
in younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB)
photons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic
electrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long
wavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and
pressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three
systems at or above $z\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making
the time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations
of this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular
gas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three
radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$,
corresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal
implies a thermal energy of $\mathbf{\sim 10^{61}\,\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding
the possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to
current theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56
demonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of
thermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in
unrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters
emerged at $\mathbf{z \sim 2}$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03590v1" target="_blank"><h2>Fueling, Evolution, and Diversity of AGN in Dwarf Galaxies: Insights

in a sample of 1451 AGN hosted by dwarf galaxies at redshift 0.5 to 0.9, drawn
from the VIPERS survey. The sample comprises Seyferts and LINERs identified
through emission-line diagnostics, as well as IR-selected AGN based on WISE
colors. Using the parameter SFRnorm, defined as the ratio of the SFR of a
galaxy hosting an AGN to the median SFR of star-forming galaxies of similar
stellar mass and redshift, we compare AGN hosts to a control sample of non-AGN
star-forming galaxies. We examine how SFRnorm varies with AGN power ([O III]
luminosity), black hole mass, local environment, and stellar population age. We
also analyze the MBH-Mstar relation and the evolution of the MBH/Mstar ratio,
incorporating comparisons to X-ray AGN and high-redshift quasars (z > 4). Our
key findings are: (i) all AGN populations show suppressed star formation at low
AGN luminosities, with SFRnorm rising above unity at different luminosity
thresholds depending on AGN type; (ii) LINERs show flat SFRnorm trends with
MBH, remaining broadly consistent with unity; Seyferts display a mild increase
with MBH, while IR AGN show a more pronounced positive trend; (iii) LINERs
exhibit older stellar populations than Seyferts; (iv) at fixed stellar mass,
Seyferts host more massive black holes than LINERs, with IR AGN falling in
between; (v) the MBH/Mstar ratio is elevated relative to local scaling
relations and remains approximately constant with redshift, in agreement with
high-z AGN; (vi) the ratio decreases with stellar mass up to log(Mstar/Msun)
approximately 11, beyond which it flattens toward values consistent with those
of local, inactive galaxies, with this trend clearest for Seyferts and IR AGN.
These results suggest that AGN in dwarf galaxies follow diverse evolutionary
pathways shaped by gas availability, feedback, and selection effects.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03858v1" target="_blank"><h2>Confirming lensed-quasar candidates with DESI and P200 spectroscopy I.

supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and the distribution of dark
matter. We cross-match 1,724 previously identified candidates from HSC, KiDS,
and the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS) with DESI DR1, obtaining 937 DESI
spectra for 677 unique systems. Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations
from the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three
lensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii
of 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11
high-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular
isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling,
and have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius
spans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of
the 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only
one quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the
other image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report
eight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses. These results
provide valuable targets for follow-up studies and underscore the efficiency of
wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as DESI in confirming gravitationally
lensed quasars and galaxies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04371v1" target="_blank"><h2>J-PAS: Discovery of RaJav, a bright spatially extended Ly$α$ Nebula

quasar JPAS-9600-10844, at 2.265 $\pm$ 0.021 using the early data release (17

the presence of a giant Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebula (ELAN). The nebula traces an
over density of quasars at redshift of 2.2-2.3 consistent with the progenitor
of a massive galaxy cluster. The extended CIV emission indicates that the
circum-galactic medium (CGM) is metal-enriched and not primordial. The current
J-PAS observations suggest photoionization and shocks due to outflows as
possible ionization mechanisms. The faint extended FUV and NUV continuum
emission likely points to ongoing star formation around the two quasars,
suggesting a complex interaction in their environments. These findings provide
new insights into the environment of quasars and their role in shaping the
dynamics and evolution of the CGM at cosmic noon. Further spectroscopic
observations will be required to fully characterize the object's nature and its
kinematic properties. This study demonstrates the unique capability of J-PAS to
detect massive and rare Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, providing new insights into their

accretion onto galaxies in the surrounding regions are quantified using
cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. With an appropriate amount of
radio jet energy injected into the intergalactic medium following the formation
peak of supermassive black holes at redshift two, we find that galaxies in the
greater neighborhood of the jet-launching massive galaxies subsequently
experience a significant reduction in the amount of accreted gas. The
distribution of the resulting magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is
highly inhomogeneous, due to the highly biased nature of the most massive
supermassive black holes. In regions with magnetic field strength
$B>10^{-2}\mu$G, the baryon fraction is on average reduced by 17%, 14%, and
12%, respectively, for halos of mass in the range of $[10^{11}-10^{12})\msun$,
$[10^{12}-10^{13})\msun$, and $[10^{13}-10^{14})\msun$. A proper inclusion of
this new, external, global, preventive feedback mechanism from AGN in the next

10-100 million degree X-ray-emitting gas. Their evolution is shaped by
energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and
mergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas
kinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of
gas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution
spectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising
solution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray
Observatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest
Perseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We
find direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas
motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the
inner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale
driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a
heating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This
finding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates
turbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role
in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study
underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources
for robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role
in the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic
diagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04224v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmography via stellar archaeology of low-redshift early-type galaxies

history of the Universe via the dating of passively evolving objects. This
enables testing the validity of cosmological models without concrete
assumptions of their energy content. The main goal of this work is to derive
model-independent constraints on the Hubble parameter up to $z \sim 0.4$ using
stellar ages from the fitting of Lick index absorption lines in passively
evolving galaxies. Contrary to recent related works that rely on finite
differences to obtain a discrete measurement of the expansion of the Universe
at an average redshift, our goal is to perform a cosmographic fit of $H(z)$ in
terms of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk
($j_0$) parameters. We carefully select spectra of massive and passively
evolving galaxies from the SDSS Legacy Survey. After applying a stacking
procedure to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio, the strength of Lick indices
is fit using two stellar population models (TMJ and Knowles) to derive stellar
population parameters. A cosmographic fit to the stellar ages is performed,
which in turn enables the sampling of the Hubble parameter within the
considered redshift range. The baseline result comes from using the
TMJ-modelled ages, and it yields a value of $H_0 = 70.0^{+4.1}_{-7.6} \text{ km
s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ for the Hubble constant, where uncertainties refer
only to the statistical treatment of the data. The sampling of the Hubble
parameter at $0.05 < z < 0.35$ is competitive with discreet model-independent
measurements from the literature. We finally draw attention to an unexpected
oscillating pattern in a number of critical indices with respect to redshift,
which translates into a similar behaviour in the $t-z$ relations. These
features have never been discussed before, although they are present in
previous measurements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03585v1" target="_blank"><h2>The clustering of C IV and Si IV at the end of reionisation: A

that they arise in as a function of cosmic time. We focus on C IV and Si IV
absorption features that are identified along a given quasar sightline. We
exploit the two-point correlation function (2PCF) to investigate the clustering
of these structures as a function of their separation. We utilise the E-XQR-30
data to perform a novel analysis at z>5. We also draw on literature surveys
(including XQ-100) of lower redshift quasars to investigate the possible
evolution of this clustering towards cosmic noon (i.e., z~2-3). We find no
significant evolution with redshift when considering the separation of
absorbers in velocity space. Since we are comparing data across a large
interval of cosmic time, we also consider the separation between absorbers in
the reference frame of physical distances. In this reference frame, we find
that the amplitude of the clustering increases with cosmic time for both C IV
and Si IV on the scales of <1500 physical kpc. For the first time, we assess
the 2PCF of C IV and Si IV close to the epoch of reionisation utilising the
absorber catalogue from the E-XQR-30 survey. We compare this with lower
redshift data and find that, on small scales, the clustering of these
structures grows with cosmic time. We compare these results to the clustering
of galaxies in the GAEA simulations. It appears that the structures traced by C
IV are broadly comparable to the galaxies from the considered simulations. The
clustering is most similar to that of the galaxies with virial masses M~10^10.5
M_sun. We require tailor-made simulations to investigate the full range of
factors contributing to the observed clustering. Future ground-based
spectrographs will further facilitate surveys of absorbers at this epoch with
increased sensitivity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04067v1" target="_blank"><h2>COLIBRE: calibrating subgrid feedback in cosmological simulations that

feedback in the subgrid model for the new COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations of

COLIBRE is calibrated at three resolutions: particle masses of $m_{\rm gas}
\approx m_{\rm dm} \sim 10^7$ (m7), $10^6$ (m6), and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$
(m5). To calibrate the COLIBRE feedback at m7 resolution, we run Latin
hypercubes of $\approx 200$ simulations that vary up to four subgrid parameters
in cosmological volumes of ($50~\mathrm{cMpc}$)$^{3}$. We train Gaussian
process emulators on these simulations to predict the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass
function (GSMF) and size - stellar mass relation (SSMR) as functions of the
model parameters, which we then fit to observations. The trained emulators not
only provide the best-fitting parameter values but also enable us to
investigate how different aspects of the prescriptions for supernova and AGN
feedback affect the predictions. In particular, we demonstrate that while the
observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR can be matched individually with a relatively
simple supernova feedback model, simultaneously reproducing both necessitates a
more sophisticated prescription. We show that the calibrated m7 COLIBRE model
not only reproduces the calibration target observables, but also matches
various other galaxy properties to which the model was not calibrated. Finally,
we apply the calibrated m7 model to the m6 and m5 resolutions and, after slight
manual adjustments of the subgrid parameters, achieve a similar level of
agreement with the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03569v1" target="_blank"><h2>Axion lines from nuclear de-excitations in galactic stellar populations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Orion Ning, Anupam Ray, Benjamin R.

times in a given waveband, we should still be detecting significantly more
variability if traditional sub-Eddington AGN variability models can be applied
to LRDs. Instead, our super-Eddington model light curves are consistent with
the lack of observed LRD variability. In addition, the ongoing high-cadence
{\sc nexus} campaign will detect changes in magnitude, $\Delta m>1$, for
traditional sub-Eddington models, but will only observe significant continuum
variability for the lowest mass LRDs for our super-Eddington AGN models. Even
if LRDs lack continuum variability, we find that the ongoing spectroscopic JWST
campaign {\sc twinkle} should observe broad emission line variability as long
as soft X-ray irradiation manages to reach the broad line region from the inner
disk. Our models show that super-Eddington accretion can easily explain the
lack of continuum variability in LRDs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03582v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere cosmic shear project V:

shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap
of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million
galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract
constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$
and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9
\sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to
dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor)
improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic
oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons
on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent
constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the
astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for
mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx
0.3\sigma$ in the $S_8, \Omega_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with
dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new
information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales.
Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will
be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements.
The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to
date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for
analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs,
data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.</p></br></body>
