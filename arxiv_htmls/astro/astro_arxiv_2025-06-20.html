  diffuse gas in the cosmic web</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Yuning Zhang, Dandan Xu, Chengzhe Li, Wei Cui</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> halo (title, abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and
galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical
properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However,
the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always
include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the
target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via
different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting
theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from
intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid
of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and
estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting
galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the
intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is
gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the
diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web
structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that
permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line
emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray
band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound
to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent
galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along
the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as
measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the
emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15345v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI:

filaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of
galaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is
channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct
observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of
mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data
combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a
high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2<z<0.8. Local filaments
are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M*
$> 10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, using other nearby galaxies as tracers and a
probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm, designed to overcome
limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is
tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models and
reference lightcone simulations. We recover the expected increase in galaxy
connectivity, defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy, with
stellar mass. Interestingly, we find a persistent correlation between
connectivity and star formation in medium mass galaxies (M* $= 10^{10-11}$
$\mathrm{M}_\odot$) in the low redshift bins. These results are consistent with
the cosmic web detachment scenario, suggesting that reduced connectivity to
local filaments hinders the inflow of star-forming material. We propose galaxy
connectivity to local (small-scale) filaments as a powerful and physically
motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic
structure in galaxy evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15286v1" target="_blank"><h2>MICONIC: JWST/MIRI MRS reveals a fast ionized gas outflow in the central

central region (~7-14"~100-200pc) of the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We used
JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28$\mu$m observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization
of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases
present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from
the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is
extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from
low IP emission lines and H$_2$ transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases
present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal
several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation
predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM.
These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles ($\sigma$~600km/s),
high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region,
velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and
enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find
evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We
compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and
radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy
to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H$_2$ lines can
be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component.
The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas.
There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H$_2$ outflow, only a weak
blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H$_2$
column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio
jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy. (Abridged)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15322v1" target="_blank"><h2>Overdense fireworks in GOODS-N: Unveiling a record number of massive

ten bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$5.2 in the GOODS-N field.
Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and
S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members
of the exceptional large-scale structure at z$\sim$5.1-5.3, which is notably
elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the
spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.182, a massive
dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and
N2GN_1_61 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition
to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify five further
candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure.
These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 10$^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$) and highly obscured (with a median A$_V$ of 2.9), caught in a
short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z$\sim$5.2. Their high SFRs (with a
median of 680 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), efficient baryon to stellar mass
conversion ($\epsilon_{\star}>$20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust
content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies
reside in overdense filaments, while the remaining four may trace new distinct
structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty
galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more
than the numerous H$_{\alpha}$ emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star
formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated
evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15059v1" target="_blank"><h2>Galactic seismology: can the Gaia 'phase spiral' co-exist with a clumpy,

in the z-Vz phase plane throughout the solar neighbourhood, where z and Vz are
the displacement and velocity of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As
demonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic
stellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance in the recent past (~0.3-3
Gyr). However, previous controlled simulations did not consider the impact of
the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is
crucial because it has been suggested that this weak signal is highly
susceptible to scattering by small-scale density fluctuations typical of the
ISM. This has motivated us to explore the formation and fate of the PS in a
high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamical simulation of an idealised Galaxy
analogue bearing a realistic ISM, which interacts impulsively with a massive
perturber. In our models, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage
vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to
drive turbulence. We find that the PS is almost non-existent if the ISM has an
excess of power on sub-kiloparsec scales compared to longer wavelengths. This
can happen in the absence of star formation and feedback when the gas is
allowed to cool. In the presence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar
feedback, the PS has a patchy spatial distribution and a high degree of
intermittency on kiloparsec scales. We anticipate that future studies of the
phase-spiral behaviour on all scales will provide crucial information on
star-gas dynamics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15060v1" target="_blank"><h2>GalaxyGenius: A Mock Galaxy Image Generator for Various Telescopes from

introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy
images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations.
The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube
generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module
extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo
from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the
following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above
information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely-used
radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED
assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an
IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal
data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes while also
incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs),
and background noise to generate desired mock observational images of galaxies.
To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, We create a series of mock images of
galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and
ground-based surveys spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength
coverages, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius
offers a flexible framework developed to generate mock galaxy images with
customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references
for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research, and they
can also act as training sets for deep learning relevant studies where real
observational data are insufficient.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15090v1" target="_blank"><h2>EMUSE: Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nikhel Gupta, Zeeshan Hayder, Minh Huynh, Ray P.

our work integrates visual and textual embeddings to enable efficient and
flexible searches within large radio astronomical datasets. We fine-tune
OpenCLIP using a dataset of 2,900 radio galaxies, encompassing various
morphological classes, including FR-I, FR-II, FR-x, R-type, and other rare and

ensuring computational efficiency while capturing the unique characteristics of

seamless image- and text-based queries over the EMU survey dataset. Our results
demonstrate the model's effectiveness in retrieving and classifying radio

challenges remain in identifying rare or previously unseen radio sources,
highlighting the need for expanded datasets and continuous refinement. This

galaxy pre-processing as they fall into clusters. We present the first case
study of a coalesced late-type dwarf major merger (VCC 479; stellar mass
$\sim\,8\,\times\,10^7\,\rm M_\odot$) that has undergone significant
environmental influence, with the aim of exploring dwarf galaxy evolution under
the combined effects of galaxy interactions and environmental processes, and
understanding its relevance to the diversity of dwarf galaxies in cluster
environments. Our analysis is based on VLA and FAST HI emission line mapping
from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) survey. We also
perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf-dwarf mergers to help
interpret the observations. We identify symmetric stellar shell structures in
VCC 479, indicative of a coalesced major merger of dwarf galaxies. The galaxy
features a central starburst, initiated $\sim$600 Myr ago, embedded within an
exponential disk quenched $\sim$1 Gyr ago. The starburst contributes only
2.9$\pm$0.5\% of the total stellar mass, and VCC 479's global star formation
rate is 0.3 dex lower than typical dwarfs of similar mass. The galaxy is highly
HI deficient, with most HI gas concentrated within the central 1 kpc and little
extended HI envelope. The misalignment of the HI velocity field with the
stellar body is best explained by merger-triggered gas inflow, as seen in our
simulations. Our analysis is consistent with a scenario that the majority of HI
gas of the progenitor galaxies was removed by the cluster environment prior to
the final coalescence. The merger concentrates the remaining gas toward the
galaxy center, triggering a central starburst. The combined effect of
environment stripping and galaxy merger has transformed VCC 479 into a
blue-core dwarf undergoing morphological transition from a late-type to an
early-type galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15618v1" target="_blank"><h2>The Infinity Galaxy: a Candidate Direct-Collapse Supermassive Black Hole

galaxy, in JWST imaging of the COSMOS field. Its rest-frame near-IR light is
dominated by two compact nuclei with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ Msun and
a projected separation of 10 kpc. Both nuclei have a prominent ring or shell
around them, giving the galaxy the appearance of a figure eight or an $\infty$
symbol. The morphology resembles that of the nearby system II Hz 4, where the
head-on collision of two galaxies with parallel disks led to the formation of
collisional rings around both of their bulges. Keck spectroscopy, VLA radio
data, and Chandra X-ray data show that the $\infty$ galaxy hosts an actively
accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), with quasar-like radio and X-ray
luminosity. Remarkably, the SMBH is not associated with either of the two
nuclei, but is in between them in both position and radial velocity.
Furthermore, from excess emission in the NIRCAM F150W filter we infer that the
SMBH is embedded in an extended distribution of H$\alpha$-emitting gas, with a
rest-frame equivalent width ranging from 400 - 2000 Angstrom. The gas spans the
entire width of the system and was likely shocked and compressed at the
collision site, in a galaxy-scale equivalent of what happened in the bullet
cluster. We suggest that the SMBH formed within this gas in the immediate
aftermath of the collision, when it was dense and highly turbulent. If
corroborated with simulations and follow-up JWST spectroscopy, this would
demonstrate that `direct' SMBH formation by a runaway gravitational collapse is
possible in extreme conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15358v1" target="_blank"><h2>Expanding the Ice Inventory of NGC 1333 IRAS 2A with INDRA using JWST

However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features
particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We
present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval
Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate
removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS),
and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to
NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars
(JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical
depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption
using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our
results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and
COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features
from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories
contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various
ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral
fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are
likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl

supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result
of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In
van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from
shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational
collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained NIRSpec IFU
observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between
the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next,
we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in
the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it
would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were
associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is
within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH
formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active
SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim
3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from
one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results
strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy
is a newly formed SMBH.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15536v1" target="_blank"><h2>Rotationally inelastic scattering of cyanocyclopentadiene by helium

believed to be an important carbon reservoir, accounting for up to a quarter of
all interstellar carbon in our galaxy. This makes the investigation of their
potential formation precursors highly relevant in the context of ISM chemistry.
This, in turn, includes knowing the abundance of the precursor species. One of
the possible precursor molecules for PAHs is the recently detected
cyanocyclopentadiene, c-C$_5$H$_5$CN. Given the physical conditions of the
dense dark molecular cloud TMC-1 where the cyclic species was detected, it is
crucial to consider that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions may not be
satisfied. In such case an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance
involves taking into account the competition between the radiative and
collisional processes, which requires the knowledge of rotational excitation
data for collisions with the most abundant interstellar species - He or H$_2$.
In this paper the first potential energy surface (PES) for the interaction of
the most stable isomer of cyanocyclopentadiene (1-cyano-1,3-cyclopentadiene)
with He atoms is computed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster
theory [CCSD(T)-F12]. The obtained PES demonstrates a high anisotropy and is
characterized by a global potential well of -101.8 cm$^{-1}$. Scattering
calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of 1-cyano-cyclopentadiene
induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum mechanical close-coupling
method for total energies up to 125 cm$^{-1}$. The resulting rotational
state-to-state cross sections are used to compute the corresponding rate
coefficients for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favoring the transitions
with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15282v1" target="_blank"><h2>Gravitational influence of the globular cluster NGC 7078 (M 15) flyby of

well as the effect of external gravitational forces on its dynamics over time.
Aims. In our study of the gravitational effects of the flyby of the NGC 7078 or
M 15 GC on the Oort cloud, we focus on two types of approximation. First, we
investigate the impact on the Sun's orbit during close passages, treating the
GC as a point mass. At the second stage, we use a complete N-body system
representation of the GC comprising over one million particles. Methods. We
carried out a dynamical study of the gravitational interaction between Oort
cloud particles and galactic GCs within the time-varying galactic external
potential. Initially, the GCs are represented as point masses orbiting the
Galaxy alongside the Sun and the Oort cloud system. Results. Our study reveals
significant variations in the impact of NGC 7078 on the Oort cloud, depending
on whether it is modelled as a point mass or a complete N-body system. The
N-body system results in much greater stripping of Oort cloud particles, with
over 52% stripped during a close pass, compared to a few percent in the point
mass model for a flyby at a large distance (>200 pc) and 36% for a closer 10 pc
point mass flyby. The N-body system also causes substantial expansion, with
particles spreading over 50 pc from the Sun within 30 Myr after the GC's
crossing. This creates a twisted and flattened cloud structure with extended
outer tails. These stripped cloud particles (more than 10%) spread across the
galaxy, reaching distances of up to 16 kpc from the Sun.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15262v1" target="_blank"><h2>The effects of continuum fitting on Lyman-$α$ forest correlations</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Nicolas Busca, James Rich, Julian Bautista, Andrei Cuceu, Andreu Font-Ribera, Julien Guy, Hiram K.

high-redshift quasars have been observed by the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation
Spectroscopy Survey (BOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI)
survey where they have revealed the effects of baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO). In order to fit the correlation functions to a physical model and
thereby constrain cosmological parameters, it is necessary to take into account
the effects of fitting the observed spectra to a template about which the
fluctuations are measured. In this paper we use mock spectra to test the
distortion matrix technique that has been used since the final BOSS data
release to appropriately distort the models. We show that while percent-level
effects on the derived forest bias parameters may be present, the technique
works sufficiently well that the determination of the BAO peak position is not
affected at the percent level. We introduce modifications in the technique used
by DESI that were not in the original applications and suggest further
possibilities for improvements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15178v1" target="_blank"><h2>Limits to star formation in post starburst galaxies from Type II

spectroscopic surveys. We present a new detailed spectroscopic analysis of 68
Kepler red giant stars to provide a suite of high-precision abundances along
with asteroseismic ages with better than 10 percent precision from individual
mode frequencies. We obtained several chemical clocks as ratios between
s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce) and alpha-elements (Mg, Ca, Si, Al, Ti).
Our data show that [Ce/Mg] and [Zr/Ti] display a remarkably tight correlation
with stellar ages, with abundance dispersions of 0.08 and 0.01 dex respectively
and below 3 Gyr in ages, across the entire Galactic chronochemical history.
While improving the precision floor of spectroscopic surveys is critical for
broadening the scope and applicability of chemical clocks, the intrinsic
accuracy of our relations -- enabled by high-resolution chemical abundances and
stellar ages in our sample -- allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about
age trends across stellar populations. By applying our relations to the APOGEE
and Gaia-ESO surveys, we are able to differentiate the low- and high-alpha
sequences in age, recover the age-metallicity relation, observe the disc
flaring of the Milky Way, and identify a population of old metal-rich stars.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15091v1" target="_blank"><h2>Could We Be Fooled about Phantom Crossing?</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Ryan E. Keeley, Arman Shafieloo, William L. Matthewson</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> No comments</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> DESI (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent data from DESI Year 2 BAO, Planck CMB, and various supernova
compilations suggest a preference for evolving dark energy, with hints that the
equation of state may cross the phantom divide line ($w = -1$). While this
behavior is seen in both parametric and non-parametric reconstructions,
comparing reconstructions that support such behavior (such as the best fit of
CPL) with those that maintain $w>-1$ (like the best fit algebraic quintessence)
is not straightforward, as they differ in flexibility and structure, and are
not necessarily nested within one another. Thus, the question remains as to
whether the crossing behavior that we observe, suggested by the data, truly
represents a dark energy model that crosses the phantom divide line, or if it
could instead be a result of data fluctuations and the way the data are
distributed. We investigate the likelihood of this possibility. For this
analysis we perform 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations based on a fiducial algebraic
quintessence model. We find that in $3.2 \% $ of cases, CPL with phantom
crossing not only fits better, but exceeds the real-data $\chi^2$ improvement.
This Monte Carlo approach quantifies to what extent statistical fluctuations
and the specific distribution of the data could fool us into thinking the
phantom divide line is crossed, when it is not. Although evolving dark energy
remains a robust signal, and crossing $w=-1$ a viable phenomenological solution
that seems to be preferred by the data, its precise behavior requires deeper
investigation with more precise data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15476v1" target="_blank"><h2>Impeding Turbulence Decay in Self-gravitating Cloud Cores</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Shibo Yuan, Hua-Bai Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 9 pages, 5 figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Turbulence governs the fragmentation of molecular clouds and plays a pivotal
role in star formation. The persistence of observed cloud turbulence suggests
it does not decay significantly within the turnover timescale, implying a
recurrent driving mechanism. Although ubiquitous self-gravity is a plausible
driver, MHD simulations by \citet{ostriker2001density} demonstrated that
self-gravity alone does not modify the global turbulence decay rate. In this
study, we demonstrate that the dominant diffuse volume of a cloud dictates its
overall decay rate, while individual dense cores can maintain near-zero decay
rates. Crucially, this phenomenon is absent in control simulations excluding
self-gravity. This discrepancy cannot be attributed to contamination of
turbulent velocities by core contraction, as most cores in our simulations
remain in a quasi-equilibrium state. Our analysis reveals that the
gravitational potential energy released during core formation\textemdash not
necessarily driven by self-gravity but also by turbulent compression\textemdash
is sufficient to sustain the observed turbulence levels within cores.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15644v1" target="_blank"><h2>Candidate Dark Galaxy-2: Validation and Analysis of an Almost Dark

Published in ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> Euclid (abstract), halo (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Candidate Dark Galaxy-2 (CDG-2) is a potential dark galaxy consisting of four
globular clusters (GCs) in the Perseus cluster, first identified in Li et al.
(2025) through a sophisticated statistical method. The method searched for
over-densities of GCs from a \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (\textit{HST})
survey targeting Perseus. Using the same \textit{HST} images and the new
imaging data from the \textit{Euclid} survey, we report the detection of
extremely faint but significant diffuse emission around the four GCs of CDG-2.
We thus have exceptionally strong evidence that CDG-2 is a galaxy. This is the
first galaxy detected purely through its GC population. Under the conservative
assumption that the four GCs make up the entire GC population, preliminary
analysis shows that CDG-2 has a total luminosity of $L_{V, \mathrm{gal}}=
6.2\pm{3.0} \times 10^6 L_{\odot}$ and a minimum GC luminosity of $L_{V,
\mathrm{GC}}= 1.03\pm{0.2}\times 10^6 L_{\odot}$. Our results indicate that
CDG-2 is one of the faintest galaxies having associated GCs, while at least
$\sim 16.6\%$ of its light is contained in its GC population. This ratio is
likely to be much higher ($\sim 33\%$) if CDG-2 has a canonical GC luminosity
function (GCLF). In addition, if the previously observed GC-to-halo mass
relations apply to CDG-2, it would have a minimum dark matter halo mass
fraction of $99.94\%$ to $99.98\%$. If it has a canonical GCLF, then the dark
matter halo mass fraction is $\gtrsim 99.99\%$. Therefore, CDG-2 may be the
most GC dominated galaxy and potentially one of the most dark matter dominated
galaxies ever discovered.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15039v1" target="_blank"><h2>Unveiling the Cosmic Dance of Repeated Nuclear Transient ASASSN-14ko:

We conducted
high-cadence, multiwavelength observations of this source, revealing several
recurrent early bumps and rebrightenings in its UV/optical light curves. The
energy released during these bumps and rebrightenings shows a diminishing trend
in recent UV/optical outbursts, which we monitored through multiwavelength
observations. These features can be ascribed to the interaction between stream
debris and the expanded disk in the repeated partial tidal disruption event.
The X-ray light curve exhibits an inverse pattern compared to the UV/optical
bands, displaying sporadic outbursts. Furthermore, our observations demonstrate
that the blackbody temperature and radius in each outburst increase with the
UV/optical luminosity, and such evolution resembles that observed in X-ray
quasiperiodic eruptions, whereas distinguishing it from typical tidal
disruption events.</p></br></body>
