Rubin Observatory LSST is expected to discover tens of millions
of new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The survey's exceptional cadence and
sensitivity will enable UV/optical/NIR monitoring of a significant fraction of
these objects. The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic
follow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most
studies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are
traditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work
presents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that
leverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and
wavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the
variability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a
parametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\tau$) and asymptotic
amplitude of the variability (SF$_\infty$) based on the redshift, the
rest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based
photo-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW
parameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift
(VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the
redshift estimates from SED fitting.
  Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating
significant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison
with SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision. The
simulated light curves with both SDSS and LSST-like cadences and baselines
confirm that, VAR-PZ will be able to constrain the photometric redshifts of
SDSS-like AGNs by bringing the outlier fractions down to below 7% from 32%
(SED-alone) at the end of the survey.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12978v1" target="_blank"><h2>Magnetic Reconnection as a Potential Driver of X-ray Variability in

quasars at z > 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and
archival multi-epoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements
were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is
found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term
(hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with
short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation
exists between the global mean ($\mu_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) and standard
deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is
independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The
localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which
can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and
satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\sigma$-$\mu$ correlation
parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive
short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z
quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity
distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not
conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7),
which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated
in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an
ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is
found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a
period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of
plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge
successively.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12352v1" target="_blank"><h2>Predicting stellar collision outcomes of main sequence stars</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Pau Amaro Seoane</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted, 11 pages</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> active galactic nuclei (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in
fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The
gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion,
influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption
events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately
predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and
unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing
smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are
too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We
develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\sim 16,000$ SPH
simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically
meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial
ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we
create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method
includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to
ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision
outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors
respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second,
enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter
importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity
dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach
provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei.
The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH
accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time,
particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11563v1" target="_blank"><h2>Scaling relations at the central regions of nearby galaxies</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Patrícia da Silva, R.

evidence for investigating the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. In
most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the
galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these
relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a
subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to
analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar
population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and
circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar
velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These
correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all
morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic
bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar
velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies.
It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar
mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show
younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the
central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star
formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between
stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their
nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a
consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely,
starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one
billion years.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12306v1" target="_blank"><h2>Off-center black hole seed formation? Implications for high and low
  redshift massive black holes</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  David Izquierdo-Villalba, Daniele Spinoso, Marta Volonteri, Monica Colpi, Alberto Sesana, Silvia Bonoli</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> Submitted to A&A. 9 Figures</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> JWST (abstract), ISM (abstract), quasar (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive
black holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their
birthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas
and merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center
formation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black
hole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the
$\texttt{L-Galaxies}{\it BH}$ semi-analytical model, which includes multiple
seed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most
significant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the
model to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the
galactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that
seed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact
on the MBH population at $z<1$, but causes significant differences at higher
redshifts. Particularly, the abundance of $10^5 M_{\odot}$ MBHs at $z>4$ can be
up to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar
luminosity functions with $\rm L_{bol}>10^{44} \rm erg/s$ are similarly
affected, although they still align with observational constraints. The
off-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At $z>5$, the
amplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed
models. These differences fade by $z \sim 2$ for galaxies $>10^{11} M_{\odot}$,
and by $z=0$ for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population
recently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can
form independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs
within LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a
suppression of events at high-$z$ and an enhancement at low-$z$.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12177v1" target="_blank"><h2>A New Population of Point-like, Narrow-line Objects Revealed by the

James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by their point-like
morphology and narrow permitted emission lines. Our sample includes nine
objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and
M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles,
with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%--34.6% larger than
those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to
only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median
rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the
line widths of the latter are only 150--360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the
current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The
emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with
being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the
nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest
that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming
(median star formation rate of 1.8 Msun/yr) galaxies in the early formation
stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^{8.4} Msun). If they
are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from
12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by
deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they
constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost
"hostless". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind
whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact
core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12067v1" target="_blank"><h2>Observational Evidence of Dust Evolution in Supernova Remnants: Size
  Redistribution Toward Larger Grains in Early Sedov Phase</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  He Zhao, Bingqiu Chen, Jun Li</br><strong><u>Categories:</u></strong> astro-ph.GA</br><strong><u>Comments:</u></strong> 12 pages, 1 table, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> dust (title, abstract), dust evolution (title), ISM (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Recent observations have revealed that dust is widespread and abundant in
galaxies up to $z\,{\backsimeq}\,8$, significantly influencing their appearance
and spectral properties. In the early Universe, dust is thought to form
primarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the
reverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different
sizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution
during cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R_{\rm V}$ map, we derived
local $R_{\rm V} \equiv A_{\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs
in the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For
the first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the
difference in SNR and ISM $R_{\rm V}$ ($\Delta R_{\rm V}$) and SNR radius
($R_{\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r_{\rm
s}\,{=}\,0.62\,{\pm}\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence
for a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock
processing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential
observational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important
implications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the
early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12922v1" target="_blank"><h2>Evolution of the infrared luminosity function and its corresponding

function (FIR LF) and the resulting inferred evolution of dust-obscured
star-formation rate density (SFRD) out to redshift z~6. To establish the
evolving co-moving number density of FIR-bright objects, we make use of the
high-resolution ALMA follow-up study (AS2UDS), of the JCMT SCUBA-2 Cosmology
Legacy Survey (S2CLS) sub-mm imaging in the UKIDSS UDS survey field. In order
to estimate the contributions of faint/low-mass sources we implement a method
in which the faint-end of the IR LF is inferred by stacking (in stellar mass
and redshift bins) the optical/near-infrared samples of star-forming galaxies
into the appropriate FIR Herschel and sub-mm JCMT maps. Using this information
we determine the faint-end slope of the FIR LF in two intermediate redshift
bins (where it can be robustly established) and then adopt this result at all
other redshifts. The evolution of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy
FIR LF, L*, is found to be increase monotonically with redshift, evolving as
z^1.38+-0.07, while the characteristic number density is well fitted by double
power-law function, constant at z<2.24 and declining as z^-4.95+-0.73 at higher
redshifts. The evolution of the corresponding dust-obscured star-formation rate
density was then calculated and is here compared with the results from a number
of recent studies in the literature. Our analysis confirms that dust-obscured
star-formation activity dominates SFRD at cosmic noon, but then becomes
progressively less important with increasing redshift: while dusty star-forming
galaxies are still found out to the highest redshifts explored here, UV-visible
star formation dominates at z>4, and dust-obscured activity contributes <25% of
SFRD by z~6.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12998v1" target="_blank"><h2>Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the GeV excess in the Galactic

Comments are welcome</br><strong><u>Matching Keywords:</u></strong> AGN (abstract)</br><p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> The GeV $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains
unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading
interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of
millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with
electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are
strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We
investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the
millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.
  We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries
under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which
systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario,
in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only
$10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA.
Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands
of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses
($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions
($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$).
  LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses
can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems.
Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double
white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable
targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test
of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12035v1" target="_blank"><h2>The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on

type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range -
from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and
$Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups
according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate
(SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at
distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts;
Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive
hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest
slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with
$\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$
significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest
colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After
correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in
Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($>3\sigma$)
brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses
should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which
the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological
analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy
a single region of this plane.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11827v1" target="_blank"><h2>A comprehensive view of PKS 2155-304 from 2008 to 2023 through a

the emission from the blazar PKS 2155-304, a high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP)
blazar. Using $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, optical/UV, and infrared data assembled from
the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center, we constructed multi-band light
curves and temporally resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of PKS
2155-304 to probe the origin of its emission. The light curves show significant
variability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the
optical/UV, and 0.65 in $\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for
HSPs. Segmenting the $\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined
253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them
into quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\gamma$-ray flares
($\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is
modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that
self-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network
surrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
reveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the
magnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during
$\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and
$\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF,
changes in B, $L_{e}$, $\gamma_{max}$, $\delta$, and p are found while the
emitting-zone size remains approximately constant. The jet power is
electron-dominated (magnetic-to-electron power ratio
$\eta_{B}\simeq0.09-0.17$), with $\eta_{B}$ rising during XF. These results
suggest that variations in acceleration efficiency and magnetization drive
band-dependent flaring in PKS 2155-304.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12319v1" target="_blank"><h2>Cosmology with supernova Encore in the strong lensing cluster MACS

seven independent mass models of the galaxy cluster built using six software
packages. By conducting a blind analysis (no exchanges of results between
modeling teams), we quantified uncertainties due to modeling and software.
Through HST, JWST and MUSE observations, we assembled high-quality data
products, including eight "gold" lensed image systems consisting of 23 images
with secure spectroscopic redshifts, and one "silver" system with a likely
redshift value. Restricting to the gold images, we obtain overall consistent
model predictions of the positions, magnifications and time delays of SN Encore
and SN Requiem images, especially for models with $\chi^2 \leq 25$. We predict
the appearance of the next images of SNe Encore and Requiem with a time delay
of >~3000 days and of ~3700 to 4000 days, respectively, based on a fiducial
cosmological model of $H_0 = 70 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m} = 0.3$. We obtain relations between $H_0$ and the time delays of SNe Encore
and Requiem. In particular, for $H_0 = 73 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, the
four lowest $\chi^2$ models predict SN Requiem to reappear in ~Apr-Dec 2026;
for $H_0 = 67 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, in ~Mar-Nov 2027. Using the newly

66.9^{+11.2}_{-8.1}\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, where the uncertainty is dominated
by that of the time delay. The long delays of the next-appearing SN Requiem and
SN Encore images provide excellent opportunities to measure $H_0$ with an

for galaxy formation, reionization, and the fundamental physics of dark matter.
However, the population of Milky Way satellites includes the faintest known
galaxies, and current observations are incomplete. To understand the impact of
observational selection effects on the known satellite population, we perform
rigorous, quantitative estimates of the Milky Way satellite galaxy detection
efficiency in three wide-field survey datasets: the Dark Energy Survey Year 6,
the DECam Local Volume Exploration Data Release 3, and the Pan-STARRS1 Data
Release 1. Together, these surveys cover $\sim$13,600 deg$^2$ to $g \sim 24.0$
and $\sim$27,700 deg$^2$ to $g \sim 22.5$, spanning $\sim$91% of the
high-Galactic-latitude sky ($|b| \geq 15^\circ$). We apply multiple detection
algorithms over the combined footprint and recover 49 known satellites above a
strict census detection threshold. To characterize the sensitivity of our
census, we run our detection algorithms on a large set of simulated galaxies
injected into the survey data, which allows us to develop models that predict
the detectability of satellites as a function of their properties. We then fit
an empirical model to our data and infer the luminosity function, radial
distribution, and size-luminosity relation of Milky Way satellite galaxies. Our
empirical model predicts a total of $265^{+79}_{-47}$ satellite galaxies with
$-20 \leq M_V \leq 0$, half-light radii of $15 \leq r_{1/2} (\rm pc) \leq
3000$, and galactocentric distances of $10 \leq D_{\rm GC} (\rm kpc) \leq 300$.
We also identify a mild anisotropy in the angular distribution of the observed
galaxies, at a significance of $\sim$$2\sigma$, which can be attributed to the
clustering of satellites associated with the LMC.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12308v1" target="_blank"><h2>Death by Impact: Evidence for Merger-Driven Quenching in a Collisional
  Ring Galaxy at Cosmic Noon</h2></a><strong><u>Authors:</u></strong>  Amir H. Khoram, Sirio Belli, Carlo Nipoti, Raffaele Pascale, Andrew B. Newman, Federico Marinacci, Richard S.

galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty
of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a
unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the
interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from
star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$
in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$)
with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\star =
10^{11.2} M_\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\sim 8$ kpc. Combining
JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling
evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching
in the Bullet. The ring, $\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at
$127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr
ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the
Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by
the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding
starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel.
Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence
and disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional
possibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows
from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby
preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.</p></br></body>
